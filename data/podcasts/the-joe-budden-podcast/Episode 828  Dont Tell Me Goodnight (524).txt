You just signed the contract. Whoa. What'd that mean here? My shit ain't changed on way. Wait my route on my new paragraphs in there. No can more like never. Alright, that's cool. I don't wanna argue. When is the last time you spoke to your attorney? Two days ago. Okay. Mm. There's no new paragraphs. I wasn't befuddle or trick regarding what? It's still streaming application. I can still get up and go when I want. I can still leave when I want. Like that's the same thing. As long as that's in play, that's all that matters. Stream you. Yeah. Maybe I need to talk to mine. Yeah, maybe I need to talk to mine.


So anyway, we don't do contract talks on the spot, you know That's true. No we don't. I two, I'm gonna get to you. What you try to do this weekend. I'll get to you. Hour two, tell your mans and then what you try to do to me and JR I two treat y'all with love, kindness, respect, consideration, and courtesy. No, you try to, even though that shit pissed me off too. Like when you go to a store or you go to the restaurant and you order something and the waiter or waitress tell you what it costs. You did that. Did I do that? What you mean? They tell you what it costs. Like market price, like Yeah I guess just tell you if It is a restaurant or a store, it's different. It is.


What's the difference? I don't see nonce difference because in a restaurant sometimes it'll say to Parks point, market price. Cool. So the market goes up and down. But if it's not market price, don't tell me the price. If I asked for it, but if I didn't ask, if I didn't ask what the price was, I asked for it. Good point. And if and if we somewhere where the menu says market price or don't have no prices, then it's in bad It is it in bad taste for the waiter to even You are correct. Do that. Where was the training at? You're correct. Agreed. Yeah. Yes, I did that to flip. You are correct. Wait, what? I did that to flip. Told him what something cost. Yeah. Why? It's contextual. I was trying to be kind. I ain't wanna be a dick.


I was trying to be considerate. Why? Flip said yo, take me to the game. Flip said yo, send me a barber. And I said that's you. You being a dick. That is. Thank you. Wait, watch Dick definitely being a dick. You're lying. You are being a dick. He said I don't think you could afford this. You're being facetious. Not I'm gonna be for real. I'm dead ass. I'm dead ass. You tell it to me, you know how much you pay. Flip. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me finish. Let finish please. Let's, I'm gonna lay on my plane. You know how much you pay. We'll fly today boy. Right. So I don't We good time today. We don't know what that number is. However, I know that number is enough to pay for your barber. I know your barber so I know that you know what you pay flip and I know that number is enough to pay for his haircut. I think that is important takes to do.


Wait, what I think what you just said is important takes to do. I can't just gauge what type of lifestyle y'all have. What type of ancillary income y'all have. The same way the waiter can't gauge. I can't do the same way. The waiter can't gauge that you can't pay for the lobster because the price went up 20%. Now I do think if you ordered something extra like louisie or something like that, something extremely ah crazy like, or a very expensive bottle of champagne. I could see them saying, hey, just to let you know this is man Dude that ordered the Louisie. The 13 wanted the Louisie. The 13 dude that ordered the Macallan 30 wanted the Macallan thirties. I know what the Fuck. It also depends on the restaurant you're in. 'cause if you're in a restaurant that's not the super nicest, you may have had people run out on your shit.


The Word that is true barber is misleading a audience. I promise y'all we gonna start. No, this is good conversation. It is the word barber is is vague. That's true. There is no what is market price. If you're talking to your homie, you're not assuming that everybody knows market price. That is true for a barber. Especially one coming to your house. Especially one that put the good rag. Yeah, but the good rag give you a little scout massage this nigga. Try to, this nigga is bullshitting, bro. I'm badass. Gimme, gimme a barber. Listen, gimme your barber's number. He said I'm gonna call you in the morning when he's cutting my head and call you.


So he wanted to be the middle man. I'm not. Yo, You freak. Send the number bro. Thank you. That's it. Oh wait, I don't even abide by those rules when it come to passing the numbers around. What y'all talking about? Come on. That's a good point. That's that's a good point. But you had to speak, you spoke to him. That's a no, that's a good point. But outside of the price, like y'all highlight my barber, see if he taking some customers. Thank you. And see if I could give you a number out. That's one thing the nigga started the conversation said yo flip. I'm gonna keep it real Wednesday. Nigga. This is a text from flip. Nigga share your barber. This is at three 40 in the afternoon. So I'm kind of already in whatever my mojo is for the day. Yeah, yeah.


Okay. Big game. Big game coming up. Yeah, I feel yeah, whatever Was going that was popping. You hear me? I say You didn't just shoot That for the number. I say you're not gonna want my barber buddy. It's insulting. LO s that that's insult. That's insulting. So I got on the phone. That's insulting though. I got on the phone and he said I'm flipping, I'm calling You. Right. He said why I'm not just texting no. Like I if the nigga die. No, I wanna know why because the nigga might not be, might not not be prompt. The nigga might not be, you know what I'm saying? Like we deal with people sometimes. I got some shit with 'em. But go ahead. Alright. Y'all are bringing me around to y'all point if y'all gonna say the death foul. So I didn't think that was fo No, tell him we talked on the phone. So we got on the phone and he was like, why? And I'm like, I just don't think you want to afford.


I didn't say, didn't say that. I didn't. You ain't say that? Yes. Y'all watch your mouth. Watch your I You can't afford I did not say that. You didn't say that. I did not say that. Said you said, I don't think you would want afford my boss. I don't think you want to pay the price that he's asking. That I Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Yeah. No, you modified it but go ahead. Yeah, what I just said is what I think I said down him, but okay anyway. I told him the price. Okay. Which is a little steep. What's your price? My barber's price. You can blank it out or, or the home visit. I ain't gotta blank it out. You think he's proud? His price. Alright. Okay. Hey back to, we'll talk about it later. Creator. Setting prices $250. Okay. It's a steep haircut. It is. That's a lot.


It is, It is. But you're paying for the luxury of him coming to your home. Sure. And the experience and the gas and Yeah, everything. Them sitting in traffic. You know Joe's scared to come of Es Essence County. And when they yo barber, that's one that's on the road from the barbershop that the barber is. And you wasn't know where I was at in Essex County though. Mm, I know. It is that part too. Yeah. He wasn't in the same So if he was in the rough area, you wasn't in, you would've been scared. He was in Phantom City. I was on Prince Street. Yeah. Right. The fuck is you talking about? Prince William Court? Ask about me on Prince Street though. Who am asking? Where what? Do you know what it look like over there? Wait, what?


Hey Corey. Hey Corey Talking about you lying. He had me gas. You lying. No, no, no, no. I'm definitely lying. You me, you. No, I'm lying nigga. Why did you say that? You made me mad lying All three of them. Nigga. They, they wouldn't know what the fuck would they know. Oh, they probably been out there now. I'm lying. But I was fly with at least seven niggas from Prince Street when I was in rehab in Newark. 'cause Prince Street is down the street. Got it. That's possible. So shout to Eric. I mean it's a few niggas, but was I going to Prince Street? No. They made sure to tell me if it's one place I did not want to go. It's Prince Street. It was Prince Street? Yeah. Got it. And, and hopefully nobody is double parked.


They take you your car. You was jacked. So flip. Do you wanna pay the two 50 for the haircut? Yeah. Regularly. Yeah. Well, I don't mind. I mean the, the, my barber but now, man, mess your head though. Like You think it he's gonna be able to save it because he called me like nine times this week about it. So I know that.

You first day of school. Yeah. You gotta be sharp. What? Talking about find what You put taxes. You put a bump on the, that's more than a didn. Didn't know that he was trying to take the haircut to go to.


That totally changes the pricing thing. I can't the birdman order to come to the pod. If the person you're doing business with knows what you intend to do with what you need from them, then the price can snitch you. I'm talking that shit today. I don't even feel well no already. Nah, look. Not you bugging. He's not bro's. You bugging. It was kind of, It is kind of similar to what, what what Che told Shannon Chopper about Birdman. He was like, yo, Wayne was so hot that when he was charging a hundred grand for the verse, Birdman would be like, yo, it's a hundred for Wayne and a hundred for me to get Wayne, for me to clear it for Wayne to do the verse Ish. No, I'm right. That's terrible. Putting the extra, that's not terrible because I know you want it.


And I know we're just going through, we'll we'll dive into some of that later in the, the s that other conversation in the other conversation. He's, he's disgusting. I'm not doing that bro. I'm not. Nah, I'm shit. That's crazy. Be lit with your ball. That's not. Then we gotta talk about that other call later though. Yeah. Later we can talk about that other phone call now audience.

We've, we've before You've told us tried to this before we before We've tried before. Yeah. But no, they switched it. It was the first 30 seconds to a minute. Yeah, they keep changing it. Oh okay.

Hey yo know boy, when they got you, when they got you like this, you got, you got out like the New Orleans escapees. Hey yo Corey buddy that door so I can escape it.


The middle of the night. Let's, that's a funny joke in narrative that I'm gonna lean into. But joke, you are willing signee, every time you rush True. You rush niggas ain't even got to call you and ring the bell. You can ring my you do time. When it's time to sign. You don't need nigga you catch me at all the right times. You don't need no coercion. You catch me at all the right times. Yeah. Pay. Oh shit. You know what I mean? You right. Let's get, let's get to it. Good boy. Hey treat your uncle right. Yeah. He trying to fucking, I don't want to talk about him so bad. I tried to do some old school, old school. You try to, you try to find different ways to finagle but you just can't sometimes you cannot.


When you are moving legit, you just can't do certain shit. Yeah. Now with the tax man. But don't come and do your bro man. Don't try to get over on your bro, man. 'cause you can't get over on the tax man. On the uncle. That's where it's offensive. That's where it hurts. Would you rather me get over on you than the law? Think about it. You'd rather me be home. I would rather you not get over on it. Well, life is about getting over Joe. It's not, it's not S not, it's not true. No. Life is about getting over Fox. It's not getting over in life. Did any life is about getting over on something. So, so when you're born, what do you have to get over? Like when does it start for you? That's back to my question. When does the game begin? You asked that question. We didn't get asked.


It's back to my question. This is kind of the same thing. What's your first thing you're getting over? You try to get over. It starts for me. It starts when you try to get over with your parents. The babysit, your parents babysit anybody in school. Like there's so many things that's childish thing. That doesn't, that's not, that doesn't, that's what over assume life. We shouldn said We shouldn take the lessons of childhood When it's time for my daughter to go to sleep. And she hit you with that. Y'all gotta pee. But why do You think it should carry This behavior into adulthood? Can I get some water? You get pulled over like all of that is getting over so that I can stay up and I don't gotta take my little ass to bed. You get pulled over by the cops. But why Should you carry that over into adulthood? I gotta give you saying that's the building block.


No, you get pulled over by the police. You get pulled over by the cops. They wanna write you a ticket. You know you were speeding your conversation trying to convince them that you wasn't speeding or it's an emergency or you allow you to go to the hospital. That's a form of trying to get over True in the situation. I don't really Do that. Why does, okay, If you got me on the thing, you got me on the thing. I paid the ticket and keep it pushing off. So that's how you feel about things. You good? Lemme just tell you that fire gave me a headache. What? You said that one Shit. I like that. I'm sorry. Yeah, you got me. Fuck it. You got me. Fuck. So you don't have, you don't engage or try to give it a reason or an excuse? I mean I Tried but not like I'm not gonna go out my way. I'm not going to try to beat this guy down for the fucking $125 ticket.


Yeah. Your Life know it ain't just that. It don't be the ticket, it's the insurance and the points, all that shit too. Yeah. Your life is greater than this. What nigga said I got you. Your life is greater than life is about getting over whether you want to admit it or not. So what are you trying to get over now? Nothing know that's not true. It sings in life well. Like what? Oh it could be and I'm not. No, no. It depend on what facet of life bro. We are always looking for an advance. What are you trying to get over right now then? M shit such as flip Uncle. I don't give a fuck about that nigga. If I could beat him, I'm beat him. He the number one on the list word. Whatcha you talking about? Get over him. Flip's uncle. Yeah, your uncle too. All our uncles. All our uncles. Oh that uncle. If you can get over a nigga, you can get over on him.


Stop. Yo. It's true. Stop bro. That doesn't equate to life. No, I That's heart of, it's the heart of life Joe. I, what? What am I trying to get at? They call me a con. You trying to get over nigga. You can too. Okay. I don't want us listen to this to be circular. No, no, no. Look, this is the thing. I don't think we saying the same thing. If I could get over on Uncle Sam, if any of us could get over on Uncle Sam, we will. We, we would. It equates to more money in your pocket True. For you and your family. Correct. What's the motherfucking t He, he like that's what we all would attempt to do. That's what the purpose of accountants and financial advisors are for, for you to, It is, those are legal remedies.


That's not really getting over, in my opinion. Finding a loophole is a over, It is getting over. It's not getting over to me. I don't think it, it's getting over either. But even if I wait, hold up. Even if I submit to his theory, when someone comes and asks me about my life and what I'm trying to do, I'm not saying I'm trying to get over. Nobody says that. No you just did. You think me and Parks and City are confused? Wait, hold on. Nobody says that initially. I'm talking to my friends. I think what Flip is saying is getting over is a major part of life. Not that purpose. Well Flip was raised, raised also by scammers and crooks. Who? My mother, my father, my mother's a hardwork woman. Nigga. Why tell the fucking mouth nigga. Ain't you supposed to have a conversation bud too? No outside. Stop trying to play my mom nigga before I knock you out.

All them niggas look like they had they lunch, they they lunchboxes pal. A pal? Yeah. Fuck Blue collar shit.

Now that's the way I, I didn't need to be in Joe bud seats but I needed a different seat. If I'm trying to talk to Dave Chappelle, what I'm trying to tell y'all is there was not a care carefree in the world Carefree for any Knick fan in that building. They had the T-shirts on the seats like OKC be doing. Everybody do. Oh I didn't know we ain't been here be in 25 years. I don't know what y'all do now for the Easter coffee final man as soon as I got in the car, yo.


That's the gangster shit. They got the t-shirts and ain't none of the niggas in the garden put them shits on. You go to them small markets. The whole stands be yellow. Put them on as soon as they get in. Yo New York is so fucking ignorant. The stands be yellow. The whole clothes in them small markets. Whatcha talking yo. I'm big. I'm big markety bias. God I'm not just New York bias, big market bias. Small ass closets out there. I'm talking shit. I'm rooting for the little niggas anyway. I get in the elevator and marrying every, hey by the time I get in my car and pull my phone out and cut Hulu on and turn the game on, I hear drama in the announcer's voice like and the building don't look like it did when I just left.


But on your walkout you ain't hear the Dr. Drama on the walkout? No. Really? No. No. Nigga that nigga, no we was high. You not understanding the entire building was high fiving.

And I'll take it a step further. Can a straight person ask that can yes. Yes. Would. Probably not.


The probability is low. Probably not. That's what I'm saying. I'll leave room for freaky shit. But it does lead you to believe that this may be a gay human being and there's nothing wrong with that. Well, I think that's the type of man that Cassie likes. Now, once Cudi took the stand and then I thought about the shit puff be doing, then I looked at the Alex dude, the dog. Okay. Hey, we all been in second grade before we all, we all did that thing. Right. I got skip. You talking about nigga. Oh. Oh shit. Oh. Oh man. I'm bugging you. I don't think Cassie likes bisexual men.

Which I don't think is gonna be as heavy handed as, as the public may want it to be. But we shall see. We shall see. I think it's, I think it's a long fight. I I, yeah, Probably like even with the Cudi shit, I don't look at it the way y'all look at it. Like, 'cause from a legal standpoint, if we going by legality, you can't prove Puff did none of that shit.


We all might know he did it, but you gotta prove that he did it because he is not on trial. No, we don't. Yeah. No we don't. That's not true. The, the, the claims he's making against Puff has to be proven. That has to be proven. You have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Sean Combs blew up your car. You have to prove that he broke into your house or had somebody break into your house. All of those things are speculative. Even if we know he did it again from the legal standpoint, you gotta prove he did it. Although, I'm not sure if he, I disagree. I don't know because he's not on trial for burning the car. He is on trial for racketeering. So I'm not sure if that's entirely true. No, I'm just saying. But true. They using these things. They trying prove that this happened. He's abusive or he's, you know, vindictive.


Whatever the case may be. I think it, It is cut and dry. Yo, Cassie is the victim. Ca Cassie is the victim. Yo, did you wanna do all this sexual freak off shit? She said no. Adding that to control, adding that to money, adding that, all the rest of the shit you're done. She's the victim. This is our sex trafficking case. You move somebody around that didn't want to be moved. She was scared to go outside. You blew up the nigga car when she ran over there. They, they paint a very clear picture. I don't think that they have to prove that shit that Cudi said. They just need the jury to hear it. Yeah, true. No, no, no. Now is that right? Exactly. That's what we saying. That's a, that's a talk for another day. But I think, I think it's tough to, for the jury to hear all of this shit that everybody is, is getting up there saying and saying, you know what, he ain't do that.


Let him go. They gotta show me that. True. They gotta show me that. Sure, sure. True. And again, the, the, the, the, the defense hasn't called up their witnesses yet. True. You know what I'm saying? So I think that this shit gonna be long. I think that we gonna find out a whole bunch of shit about a whole bunch of shit. And I think when it's all said and done, I think they gonna send him to jail. I think he's going to jail but I don't think he taking the long haul like everybody think he gonna take. Oh, I agree with that. I think they gonna prove like, yo, you, you can't just be doing this shit out here and walk SCO Free. Yeah, go sit for five. Yeah. Go, go sit for three and a half with Tom served whatever the case may be and bring your ass home. But I don't think that he gonna get over 10 Lauren London.


They're saying it's supposed to take the stand soon. I heard that too. I didn hear. Huh? Why I Don, I don know. I don't know. I know she was friends with Cassie is what they say. Oh, Okay. Oh, oh. So she might have some information Insight. Yeah, We'll see. We shall see. We'll see. Keep an eye out for it. It's a holiday weekend. Yeah. Yeah. So this holiday weekends are not for essay and sex trafficking at all. Not at kidnapping and nah. Vibe. Your favorite vibes. Your favorite uncle should be on the grill. Yeah, I'll be on the grill. Your cousin with some ridge should have the S Right. Like it should be music and vibes be a card table somewhere cutting diamonds from the red.

Couple, couple dollars. And they they hit, they ask you. No, they ask whoever in the yard when my uncles go around, hit my dad up. If I'm near my dad is dead. They done when they get that money and go bust that right down McCreary Road shit.


Yeah. Shit. No telling. Oh my God. When my family, so when, when your old school uncles ask first, when the old school uncles ask you, they come back with some cobras, all that shit, whatever them shit be 49 cent. When your uncles ask you for money and you don't carry cash, what you They don't do the cash ins. How you do it? You go to the bank, your uncle, I'm gonna take it out for you like It is uncle. You can't tell uncle no. It's coming in once. Nah, I might, I might got a stack of words on. I might have, I might have a couple dollars on me. Okay. Got it. Got it. Because I was in the airport, so maybe I went and got, got $40 or something. Couple single my family. Do you believe in telling older people? No, Joe. I know it's my favorite word.


So, but you are a family man, Joe. I don. I don. That means my family is something my favorite people to say no to. Okay. Talking about in real time. Yo Joey. Huh? Yo, I need, lemme, lemme get a couple of dollars. We gonna be back. You gonna tell him? No, I have. Yeah. Yo, this, this, this actually leads to a question. I was gonna say let's go for Paton. Have, have any of you ever got tired of showing up, showing up to a party? Showing up? No. Showing up. Showing up, showing up, showing up for people. I mean whether it be family, like you just be the one, you know, everybody could call. Yes. Yes and no. Yes and no. I think if you show up in the capacity, you're supposed to show up, you will eventually get tired of it.


Yeah. The people that really show up for people, I'm certain they get tired of it. Yeah. But they, they become so accustomed to showing up. So, and people, it becomes a norm and people be accustomed to you showing up and then you and you lean into it. It can be exhausting. It can be exhausting depending On I'm at, I'm at that point Depending on the People because I wanted to ask if it gets Reciproc. If it gets reciprocated then it's a nonstarter or, Or I think but do usually the people that show up the most, see, I don't even know. No one is there to show up for them. That's what I'm saying. They don't allow people to show up for them because they're the ones that take all the burden on their shoulders. So they don't allow anybody because they know how they feel when somebody keep coming to them. Yeah. Like it ain't gonna be reciprocity if I keep showing up because I'm never gonna ask you to show up or you, you are the big fish.


It ain't even about, it ain't even about the reciprocity. It's just about, I don't know. You just get tired of getting called on all the time and knowing you have to show up for. But then what if somebody like you or Joe, excuse me, have they hog up all the questions? Yeah. What? Yeah, you hogging already. Go ahead. What? What if somebody like you or Joe who has everything they can ask for, right? I'm not, I'm just being facetious with you, but how can a person show up for you in their mind? What would they think? Like how can I show up for this person? There's mad ways. There's a lot of ways. Yeah. But a lot of people are intimidated by that. No, we had a conversation about gift giving. Thoughtfulness. Yeah. He Don't care about thoughtfulness. That's him. You, I'm just giving, He does Care about thought. We had a conversation about gift giving and it was yo, somebody that could afford every gift.


How do you give them good gifts? And we said thoughtful gifts that you think about. I think it's the same shit. Somebody that got everything don't necessarily got everything you're talking about in the material set. Nigga. You're cranky when I call nigga, you don't really talk about what you're going through. You probably have all the money in the world that you need. You don't need it. It's nothing like how would a person be able to show for this person? Somebody can send you a DM or send you a text message that say, yo, I'm thinking about you. You might be going through ah, ah, and sometimes that shit could hit you. It could be a littlest shit in the world. Yo. Some, some more shit. I'm going to a show. You wanna come with me? I I'm going out to eat. I'm dinner's on me. Got it. I wanna come over here and bring some food. Hey, I'm gonna show up with some weed. Whatever. Like little shit. Sometimes it'll be like, yo, and We'll have the entire list on Minute Show explained it to Flip coming, coming to your YouTube really, really soon.


To add to what he's saying though, maybe the, the show up list is too long. Yeah. Sometimes you gotta slim, you gotta start slimming your shit. How Many people are on that list that you're showing up for double digits at Our age? You gotta start slimming that shit down. Close to double digits. Yeah. Freeze bro. I think it's just a part of being you exhausted and digit. You're wearing yourself out. Freeze. I think it comes, that's why I just try to show up financially and be done. It's the easy Right. I mean that's why It is a lot. It save you a lot in time. Yeah, I think It is easy. See I do it in time. That's the problem. Because you might not have the money to do it financially for double digit people. Not no disrespect. No, no, no. I don't take that but, but disrespect. Nah. But he might just can't do it for everybody.


But when you got, they not calling. See the problem is for me, they not calling for money. They're calling for Tom. I hear you. People need, yo, I need you to come over here and I need your assistance to come over and do this. And I'm like, you too here. You got to me too old. I got a family bro. I ain't trying to come over there. I Oh wait. These people are not family? No, these people are family. Oh, but they say he has his family in the house. No, no, no, no, no, no. I was about to have a whole nother angle on this. No, he said he has family at home. Got it, got it, got it. Yeah. Yeah. I got family. You gotta just be there for your girl and that and your family. Family. I see what you're saying. I got it. I think that shape come with the territory. It does. I think it's just part of being a man and that come with the territory unfortunately.


And if you abuse me on, on, on the show up tip, then I'm done. Yeah. Because now, but now I get You got an excuse not to show up. Oh, I say no without an excuse. I don't need an excuse. I'm not. No. Here's why. Just no. You know why. No. You know why just, no, that's it. Alright. Alright. Thank you. I just wanted to get, because I'm an adult And I said so I said no that should be the end of it. But whatever, just say I'm a dig so don't listen to me.

Okay. Yeah. Moving right along. Pap and Rem Joe, we can't avoid it anymore like pap and t Now take us out to group chat. Yeah man, there's a lot of things going on with Pap and M right now on social media. They're going back and forth. It is the first time we really see Pat pos use social media in the way he is apparently. No it's not. Well like that. I didn like this. It is, yeah. Like this. I didn't see, I didn't see Pat using it like don't be doing this well like this. Yeah. That's what we talking about. Okay. Yeah. I take it back. Yeah, It is, It is. Must be hard to be in the middle, isn't it? I love both of 'em as well.


It's not really ain't mind my business. I mind my business. Especially when it comes to domestic matters, right. When people are going through it with somebody married to got a kid with I I ain't none of my business. Y'all know me. I love Rim, I love Pap. Yes. I love 'em both. Same. I'm against all of this public internet shit. Same. I think it's all whack. I think it's all goofy and trash. Did I call either one of them to say that? No. No. Neither did I jump in the live stream. They both of 'em did. Yep. I did not. And did I fucking look at the phone with my girl and fuck shit Judge.


Get you go. Judge doesn't like judging with your girl yo. That's top tier. When, when people go through that shit on the internet, all that back and forth. Oh man. Yeah. Me and my girl. Yeah we into that. I wanted to take it off of Pap and Rim a little bit. Again. I'm not with none of that shit today Doing Yeah. At all. I wanna ask you, before you do that, you said, 'cause you're very close with art, with with Rim, right? Well I know you're close with both, but I I Well you ask him these questions, I'm pretty close with both. He, well you use, you can't, you can't use certain words like very close. He's talking, he, he become Mrs. Semantics when it comes to that.


What's very, are you very close to that? Yeah man, we got him. I, I love, I love them both. Okay. I love them both equally. Why would you not call, like I say that because if I saw any of y'all doing anything, I'm gonna pick up the phone and call you just yo dogs, you straight like, like sometimes people don't know what they doing. They caught in the moment. I had a family member that was doing something very similar. I picked the phone up. Yo bro, what's up? I think I'm closer to you than I am Pap remember? I was about to say it depending on that's what, that's why I, I think there's, I think there's a call during turmoil Closeness that has to exist for sure. Yeah. I don't know that I've established that with Pap and Rim and also the position that he's in.


Perfect answer. The position that, the position that he in. That's why it's very close though. Because when I, when I called when the first incident happened and I called Rim, you know she was making it seem like, or she said that, are you calling me to like get news or to be messy? You know sometimes that, and he's closer to them than I am but sometimes that line can get blurred when you just calling yo you okay, I'm just checking on you. And I had to repeat that and reiterate that I didn didn didn't talk about it. Right. So sometimes people get like that. I don't know about Joe but I know for me, like I know you said when Tiana and Shun Yeah. You got on the phone. Yeah but I'm closer. I'm closer with them. That's, I didn't know the level I can call Tiana. What I meant then, then there was also an expectation, Tiana was also expecting me to come in and talk about the, the nasty shit that I was seeing.


And she said Yo, you can't really keep this quiet 'cause you know it's foul. Got it. So when you call and you gotta call at the right time because then she put me on the spot. Okay. Yeah. I definitely think it depends on the relationship that you have with the people. Yeah definitely. Some niggas will be like, nigga get off my phone. Who the fuck are you? But they look at you with some certain nce and some big bullshit. Then they'd be more inclined to listen to you like Yo dog, you know I'm calling you from a place of love. You bugging the fuck out publicly. Right. You know what I'm saying? Or it ain't, I don't like it because they have been the symbol of of black love for a while and marriage and yeah all doing everything.


Right. When when I was on love and hip hop going through it, whatever I was going through, pap was in my face talking all that fucking preacher, preacher, Mr. Healthy man stay, stick it out, work it out. Love your partner. Your girl can do no wrong. It is bullshit I ain't want to hear. But that was the brand so I get it. So to see them two go through this, it's unfortunate. Especially with they story. Right. Like I'm hearing Pat go down memory lane with the yard. I brought 31 pounds of food to the jail a week. I was dead, yada yada. Like he, they going down memory lane so And they a legend a lot of shit. They are.


Yeah they are. Yeah It is t It is a lot of laundry. D ooh it's T. It is T. Really? They legend a lot of shit. Yeah they they throwing some shit out there. See that's unfor. She called that nigga fucking pa pus. Yo. No camera Parks too. Don't do that. No, no. It is just, nah that's, she called that nigga Pa Pos said because he Pa She said that I didn't don't look at me. She said, she said because he pawned the jewelry some shit. Yeah he pawn her bracelets. I don't know that to be true. Yeah but even if It is like if you pawn the bracelets, could you gone through some shit? I don't, I also don't like when people are, this is a nigga that I don't like when niggas is married and go through.


Yeah. I I don't like to say if we was ever married at some point and you was my best friend and Kiki and ha ha then it should be a different way to go about there's an unspoken rule when you're married to somebody. I was about to say how you handle each other and I don't know them as well as you guys, but they both just seem super duper solid. Right. Both of them seem super duper duper solid And so in that you be like nah they not gonna take it here. They're not gonna take it there. They not going to disclose shit that was private. They gonna hold it down the two of them. Like that's what they seem like and this is shop there. Do you, do you think these people, do you think it's because that we are pre social media days? They are come from that. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. So that's why you handle that what I'm saying?


No, I just think that, I don't think that, I think that if you solid and you had a relationship with somebody and they meant something to you at some point in time, it's just shit that you might not disclose that was given to you in confidence. Mm. Pat said a lot too. He did. He did. He did. No, I I from what I heard, I heard that he said I wrote your rhymes like oh, Oh now you discredited me as Yeah man It is nasty bro. But again, hurt people hurt people. He said they trying to hurt each other was gay. You said you was gay. I've never, if you met Remy you just don't think oh you gay.


Like this is the first time anybody said this about Remy. Your husband is saying it. He said he caught you cheating most but this shit is nasty. It is nasty. I ain't repeat on, I ain't gonna repeat any more that they said. What I will say though is if y'all was in this position, how would you want your current partner to handle it? I wouldn't be in this position. Yeah. I hope to never be in this position. How would I want my, if my Don't feed it? You say the current partner as in the person you're moving on with? Yes. Like Larrea and Duke. Easy actually that's, It is easy to say stay out of it but you kinda might want them them you Say nothing about how that nigga move in this You you might kinda want them to have your back.


At least I don give fuck Publicly. No I can't. I can't hear you. You're mumbling again. Is he? I can't hear. I'm just saying, I'm not saying his name. I ain't fuck with none of that shit is he? I'm with Pap on Sha don't shake somebody's hand and fuck your wife. I agree. I'm still with that and and I was more and I felt when and go clout Chase and put me all in your battles and all of this shit. I'm not with none of that easy shit and I'm talking from the position of somebody that loves Rim and Pat I got you. And I felt when Pat said like yo, something that stuck out to me, he was like, I kind of was concerned thinking that he's blackmailing her 'cause she's acting different and he played some audio of him saying that he has videos and tapes and it would come out whenever he wants it to come out. So Pat was like, I called some people behind the scenes like yo check on Rim and make sure that Duke, that she's in this situation willingly and not in it like she's forced because It is blackmailing her because he played a audio of easy saying yo s not your business no more.


It's not your business. That's no more. No, no, no. That's not true. No, no it's not your business no more. Wait, if if if it's a new pap, it's not your business no more. It's not your business fast Business how They're still married and that's my child's mother. They're still married If they're separated and sleeping in separate beds like they both claim. Yeah cool. All Peppo don't really claim that. But if they separated and sleeping still in the same room though separate beds, the beds still in the same I don care about About the, we cannot sit up here as we usually do and say that marriage is a business agreement and then go say it's not their business. If I am still married to this person, legally It is my business. I don't care about the business, I don't care about none of that part. The business could get the fuck outta here. I have a double digit year relationship with this person.


Of course I got love this. I still love this person. We may be going through whatever what we going through, but her best interest and her wellbeing are still paramount to me. Alright. That's manipulative and controlling. No it's not because I think it's total, I think it's the total opposite the conversation. I think it's the total opposite because Rim, I'm not, I don't know that she's saying this. I'm just using it because we in this example Yeah, rim is saying It is, it's over. We are done sign, it's sign the papers. I'm not your business. Come pick up your clothes. I packaged them neatly in this corner right here. Kick rocks. I'm, I'm with a nigga. Right. Got that you punched in the face. Got you. And I ain't really feeling that. Got you Michael. But then if you hearing that answer the question if you hearing it wife, we ain't even gotta talk about them any if if somebody's getting over.


It's not on on any one of our child's mothers that we not with. How is it our business? It depends on the level of relationship that you have with that person. Stop it. Let me answer that ass the same way you just answered bro. If I have a 10, 12 year relationship, 15 year relationship with one of your exes that y'all, you still love the person you want what's best for the person, especially if they're your child's mother, you still want what's best for the person. So anything that affects them affects your kid. You want what's best for someone is not enough. Let, lemme me the other person has to receive it. Let me finish. You could want the best for somebody on. It's not true. We know a nigga in jail now that's not true yo. They don't have to receive it. I could still want the best for them without them receiving it.


And if I start calling the police and treating this like what It is, then you gonna be jammed up talking about I love you and I want the best for you. So hold on, stop. I don't understand what you're saying. Hold on. You said saying it's manipulative. Where's manipulative on the other person? Because the person you saying I love you and I want your best interest is saying you're do so you trying to say that he should if you take it upon yourself now to continue the behaviors of wanting the best for this person without it being it's on you. Yeah. The true that, that don't mean I'm manipulating the person. Yo. We've love it's controlling not manipulative. Listen. And I don don't think it's controlling either. Yo. We've loved somebody that we've seen going off the deep end and they saying, nigga fuck you and you still are doing things and moving behind closed doors.


Yo, I know he was running off at the mouth. Yo spear him. Yeah right. Yo, I know he was doing x, y, z Yo. That's why peoples look out for him. I know he bugging the fuck out. No, y'all would call your baby's mom and say yo, the new nigga you moving on with, watch yourself stop it. I don't know what y'all talking about. We wouldn't do that like that. So why y'all trying to sell me a bridge? But hold on but hold on. Y'all trying to sell me no bridge. I don if my children, if my children's mother, I don if my children's mother ask you maybe if my children's mother's on the verge of being blackmail nigga. I'm concerned. True. I'm concerned. I've done that shit with girlfriends fucking got tapes. He got tapes. This nigga's on audio saying he got tapes and pictures of you and that he can expose it at any time I'm concerned I'm gonna wanna do something because that's still my children's mother facts. Right.


Flips right. He is 100% right. And my children have to see this. I'm not, I'm not gonna argue it. I'm not gonna argue it 'cause so you just saying yo, you just saying the person should just mind their business. That's your route. Yo, you got yourself in it. I'm gonna mind my business. We are no longer together. Whatever come outta that come out that that's just stance. Fuck that. Yes. That's an interesting stance. Especially, especially when kids involved. Hell no. Absolutely. That's an interesting stance. No, not just that nigga. We got that a 20 year relationship. I I dog at some point I hear that you have to trust your child's mother and her decision making. You cannot police it. You can't parent it, you can't monitor it, you can't talk to them so they can make the best decision.


That's true. Gonna make told ass decision. And It is nothing you can do about it. If you are watching them get black here or something, you can sit there and try to make sure they, you can take the parent's mother out of it, my nigga. This was once my friend that I loved the shit out of for 20 years and I still care about their wellbeing. Right. We are not together no more. I still want you to go on and be prosperous dog sign the papers. If every time you do that and make that move, the the person on the other end is saying you'll sign these papers and get the fuck outta my face At some point. You gonna have to get the fuck outta their face. I'm, I'm agreeing with you. I think that they, I think pap is hurt. I think that both things hurt be true. I think they both hurt y'all. I think both things could be true. I think pap is more hurt. I don't, I don't know about that.


I don't, I I'm agreeing with you. I don think pap is more and again, I'm totally talking out my ass like I don't have a fact nowhere. I agree with you. I have not spoken to anybody but just listening to Pam's live stream versus her live stream, he seem more concerned. He getting into shit that yo dog, you, you don't have to tell us all, all the people she cheated with. Yeah. It's not, it's it's not relevant. It's immaterial. There's no point to that right now. If you getting into that and the other person is saying, I have your shit packed. Sign the fucking papers and get out my face. I think that ain't all other, that ain't all other person is saying though. They are both saying things to try to hurt each other. She's up here saying yo, he was the brokest nigga I've ever been with of everybody, of every man I've ever been with.


He's the brokest. She's a girl. I dog you can't, I'm speaking on what hurt you are doing. You can't do the girl. Both of them are hurt and are trying to hurt the other. The man has to hurt different than the girl. Sorry. That's my belief. I'm agreeing with y'all that the man should do. That's wrong. Look and that's why we can't call each other and say, yo my nigga I'm calling to tell you goodnight. Yeah. Don't call me that shit you just said that's man to man nigga goodnight. Just call you and say goodnight. No you can't. Ain't no fucking girl no can't call me and say goodnight. But the shit that you just said saying that men hurt differently than women. That's the bullshit. I said should they, shouldn't they be human beings? Yes they should. You are wrong. I disagree. Don't wrong. I have a different opinion. I've heard niggas call my phone three, four o'clock in the morning. There's no right and wrong. True, true, true, true, true. But nigga, I seen you hurt before.


I seen a bunch of my male friends hurt before. What we show in the public facing and what we show behind closed tours is two totally different things. You right, You right. Because men are not allowed to hurt in public like that. That is not really my point. And I agree with that. What I'm saying is you said they should hurt differently. I know, but that's open for interpretation. So let me explain what God ahead lemme spell if and you have seen me hurt before. I have. I'm I'm I'm not saying that as a shot my nigga. You about to play. It's not a shot. Yo. No dog. I'm king hurt. There's nobody. That's Jay. Jay you Jalen. Jaylen hurt. Yo Jalen hurts. Two weeks ago I cried because the host of Saturday Night Live during Mother's Day told like some sappy story in the front.


There was a nigga named the white actor We love her you something like, oh and my mom is in the audience and she used to take me to these clubs and dance. So right now I ask you Mother, please dance me boy up with storm watching man Night left. I've been doing all that shit. Got it. I'm just saying if after the breakup you hear me somebody I was with 10, 15 year, however long you hear me saying, yo, this fucking whole bitch just slutting that she ain't worth shit. She ain't, if you just hear me speaking about her, in a way you will be looked, you'll be looked at differently as a man. We gonna know you hurt and that's why you get it off a thousand percent. But how you are handling your hurt, you gonna be looked at different versus maybe It is sexist.


What what It is sexist nigga you S3 and ain't nobody look at you differently like a man. They talking about you gotta shut the fuck up. The fuck up. Ain't shit you bringing up the arts. You wrote it in the arts. You wrote it. I'm talking about in real life you went in the studio and recorded it. You coulda kept that inside. Inside it was. And niggas tried to keep you from putting it out. Why? Because a man shouldn't be doing that publicly.


Oh that one of the greatest cheating song he cooking. That's not the point. Cooking he cooking. If you're taking my arts and putting it in real life, which is my No, you took real life. You your real life. It different than you getting on a a live stream saying the shit that you said in a song. That's awesome. I think we're moving the conversation somewhere different. Neither one of them have a song out. Neither one of them have a song out. Yeah. Will. So that we could have that debate at some point. This nigga is You Right. Og You right. You right. Got you. We got you. No you you wrong Oog. But yeah listen, if the I'll repeat, I'll repeat. If the lady is asking for a divorce and you are still on the points that helped y'all to separate, it's gonna be looked at a different, like he even saying on end he's saying, yo, you cheated.


I took you back. Yes you cheated again. I took you back. We went to therapy. You cheated again. I went to therapy. Yeah. So you telling us you want her back. I disagree. No. What led to this? No, what I, what I think he's trying to do. Hear me out. I I don't know them so let's be clear. But oftentimes when people break up, the man bears the brunt of that. I think he's shifting the blame saying Yo, you were doing all of these things and I was a standup nigga in that and I took you back. I went to therapy, I did all this other shit and you still did other shit. See I don't think you ever get the vacation from being a standup nigga. Pap has been nothing but a standup nigga to our knowledge. Publicly. True. So now don't start not being that.


And I'm not saying that's happening 'cause I love him but don't appear any other way now that there's turmoil and divorce. And I think that's what he's doing. I think he's telling the world dog, I was a standup nigga through all this shit. I stood by you, I did all of these things and it plays out and looks away for him. Like yo damn. He was supportive. Oh he got cheated on mad times. Oh he went to therapy. Men don't be wanting to go to therapy. Oh damn. He's the good guy. He's the consummate good guy. I think that's what they, he's saying and I think pap look away posting a picture of homeboy with the yo could you believe, don't let me go read this shit. He already took it down. I bet. But and that is my point. That right there is my point.


He took it down. He posted something that he shouldn't have posted about somebody that he shouldn't have posted about. Put a caption that he shouldn't have put somebody that love him or he just came to his better senses, said Yo, this ain't how I should present. Yeah. The phone call, I just think that's what I'm trying to say. Hurt should present differently. Now to your point about the whole, she's saying yo, I don't care about none of that. Sign a divorce, sign a divorce, sign of divorce. And he hasn't done it. He also put up when he did finally sign a divorce and everything and wrote a caption with it and one of the things in there, 'cause he said she lied for an hour straight. But actions speak louder than words. You just caught me yesterday trying to get back with me. Should have did that either. I know we shouldn't have nasty.


Well wait, let's nasty. Hold on, hold on, hold on. It is nasty. It's nasty. But listen, let's say that is, let's say that happened. So let's say if it happened, you shouldn't say it happened. I'm not talking about the, I'm talking about the fact that he ain't signed the papers in so long. 'cause you saying it. All she's saying is, nigga you want my best interest, whatever, I don't want none of that. Sign the papers, sign the paper, sign the papers. But if she was behind closed doors calling him trying to get back, then there's more conversation happening than just sign the paper, sign the paper, sign the papers. Which would say why he might not have signed the papers. He just believe it on the public shit. Depending on, you know what, now I'm done. Done. You believe. You believe in double standard. You believe that the man should just, if you honorable, you should carry it like a man. Be who you are.


And that's true. KeepHer behind the scenes. Yeah. I let let the woman have to do, let the woman do what She not always exhibited that behavior. I stand in that I I understand what you're saying. I what a hundred percent I I get I agree with you women going do that. Yeah. Do what they I got you. We gotta do what they do. Like she calling him homeless. Yeah, she crazy. But this some honorable crazy, there's some honorable women bro. Like it took, it took Tiana a long time. Even make that it's just some honorable women that need to be highlighted that live off the code in the creed of I just want to handle this behind the scenes. Even in her case, even in Tiana's case, she tried to find with initials she did. So nobody would know who it was. She did. And dude went and was like, no, I want our names out there.


It is honorable, there's honorable humans on both sides. I just want to be careful with that because women deal with so much from niggas dad. True. However y'all choose to respond depending on what you dealing with. That's true. I understand. True. That's true. So we don't want compare pain. True, true, true, true, true. Absolutely understand. I respect that. I love Ram, I love pap. I I wish they would stop. They're still at it right now. Still it currently. Yeah. And that's what I got man. Yeah. I, yeah. The world does not need to know all this information at all. And like just because one do it, don't the other one don't gotta do it. Yeah. Like just but that's hard for people. It is.


Yo, that's a star right there. That's a star to the left. Nigga walked in here with the aura. Boy. That's a star. We up boy. We up boy we up. I see it. That's Ilu. I beening nigga whole time I been, I don that. I been him this whole time. I walked in with the, he's so stupid. Stupid for the, for the audience. My, my my girl's son is here. Yes. For years.

You stupid though. Praying Prayers. Prayers Personally? Yeah man. Prayer for real. Prayers for pap. Prayers for rem. Do y'all think that Clarissa shamma a business when you can fight? No, you don't have to when you get busy you don't gotta you don't gotta, when you get busy and on top you what you want.


If you gonna clap me, then you don't have to. If you get busy you can do what you want. If I know I can get busy, that's the part I don't like. I don't like it neither. But it's my new, my new girl gotta sit back. I agree. While I'm talking to 10, 15 years. Lemme ask you a question of history. I agree with you that I have a child with that. I was married, I I know you wanna stick up for me and yada yada yada. But the new girl might have to relax. Same with the new nigga. I ain't like that shit. Reia wasn't, wasn't I just Chilling all day yesterday. Here he go man. Yeah shut the fuck up nigga. Shut the fuck up. He did that. Yeah, we talking to Rib Joe. Where was I at? Where was I at on day yesterday? Here you go the back with me nigga.


He lucky I ain't no bad about before. He is crazy. Oh no. They been going crazy. I didn, I hate it all hate time long. I absolutely hate that. And then crib Remy don't even look right when she in his crib. Yeah, no she she like, she hopped on the stream talking. Yeah I'm holding it it down in front of that man. But she was at, I'm outta here man. What? What you mean She shower The old, the old remnants started coming back. The old REM was back. What you talking about Mad Nycha up in there. The true religions on. He said night. No, they told me that true religion came back in style. So can't say that.


Shout the true Yeah, true back man. Yeah. See I'm old. What do I do? Yeah, true, true. Did come back me the big, I don't know nothing about no style. That's you Me neither. They ain't listening to this podcast for style tips from Joe. He neither Crazy. That's funny. Yo, you stupid son. Bad NYCHA in there. I don't think the niggas should be in the background even involving himself. I think it sounds crazy. Kick Rob. Yeah I think it come on like even even like you doing too much coverage that we had the cri especially if he slept you already, he went crazy when he talking about the sleeping though. Yo, even the shit with RG three, I didn't know that that came to, to my attention that RG three was in the back talking and his girl was in the back.


Yeah. Adding in. I was like, Oh yeah. Oh yo. Bug nasty. Yeah. Chill out. More power to all thought and burst. Yeah. I'm glad my days of public feuding with someone I love are over with Jesus. Yeah. That's no to Yes because there's no way to tell your new partner to shut the fuck up in mind business if the other person says something to it's hard. Man, you bugging man. It's hard 'cause 'cause let me be clear. I don how did this start? I heard it started from an interview that shorty had on a, a thing. Well it depends on whose story you believe. They say that every time Clarissa open her mouth, she talking about re and Pat.


But I heard it wasn't negative. The I don't matter. Don't mention my name matters. It matters. No, it don't, don't talk about me on your interview. It, it matters. I don't think it matters bro. I think it matters. It don't matter. You could tell the interviewer a list of things you don't wanna talk about and you should have enough going on. If you don't have enough going on to not talk about me, then you shouldn't be doing an interview. Let me ask you this. If somebody says something positive, right? 'cause I, I didn't see it, but I heard that it wasn't nothing malicious. I heard she ain't say nothing bad. Cool. And if you are really over it, like you saying you over it, then the fact that somebody said your name but in a positive way and didn't say nothing malicious. If you really, really, really over it, you let that go.


No, not, not if, if you're not over it though, I might not like this person. They might not be over it. That's my point. That's my point though. There's nothing wrong. No, there's nothing wrong with not be over. But your whole stance was, nigga come get your shit. Sign these papers. I'm over you. But that could be that. And then also I don't fuck with shorty and don't ever say my name, nothing. Don't talk to me. We, we don't already had this before. So you don't ever say nothing to me. I won't say nothing to you. And one don't mean the other because It is justifying bullshit. Wait one don't mean the other. I'm not justifying it. Can I just say what I'm saying? Please. Because the woman is doing, going through the necessary course of action during breakup don't mean that she's not emotional doing it.


It just means she's dealing with the emotions and going through it. Any one of the girls that called me and say Hey you can keep, keep that shit. It is over and was actually carrying it like that. I still thought they was hurt. Remy could still be hurt but she going through it saying I want this to be a rap. Both of 'em are hurt bro. Both of 'em are hurt. Their actions are showing that they both hurt. 'cause when you don't really, when you really don't give a fuck, you don't do none of this. I do think the new party gotta shut the fuck up. Got it. On both sides. Got you. No matter if you saying something good or bad, don't let let the two people that was in the relationship deal with it. Without the extras, without the media coverage. Breakfast club enter nigga.

I just don't know if Adam Silver is picking your city to be. I just don't know. That's a real thing. Do you know the money that's gonna be made if the New York Knicks make the NBA finals at every level?

Knicks tickets. Very different ball game anyway man. See the fucking pace. I think that, I think that the Knicks, I mean not the Knicks, the NB are prepared the market both 'cause you can mark it small versus Versus small Mark. So was it rigged or no? Yeah, we were just talking about the rig of the draft and Shaq went and said something was Rigg that he asked him if he wanted to play where was warm or whatever it was. Is it rigged or nah. Who asked him that? He was in an interview and they said I think David Stern came up and said you wanna play somewhere War where? Oh yeah, well for the draft. And he got drafted to, he went to Orlando. He just happened. Just so happened TA Orlando won the first pick. Yeah.


Anyway. I do believe the draft to be somewhat tinkered with Mm mm I think the playoffs sometimes can tinkered with too. I think this shit is business at the end of the day. I think it's business for sure. Y'all, I'm gonna keep it. We don't wanna see no pacers. You don't want to hear this fucking Friday night. My nigga that game the other night, they fought through a lot of shit who it was and one's left and right. Oh they fought through a lot of shit to win that game. Like standard tickets 4 62.

The hand for some rea. Yeah man. So ice, how do you feel? Break it down for us. I don't feel no way. Unpack it. What does that unpack? Did a nose, did they do a good, made a big deal out of it because the internet likes making big deals outta shit. That don't mean sense. No, it made a big deal out of it because her nose was her thing. Her nose was like her thing like Rick Ross's beard. It was a thing. Yeah it was part of her like image. She used to put used to rap about it all the time. Okay. I, I don't, It is not a big deal to me.

I'm trying to do Definitely not get So do you think that anybody that gets plastic surgery, self-hatred? I think nose jobs specifically speak to it. I don't, I'm not against plastic surgery. I think a lot of black women that get nose jobs for them to have an issue with their old nose is because it was a black nose and they wanted to rid themselves of their black nose to be accepted in other spaces sometimes. What if they nose wasn't a black nose? Yeah.


Okay. I'm not talking what they have the other nose, the mixed nose. I ain't talking that person there. Then you just got a nose job. Gotcha. But nose jobs that I don't see a whole bunch.

But I don't see girls that go get nose jobs come back with like, you know in the barbershop there's like the picture of like the 20 different cuts. Yeah. Yeah. 20. Yeah I think in the at the nose job spot it ain't but like three noses you could get. They all come out with either one of three noses and they're all European. I don't ever see no black girl go in and come out with a different black girl nose. Now you just got a white girl nose. I don't think it self hatred.


I just think I don, I don't think, no I'm not saying it's about glow. I opened the convo up. Yeah I don, I'm not saying, I'm not saying it's about glow really. I just think today man people got the opportunity to fix whatever the Fuck that they got options. They don't like it don't necessarily gotta be self-hatred. I shit, I ain't like my teeth. I went and got Invisalign. It's not self-hatred I think. I think and and you are in the public spotlight now. You was cool with your nose. You stop fixing after teeth. Yes nigga my nose that day.
