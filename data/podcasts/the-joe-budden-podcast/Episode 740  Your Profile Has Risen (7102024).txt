And reminding your profile, Chris. True. Where would you guys like to Truly Begin?


Begin? Anybody see any other recap from our Essence Festival over the weekend, new Orleans, everywhere. You have any thoughts on anything? The Talk What? What's the talk? The talk of the Hot Boy reunion at that Yes. Hot Boy reunion. That was not the Hot Boy reunion. It wasn't the Hot Boy reunion. Why Baby Manny? Fresh BG and Juvenile performed together. Turk wasn't there. Turk said something about the business not right. But the real thing was once they left the stage, all of the cash money, shit was changed to Young Money and Wayne came out and did his set. Oh I I didn't know it happened like that. That's how it happened.


Oh. So Wayne did not perform with them And the word was that Wayne was like, if it ain't no Turk then it ain't no hot boy reunion. Which Is fair. Which is which is correct. Yeah. Which is fair. That's fire that he said that Some people stand on certain shit and still go out and still gonna do my sex. I'm gonna still do it. Yeah, I'm still gonna It is New Orleans. Yeah. Yeah. It's New Orleans. I I saw BG comment on that. Turk did something last year. He know what he did last year that he wasn't here but I don don don't Know. See don don't know what he did. I I don don't know what he did. Well I certainly caught Turk responding. Okay. Oh see That? Here we go. Let me give it to you.


You Nigga. You niggas want that shit to come together. 'cause you niggas fucked up out here nigga. I ain't fucked up out here nigga. Nigga, I'm blessed nigga in highly favor nigga. By God. Hey Me too nigga. Y'all got me fucked up man. To clear the record on that man nigga, I say fuck a hot boy to a nigga and that come from me before I let a nigga disrespect me, homie. I don't know what he is referring to. Hey Nigga. Disrespect won't be tolerated nigga. Your ain't no ain't no big eye no lil use over me man. BG better sit this motherfucking ass down somewhere man. That nigga don't run shit around here.


Not with me. He might run that shit with you niggas man. He don't run that shit with me man. He ain't doing nothing but running this motherfucking mouth. You guys get the gist. don don't want to continue To play. The important part about that though is him saying like, I ain't gotta take the, I'm not fucked up. I don't gotta take the shorts. you know, you hear situations where people, you know you had somebody up here before that was on tour. True. Yeah. And you, you start to think maybe you're doing that because your situation ain't necessarily, I remember when when Puff did the tour and everybody was on that tour and they were still kicking his back out three months later. It's like Yo fa why was you on that tour if you shitting on a nigga? We needed that, whatever that scratch was at that particular point in time, they needed it.


And so you gotta succumb to the, to the salute, the every, all parties involved. But I, I get what he's saying. I ain't need the money. I ain't have to do that. Yeah. I, I like standing on, on on whatever respect side he has. I respect Yo. I'm not budging for whatever y'all offering. don don't need that tour. don don't need that reunion. don don't need none of that hot boy shit. I'm good. Even if that meant modifying his life down. Ask your question to whatever he needed to do. He Straight, let me push, give you some pushback. Yeah. What about ranking in the hot boys? Meaning like, I remember TURs my man, but what if they said, nigga you ain't do that much When, you was part of the hot boys, so what we doing so Cool. Then y'all do.


If that's how y'all feel, then y'all like, I won't be there then. Yeah. Okay. But no matter what it is, I don't need y'all. Is is is the the moral, I mean the moral, I got it. That's the point of what he's saying. don don't need y'all. So, And as it turns out he has a really good relationship or I'm guessing with the person that did the most, which was Wayne. Yeah, Sounds Like it. So if you got Wayne saying, good point. If it ain't no Turk, then it ain't no me. Good point. Even if Wayne means something different, even if Wayne mean nigga, I'm really off that we don't know. But if you didn't get it good with Turk, you don't got it good with Wayne. I feel, I feel the stance because it's the same thing Royce told niggas about me. So. I mean I can't, Hey, if Joe ain't there and that ain't slaughterhouse.


It could be something else, but it just ain't that So I feel the stance. And we know Wayne to move like that though. Like if, if, if, let's say him and Turk do have that relationship. If you not right with him, you ain't getting me. If you not treating all Wayne people, like with the respect that you handle Wayne with, I learned that too with them some gutter gutter shit. That's dope. But that's dope. Yeah. Then then he's riding, he's riding like that. Yep. Admirable. That's super solid. It's admirable. Yeah. You gotta love that. Yeah, you gotta love that. I have absolutely nothing bad to say. Now I also think that a big timers juvenile and BG set is flames. It is, It is. They got Enough. I'm not one of the people that feel like they need a hot boy reunion.


Them niggas could go up there with they own shit and be perfectly Fine. Yeah, they could. Yeah. There's enough good music over there down Now they in New Orleans, ed and Fest where that have been some fly shit to see. Absolutely. I'm sure. But Especially now that B G's home, like they've done, I don't wanna call it, they, they've had hot, hot boy reunions in the past without bg. Right. 'cause he was locked up, you know what I'm saying? They've done Wayne's Festival, Louisiana. He's had one of the headliners have been Hot Boys reunion. So you, you've done these type of things, but it wasn't the full hot boys. Got you. So it would've been great to see all of them together. Now that bgs home.


But again, that's some behind, you know, behind the scenes shit. Yeah. Shouts to all of them, man. Hopefully they can get right in real life. So at some point You can see a hot boy reunion word that, that's what I got for you on that real shit. I, I also had a really different point of view on the Busta Rhymes Essence Fest clips that went out from his performance. He was clipped up trying to gather people to the front of the stage or to get people off of their feet and out of the seats, Off their phones, off their Phones, off of their phone. Be in the moment Enjoy the show. He said, I don't come from this cell phone era. Fuck these phones. Let's have a good time. This is my first time in New Orleans celebrating 30 years of Essence Festival. Whatever the speech was, He was getting killed for that.


The, when it, when it, you know, the way it was clipped up, the way it was clipped up, the captions in the headlines made it seem like Busta Rhymes was angry. Like old head Type shit. Shit. Like he was spazzing over the lack of people showing up for support. And I didn't get that from watching his clip at off. You're Entertainer on the stage. It's your job to get the crowd involved. Yeah. That's what he did is part of what makes him one of the greatest performers of all time. For sure. And he got high energy music. So I want the crowd up and you know what I'm saying, like it ain't sleepy time music that Bustas doing at All. And if I got a crowd where I need to highlight certain people just to get 'em to stand up and enjoy this set, pastor Cavalier don't hit the same sitting down.


Exactly. That's the point. Yeah. None of that shit. None of his, None of it. None of His music. Yeah. So I had a different, a different different view on that. Like The, the same thing happened. When I was at the Jeezy show a week ago right before Jeezy came out. The, the, the DJ that was announcing him. He was like, Yo, everybody in this seats get up, get up. I want everybody to come to the front, like come out this seats getting crowd the aisles. We don't care. Come to the front. Like that's, and this is the social media era. So depending on the way a venue looks, they wanna pull everybody together to make a crowd look bigger than necessarily, you know. Gotcha. For sure they do. They do that too. The camera people and all that other shit gonna, it look like you was a packed, they're sitting, they're saying everybody come here, they're gonna get shots a certain way and it's gonna Look like you rock smoke.


Every aspect of what we talking about on her tour directly next to the stage are reserved for gag City Super fans. Fans. My number fans, my number one super fan fans. So when that camera pen, you gonna see what it looked like and fucking Nicky's that that dj that that DJ in between sets had that building Absolutely on fire. Hmm. Same as Chris Brown shit. Yeah. Same as Chris Brown. Shit, shit the same in Kendrick pop out shit until Stan came on. But I know he was doing something. Yeah, he was doing something. He was doing something. Yeah. So I. I understand. And That wasn't the DJ I think that was just house music for What it's worth. Got it. Got it, got it, got it. Yeah. DJ might not have played Stan in that. I mean maybe there was a DJ playing So I Don wanna disrespect him, but it wasn't like a active DJ set.


You could see him over there rocking. It was just like house music vibes. Got It. Got it. Yeah. It's just Concert 1 0 1. I don't see, there's nothing to kill em for that. Like, have you ever been to a concert? They want you to be active to Participate. Yeah. Yeah. I get it. I don't want it, it, it is easier if, especially if you got music that I'm jumping and doing all of this with junk. Yeah. I mean the more fun for me was watching all of the tweets and Instagram posts from the aunties, the black aunties that was saying, Hey, essence Fest used to be for us. There's a lot of nieces, a lot of nieces down here running around. I enjoyed that part the most.


Shout out to everybody that went to Essence Fest. I would've went, I would've went just for the TGT reunion that I still haven't heard of Peep about So I didn't see any coverage on that. So I had my review on it. Yeah. And I just need a TGT album anyway. What else? What else, what else? Oh, you said you, you mentioned Aunties that there's a new show. Oh yeah. we on bullshit today. We're on bullshit. You giving a take? I I can only give a take based on the, the clips that everybody else has seen. 'cause I don't say Let, that's all we need. Yeah. Let me, let me, so the show is called Aunt T like the word Aunt word t It's Tia Kemp Is, which is Rick Ross's baby mother.


Because these listeners ain't going know who the fuck these people are. Maybe I was just About talk. Yeah, it it's Tokyo Tony. Who is black? China's Angela White. Angela White. There you go. Fix it up. I fixed Angela White's mom and the young lady, I'm sorry, I always mispronounce her name, but she's Blue Face's mom. Okay. So those are the three hosts of the show. Okay. the show is on Zeus. It's called Auntie. Got It. And their first guest was the game. I saw that. Yeah. And the episode just came out. And there's a lot of conversation about this episode. Fuck my daughter. I want to this, it's a blessing. This the introduction.

Oh, whoa. What the fuck? What? Cracking that pepper. Okay, so gang, we wanna know, and I'll tell you right now, this motherfucking show going, this's gonna be all right. Do people, people wanna know gang And the after show people First man Pusy another man. Put your pussy up, girl.


Hey, put your pussy up. That's Have me dying. Well, no. Okay, first of all, whenever it has anything to do with people who have vaginas and they're doing something, why is it always, why is the my reaction the first one that we go to? Well, like, because I'm No, no, it it's a little sexist. It's a little sexist. Come on now. Okay. Because we can all have an opinion about the shit that we just heard and has nothing to do with having vaginas. Can I, can I 'cause being that I was the one that said Mel. Yes. So allow me to answer please. The previous topic. You were the one that didn't say anything. So I was letting you start this topic with a response.


That's why That's, that's why, that's why I start with you too. 'cause we're at minute 55. Oh, shut up When. you said a total of two words and you're paid. Yeah. That was the only reason why I didn't, nothing. Doesn't Matter. Sorry for trying to throw the ball to your, your way. you know, try to find some, trying to swing it on find. Don't Worry about, I'm gonna finish you on the balcony later. Try find some feminist, Some feminist angle to get. And you got a vagina. This has nothing to do with having a vagina. But you have one. I do, I do. I Didn can say the two related. Yeah. Is the two things are unrelated. I don't know if I'm going on a popular on a, on a broadcast talking about my daughter's fellatio skills with a man who has apparently like been there with I, this was so cringe to me and I was like, maybe I'm just, I'm aged out of this situation because this was nauseating to listen to.


I could hear that lines down. I can hear it now. They be back. Oh man. You, can you take this all the time? This time I go on the ledge with her. I guess this time. Get your shit off. I just did. Yeah. And so you feel like they shouldn't, A mother should not be talking discussing her daughter with a man that had sex with her. Yes. How comfortable would you be ha talking to another man about I'm a Having sex with You're a parent. You're a parent. So. I. Let's, let's take it off. Let's take it off mother and father, let's talk about just it being a parent. Let's Make it up as unfun as we can. No, That's all. Don't do it. I wanna hear. Yeah, No, I mean, you, you ask the question.


You guys can crack all the jokes that you want. No, Ask me the Question. Okay. Yeah. But, okay. So you're a parent. Would you be able to have a conversation about your daughter's, you know, sexual prowess and Well, let's make It fair, son. Son. Yeah. Fair. Because my daughter's 15, so that'd be pedophilia. I don't think I, I would have that Conversation. Let's just say your daughter was of age. I can't imagine that yet. Jr's of age 19. Would I have a conversation? No, not, I'll have a conversation with him, but not with the girl. It wouldn't feel to me. But if he, they're having a conversation in front of me, I'll see what JR is talking about. I I will focus on JR. 'cause you have to be mindful speaking to young adults, especially if they're young women. So you have to be mindful. But JR Jr have a conversation with me in front of his girl about sex.


I will engage with my son. Yes, princess. I can't think about anything like that. No. Got it. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. But I wouldn't talk to the young lady if you asking me that. No, that's not my child. And, and I, I can't imagine me talking to my daughter about, or anybody or a man about my daughter. No, I wouldn't do that. No. Okay. This is the part where if I jump in right now, the fans are going to blame me. Go ahead. They're gonna say, Joe, you're stopping a really great serious talk that we wanted to hear. No, go ahead. Nah, you, you're, I really wanna hear, I really wanna hear What you saying. I wish y'all two would shut the fuck up. And I've been feeling that way for at least seven minutes.


This Is what I'll say in trying to stay with y'all. I'll try to stay where you're at. Mel. What are your thoughts? Just try to imagine, right? What are your thoughts in terms of being the hot mother type, right? Because you would be a hot mom. Yeah. So if you had a daughter that's 26 and she's bringing her dating her dating fucking experiences to the house, you would just carry it differently is what I'm getting from you than what Tokyo Tony is doing. Like how cognizant would you be of the fact that Yo, I am a milf, not I'm being, trying to be Respectful.


Yes. That's what I'm saying. I would be very cognizant of that fact. Like not wearing certain things around your daughter's company. Yeah. But that's just how I am naturally anyways. Mm. you know, like I've always had to be cognizant about that around my girlfriend's boyfriends because it's, it would be very easily thought that if I was wearing something that, that was intentional. So I've always been very cognizant of that. So That would be, you know, I, I couldn't see, you know, the way that I think changing. Okay. But I mean, I don't know. I've just, I al I also find it cringe whenever guys just get up on podcasts and just start pillow talking as well. Like, that to me is extremely cringey.


you know, and it's like this, What if the producer of the podcast is kind of seeking that out? They probably are. And, and that's where it's just like, eh, well so then what is there really to talk about if you know the behind the scenes, but most people don't really know that that might be what's going on behind the scenes. Well in this, in this particular instance though, like again, what he played game wasn't even on the stage yet. That was how she introduced him. This black ass nigga coming out fucked my Daughter. I got more. That was the intro Crazy Motherfucker. This is the best thing could have happened to me tonight. I Bet. You ready? I'm telling you. Y'all Alright, lemme ask you a question. Y'all Got the right run Tonight. Can you explain this Dick pic? What? Dick pic? I was sent a dick pic today. And. it supposed to been you, It supposed to been, you know that was me and my dick.


You playing fo lady? Is it six Five? You wanna take five or something? I'll it I'll take one for the team. Knock that cowboy way. Let see you White mom that she want For the team. Let them see They dead ass. No. Yeah, they, they not playing there. Lady Gremlin Yo Right one today, Tokyo. Nah, they was wild. I I want to throw some more into this pot because day serious bullshit is pissing me off. But I'm so great at Podding that I'm gonna play along. Come on. Stop it. What do you say to, and I'm now I'm speaking from somewhat experienced.


What do you say to the competitive nature that exists sometimes between mother and daughter relationships? That's the thing. That is definitely thing. It is the thing. Yo you, you speaking from experience or not? Yeah. Really? I've had I told you that that before. I told you before that that shorty was trying to pop me with Her daughter. Oh That's just, see that just says y'all both on some fun shit. But if you on some psychological shit, I've had a different, if you on some psychological shit sometimes that competitive shit. Hey, the mom was you 30, 40 years ago. She still even 30.


Even 30. Oh, I know. I know. I'm being, I'm being, I'm being gracious. I'm being gracious. She still feel like She's her. She's Her. And now, now your little last that came out, my pussy is out here bringing some niggas. That's my speed through the house. And that's old enough to get it done for me. 'cause your little last hot ass like older men. So now you in that little threshold, Bro. I now you in that little intersection. I forget it then I'm had No, It's a real thing. I'm an experience where I was the exact same age difference from the mother and the daughter. Like the mom. The mom had me by a certain, I think it was like six and then I had the daughter by six years. So we, it was like right in the gap.


Right. The mom had a problem like getting dude, like getting a, keeping a dude. But me and the daughter was together for a while. So mom started to get jealous of I we, her daughter could see it that her mom would get jealous of the type of nigga she had that I was around and she didn't have that So I know exactly. There was, there's some competition between Mother Yo, Hey bleep this. I'm on me. What You hot baby come, I'm cooking tonight. I fly you over here to Mississippi. Like Some niggas.


Well isn't that like an ultimate fantasy for you guys? Exactly. To like do the mom and the daughter? No, Some niggas take down the mom and the daughter. I know niggas that took down the mom and the daughter For me. No. No. That wasn't My, have you guys ever had mom daughter combos? No. It's not something I want. No. Okay. You might not be something you seek out, but you're also not kicking them both outta bed if they're both hot. Right. They, I'm never getting them both in my bed. They're never gonna make it to My bad. That's A weird thing. Okay. Really? Yeah. Yes. I've heard plenty of guys talk about how That would be like the pinnacle top of the mountain type shit. That's some Weird Sisters. Yeah. Twins. Yeah. Twins. Not mama and daughter Even. That's, But Mel's been around like different groups of people. So I mean, I came in and told, I came in and told the story about how somebody I used to deal with, they daughter was trying to holler at me and she's drop dead gorgeous.


And I was fuck like Yo. Come on though. Yeah, you did. Yeah. Like I Come on my nigga like, nah, I'm good. Like I know some niggas that smashed the mom and the daughter. I, I believe it. I believe it. Everybody, everybody at the same time is where it's a little weird. Okay. Definitely. It's All a little bit weird. But I think it's weird. Even it's, even if it's men be doing shit just for the thrill, just To be able to say they can do it. Y'all Put it in her ear Yo, like, you know what I'm saying? This is feel some bullshit. Want her to hear where I was coming from. Nah. Well yes to that. That's true. you Know what I'm saying? Like, But sometimes you was fucking this daughter because she looked great and then she take you home and now, now you see where the fuck she got it from. True. Yeah. And then the mom is, Is crushed And mom on it.


Mom Killing the daughter. Killing the daughter. Extra friendly. Doing way more than He was down 46. Yeah. Cooking For you back to them ages and them sweet spots. No back to, but we can't ever do a part where we tell the truth. Truth. Exactly. Yeah. I just had to add off of that perspective before Mel got all super bougie. No, I'm, I'm not super bougie. I've seen, I've seen relationships between moms and daughters where there was a high level of competition. I thought the shit was weird as fuck. I just, I didn't grow up though with that personal experience. you know? Like my mom was, my mom was my mom. Your mom was and she act and she acted like a mom. Your Mom was married. Well until my father died.


But then my mom never remarried. I'm just saying that My mom. Yeah. But having that, that match, My mom had an active dating life. But you know, like there was no, there was no weirdness. Like my life was my life. I think it's more prevalent than we know. I think that that competition is real. I think that the small window between the ages now is different. That's the true. And then I think like, so if your, if your daughter is 26 Yo, your mother could really be 42. So now you bring home a nigga that's 34, 35 Bernice's daughter is on TV saying, when a guy courts me, I check his dms. I and I go from my mom's DM to see, see if he's, if he's ever hollered at my mom.


'cause I'm not into that. And my mom may have a thing for younger men, but she says that on tv. So I Just don't think the dynamic is Nah, it's as, It's not. It's weird. Yeah, Yeah. I don't, I don't. And these young money getting niggas that's 34, 35, they fucking the hot forties And the hot 20 something. Hey, there you go. Go. There you go. That's yeah. Yeah. They outside. Sorry, Outside boys. Ball player niggas is dunking a mother and daughter. How Did you feel about the game shit though, Joe? How did you feel about it? Did you, were you entertained by it? Did you think it was funny? I think the game is funny if he in the room by himself. Yes. Yeah. Game's fine. The game is funny to me.


Hilarious. So I. See the thinking from the producer. Oh yeah. That's What I, I saw And. It works. And to is' point, once I saw the names, I knew what I knew what this was going be and they, they started him on bullshit. I think if, if they would've came in and had a respectful conversation, he might've been respectful. But y'all brought me in here on bullshit time from Go. We didn't bring them together. I believe him for a respectful time as a producer. That's what I'm saying. The three names that they have hosting this show tells me we want Bullshit. Check the show out if you are interested in it. Now I Do want to ask y'all one other thing about the show. There's another clip where I saw that Tia gives game a lap dance knowing Game Ross.


Well she don't care about that. I don't think, Ross, I'm just, I'm just asking. Don't think I don Ross and t even She gonna be besties with any one of his ops for the rest of, that's her bag for the, for the rest of fraternity. For the rest of fraternity. And the producers love it. Oh of course the producers gonna eat it up. What else? What else we got? Get get all the goofy shit out the way. Hey Yo real quick. This is not goofy, but the, the wheelchair killer, they beat his ass in the city the other day. This Is the story I was telling you guys about. They beat his ass. So you know there's this young lady was found murdered and her body was found in a sleeping bag and the cops went and arrested this guy.


It describes it as Manhattan but I mean it could be like Harlem or something like that. Got it. Okay. And they, the cops found him 28th. Yeah, exactly. Guy in a wheelchair. So they started bringing him out because they found footage of him in his wheelchair's electric wheelchair chair dragging the, the sleeping bag to the place where it was found. And so when the cops brought him outside a mob had, you know, kind of She's right. didn didn't wanna make it. I didn't wanna make it that. That's exactly What. Happened. I want to say how the people whooped his ass. Yeah they did. They whooped his ass. They tried to drag him. They were slapping him beside his head. The mother. I like that. I like that type of street social justice. We need to bring more of that back. It's only one problem with that.


Well what's the problem? They don't know that he committed that crime. I was just Getting ready to say what if he's not, What if he ain't do it? They have him on video dragging the body to the place that they found the body. That does not mean that he committed that crime. So What? He was just cleaning the garbage. I'm not speaking for him. It just, I mean what, What would be the Other, I'm not speaking for him. Y y'all, the murder Doc killed people. So he might be right That that does not prove that he killed that young lady is all I'm saying. And I'm not saying he didn't And but the mother was Into your street justice point. Right. What. Happened when his mistaken identity. But we just gotta deal with it at that time. Street Justice is without due diligence sometimes, right? Yeah. Like sometimes it's dictionary. You get those few episodes of law and order where the parent seen who you thought was the suspect.


So now they waiting in the precinct and they shoot him or and this person was innocent. You just, you do need due diligence. Whatever justice is happening. Yeah you do. True. They rest in peace to the girl. Yasmine. Yeah. Rest against horrible way to go. Gunshot. Gunshot holes to the head. Horrible, horrible way to go. I would've never brought this in the B block. You niggas are fucking y'all on a roll and they call you call y'all butter. Hey, before you get to that shit we wrote down in pre-production on the board this murder. But hey I'm with it. Hey y'all The murder niggas. Yeah but I'm real murder on tv. Don't start showing me on the news. The murder that's three hours fresh Right over there too.


Yeah. Right, right, right there. And And, it showed the footage of him niggas in the projects being beating his ass and as he came out they trying to kick him in the legs. Like Don came out with the cops. We don't they him on Un Stretch stretch him And the cops let him beat him. No, they To stop. They tried. You can do. There Was a mob man. There was a mob. Nothing You can do. There's a lot of people out there. There was a lot of, he caught to three good snuffs to the face. He he took it. He took, he caught three good wounds though. Rest of them was fucking kicking his legs and she ate them. She don't feel none of that. He swinging. I know wrong. No, not my, He can't feel shit. I should watch some of this shit rest in peace to the young lady.


You Right. I saw That would because When you all, when a lot of people swinging at once, you not going hit him. So the the niggas That would, they couldn't get to the front. They was trying to beat his legs. He didn't feel nothing. Yeah he was talking to The police. One nigga got through because the cop had him. Like dude, one nigga got through clean jab bow Right through. Oh shit. Alright. Speaking of jabs, speaking of jabs, okay. I also watched the Shakur Stevenson fight this weekend. I Did Little Bonnie, thanks for your sight Recommendation. I am going to, y'all still up to that shit y'all, That shit be coming through. It came through. I watched the Shakur Stevenson fight and I watched a bunch of other fights. Right by mistake. 'cause I Woke up.


Everybody was talking about the Shakur fight the immediately turned to No no I turned to 1,001, which is the pay-per-view. Shit. Thinking that that's that the fight. But that was Nate Diaz and homeboy that he fought and that under car was lit. So they start showing me some 18-year-old kid that Floyd has that's three and old. They showing him in the back. He a killer back there. I'm like Shaki about to fight this three and old nigga that don't make sense. So I turn to ES espn. Somebody find, tell me it's on ESPN So I turn espn. I catch a little bit of the undercards and then the Shakur fight and I watched at least 10 rounds of this before it was enough for me.


Now I'm gonna watch how I talk 'cause Shakur is big Jersey and if he could say that shit to Mace, he could say it a million times to Joe. But, but my question was gonna be is Sha sha Shaki Stevenson Shakur Shakur Stevenson box office? No, that's my only question. I don't I watched the fight. Some of the best defense ever. I could see why he don't get hit and I could see that he's clearly a superior boxer to a lot of people. I can see why people do not wanna box him. But I think to be at a certain level you need to be box office and that don't begin in the ring.


Like I think he's too mild-mannered or there's something about him just as a person that is not box office. Is it too early to put that on him? Like he maybe can grow into being more box office in terms of personality maybe. Yeah, maybe. I don't think that you grow into that. Yeah, I don't think so either. I think you either have that which attracts box office or you don't. And now you have to go alternate ways to get box office. Like he'll maybe get there because he's such a great boxer. He would need, he would need another, but he going to need that is and coming off of his last fight, this fight was important.


His last fight was a snooze fest and really bad reviews. Which some people say, well not even some people say that that alters how negotiations go for these contracts. Absolutely. Yeah, for sure. Absolutely. Thousand percent. So he needed to put up a big time showing he won clearly and easily but he didn't kill the dude. And I think that's what, where things are going wrong. What? That's why he's getting critiqued this way. 'cause he didn't kill the dude who you should easily kill. People feel like. So what's happening is he's being paired with Tank who is box office times a million Tank is knocking niggas out. So in boxing as fans, we don't want to see strategic boxing.


You wanna see a nigga get we It is a gladiator. It's gladiator. But we saw Floyd be a defensive boxer for Ramir Floyd antics With it. But in the beginning Floyd was knocking niggas out. That's true. That's true. Right. So Floyd earned all of that and then at at one point, even with Floyd being such a great defensive fighter, he was still beating you up. But The other thing was the other thing before wanted to see him lose. I was Just getting ready To say there was that point in where people was like, Yo, these Floyd fights are boring. Yeah, yeah. But it was 900 of us in some stranger's living room in Hackensack because everybody thought packed up watching and Everybody this gonna be the one. Yeah. We sold betting and all of that might be the One to get 'em. Shakur gotta get through that. Yes. And that might be a little more difficult in this era.


Mm yeah. No just instant gratification right now. Just and he has a, he has an unfortunate thing of being compared to Tank. Tank is putting niggas through the ropes bro. And Tank is wordy. He funny, he charismatic. You get what I'm saying Like tank to Box office. Devin Haney, I told you you gonna get hit with that same fucking left jab. I hit your dumb ass wit when we were sparring. He hit you with the same left jab all night. He's funny. Yeah, SHA ain't got And the thing is, the thing is, when after you watching Devin Hanney fight, after people are watching these Shakur fights after you watch a people are coming away. Just trying to imagine what you would look like in front of Tank. Yeah.


And no comment. I don't wanna see Devin Haney fight Tank. Devin Haney don't wanna see Devin Hanney Fight Tank Did some Devin Haney supporters that feel like he got the best of them in that sparring shit. But the video didn't come out and now he's older and the better saying The video him up, Floyd released the whole thing. Yeah. And he was fucking him up. Yeah. Yeah. He was getting Shit off. He was fucking him up at At 16 So. I mean he Was fucking him up. I feel like real quick s Cool back then. I feel like real quick with with Floyd. Floyd antics at it. When he turned Money Mayweather at at one point was garnished attention. Yes. Was, you know he was Part of The brand. It's performative now. Now I'm selling the the the the brand David versus Goliath.


I'm selling Good versus Evil when they start shopping that shit on HBO you would see this wholesome Spanish dude chopping trees. Talk about it being family man doing all of this great shit. Right. Helping the community here come this chicken wing eating loud braggadocious nigga running through Vegas with 77 cars At one point. At one point too. AB was on his way doing that at ab. Like when he was doing the can man was, he wasn't winning but AB was No he was winning at the at the time. At the time he was doing it, he was winning. Then you gotta keep and then Madonna gotta Keep winning. Yeah. That my man shout to you still. You Still gotta get the job though. You still in a fight but you fight Seeing I think that the ignorant behavior people want see Yes. That whole Muhammad Ali shit, that niggas that Brag shit Bragga wanna See that in all entertainment.


That is entertaining. You lose people like that shit. Yeah we wanna see you lose. And that's what they saying. So if You, if you two mile mannered, like that's why I even think, but not I'm gonna speak about him, but when Ryan Garcia started acting a little crazy, people tune in to see like what the fuck is gonna happen. When Tyson started saying nigga my back is broken and biting it like people wanted to see the eye. This niggas fucking, and then he asked him what injuries, you know what I'm saying? People wanted to see that Watching. Yeah. I about to say Knock Out first Tyson the first round Tyson not office tank as little Mike Tyson. He was missing that fight. Yeah. You missed that fight.

I'm not trying to be funny. You sure? Yeah. I told you I liked the movie. Okay. Me too. It was a good movie.


It was a good movie. Yeah. It was almost like Eddie said. Well, this is my question for y'all. Nobody here sees the difference in what Eddie did with Beverly Hills Cop and with what Eddie did with Coming to America. Yes. Okay. That's it. Yes. He spent, that's that's it. Yes. That's all I got for y'all. Wait, he went to white people? No, he took it serious. Oh. He spent money. He spent money. That's what I thought He had to spend. Hey, if the budget was a buck 50, he made, I said he spent $5 in a pack of loosies last time. Now he took it seriously. He might've spent a couple of million dollars. Yo. You learned something. Yeah. Listen, you can't blow up the bus and all of this shit. He gotta, he gotta do it. Fucking car hanging out the window. Shit.


And the actors that's in this movie, you ain't gonna play with them. Like them coming to America. Niggas go call Nick Noey phone with some funny shit. Nick Noey. I'm talking about the younger Nick. Ty. What? What's that? Kevin Bacon? The nigga that looked like Kevin Bacon. Kevin Bacon? What's the guy's name? Kevin. Nick. Kevin. Kevin. Oh yeah, it's Kevin. You not gonna play with Kevin Bacon? Kevin? Hey, hey, I tell you one nigga, you ain't gonna play with Kevin Bacon When. you go phone, pay it up. It was somebody else And it, an older white dude. You're not gonna play with him. It was another main character in there, you know, wasn't gonna play with them actors. You gotta play them actors. So I. And the product looked like the actors. Actors are actors. They took it serious. That's what I'm saying. I like the fact that they kept the theme music throughout the movie.


So like the, they kept switching it up. They did that in the original movies. I thought that was dope. I I listened to that. I like the movie. The movie was fire. Did they pay Athe on? And if so, how much? Let's pocket watch. Because if I had to get a freebie in, he's a fool son. Forget y'all, y'all name y'all Literally, y'all have never tried to make a movie? No. Or have a wedding at some point. I did that. They paid Aon. They paid him. They paid Him. Joe. Well Hopefully he was one of the writers. How do you know? Hopefully he was one of the writers paid as well. You know, because it's Eddie Murphy production. They're not gonna fucking look. So, you Know. Huh? So you don't know that they paid Him, Joe, I'm, I'm, I'm going to assume that Aon here, we and his big age was not, is not gonna be like, okay.


Yeah, it's Netty Murphy movie. Right. At your big age, are you taking money for a fi a three minute back and forth exchange with Eddie Murphy and a new Beverly Hills Cop. Are you taking money for that? Yes. I'm not. I'm not. No you are not. I'm not demanding no money. No you are not calling. And when they say, hey, we ain't got it.

But ask him the question if he blow it up active I don Can I blow it up?


I don Dunno what you talking about. I ain't never talking about, I'm just blowing it up because niggas just get on these podcast mics and lie and we do have a female audience out there listening. So I'll say it, I'm gonna say it. Sometimes you find the right social mix where being taken is like the big joker in terms of being single. Ooh, that's a fact. Elaborate, I think I know what you're talking about, but Elaborate. Sometimes you find the right mix where being taken and moving like you taken, It's the new being single is Attractive. Is it's attractive. Very attractive. It's always been though. That's not new. Sometimes you see that and do you might have to double back.


You might Go back to the spot. Sometimes you see that. I know you talking about Without. And you might have to just circle back to the spot. I'm not talking about nobody. I'm not talking about nobody. Here go on. I'm not talking about nobody here. I got in trouble for doing this and When you circle back to the spot. I think that the Machine minus one, a lot of y'all listening are plus ones. Some, some of y'all are minus. My Wife had the rail. She knew I went back then. Nigga. Yeah, That's The bad part. She had the radar. I did that before. Ain't gonna lie. The girl know that. Why you back there? Yeah, that's the problem with that. My, she Peeped all of that before you did. Man. You wasn't gonna post it because you know that. Yeah, but they got, they phones out.

Bitches is hitting that little tab right there. My girls see pictures. I ain't even know bitches posted And there's two type of conversations. Right. So When, you go back, they already know what it was. So the conversation of views with your girl don't overcome up. They know already never Understood what's understood. Don't Even be said At all. The Muslims taught Me that. So they go straight into it. What's understood Don Don't need to be said When. you meet that clan right there. That just understands. Huh? But your, your girl won't understand or your wife won't understand.


They don't understand shit. Oh, they understand. All right. They understand. Gonna get that ass whooped. They understand they gonna whoop your ass. Not, I'm not, that's the problem. Get my ass whooped. Yeah. My wife not with none of that shit. Huh? I be, nah, I can't talk about it. But she not with none of that shit, son. The shit I thought that I could get away with like, and I thought I got SCO free out of nowhere. Like five months later she bring it up and my memory be like, that's why I have to write my notes. I did this this day. I did that that day. So because I nowhere she play, I think it's a Caribbean thing. It may not be a Caribbean thing. I think it's a woman thing to play dumb. She'll play like she don't know what's going on and act like she, I I feel like I got over.


She's still laughing and smiling and being friendly. There's nothing change game. It's the long game. I, I blame them for. But then I have a problem with that because if You can be that deceiving, are you cheating on me? I'm gonna reverse it. All right. So you that deceiving. You caught me. You got me. What you doing? Lemme see your shit. For real. I wanna get into that. So you're a narcissist And a gas. I'm a narcissist and I gaslight, I gas like I throw gasoline nigga. I work for Exxon, nigga, I work for Exxon.

This is not stranger danger, Okay? Okay. It's not stranger danger. Okay. And it's somebody that I, it's not Bear. I'm not talking about just a nigga at the bar that said that, okay, you have a rapport with this person, you speak to this person and there May be some level of chemistry there Maybe not Outward Chemistry. And that person said, Yo, how much is your rent? I'm going to pay it. It's somebody that you would accept. See, look Kobe stupid. No, no, no, no Nigga shit.


Okay fine. Jesus Christ. don don't even believe in God. Yo. Okay. Yes. Then I would, that's it. Okay, Fine. I would, if those are the circumstances, fine, I would, oh Man. And that was the end of my line of questions. I feel like not fishy there or nothing. It was not a setup. It was just asking because we were having a conversation off mic and that's it. And what was the end result of that conversation? Off mic. There was never a end result of the conversation off mic. It wasn't an end result. We did you guys come to a deduction? Like, you know, I was talking about names that I can't say, I won't say in heaven. Believe it. Y'all get of course mad at the bleeps and I made a joke and the joke was if her rent was $2,600 ta unsaid, redacted.


So they can't strip me up. Sure. That's all I said. Ian's white ass said, huh, you are weird. Why did your brain even go to what her rent is and you paying it? So we had a cultural divide now maybe. Okay, So then I said, Ian, well have you ever seen a decent proposal? And he said no. So Then, we explained to him the premise of a decent proposal, which is happily married couple with no issues at all outside other money issues of financial issues, super in love. Homeboy approaches both of 'em and offers, hey, a million dollars for one night with your wife. We got hung up on whether that included the sex part or not.


But It, it wasn't relevant. It was because that's the indecent part of the proposal. Okay. So the sex part was included and then from there, Ian and somebody else, don don't remember like is was That would that you just said don don't really understand the correlation. And then I said, well, it's following the people that believe that everyone has a price. Okay. Right. So it's it cost, cost of living. I then try to explain the end that the women whose rent is 24, 25, 26, 20 $700 in my experience bring back high ROI high ROII was explaining to them that you're paying this rent with no expectation.


You're not trying to, you're not expecting to sleep with her. You're not expecting, but you're not expecting to sleep with her. You're not paying her rent to get her to sleep with you. Okay? You're paying her rent as a kind gesture. One and two because certain groups bring back high R roll Y. So right there, I feel like men know that's where we were going. Men know which groups bring back what A high ROI So let me ask you a question. So right there, wait, so Wait has hand up. Don't do that. So I. Think we gonna ask the same question? Yeah. Right there. What's the r The alter, what's The r What's yeah, what's the return?


Oh, whatever. That differs for everybody. That difference. You don't get the same ROI with with every girl. Especially one that has let's say 2,700 ring. Okay. So what? They're not all going to reciprocate or do the same thing or, or you're not gonna get it. So to have an expectation of it would be foolish on your part, but There will be a return. Yeah. Or the Odds are there's Gonna be, the odds are high that there'll be a return. And So this doesn't classify as like an ulterior motive, even in the slightest form Of being one. I, I don't see it that way at all because if nothing changes you find you, you, you did it. Yeah. But you did it 'cause you want to, I'm I'm kind on male side with that because you no shot, But go ahead.


I wanna hear it. I do Wanna hear it because the higher you're doing this, knowing that there is a higher probability of a ROI that is the ulterior motive. If you're not, you wouldn't care about the ROI. You wouldn't care about a return at all if you just doing it not true. It ain't, if you're just doing it with no other motive, I'm just going to do it. But now once you start talking about return, that's ulterior motive. That'd be foolish to not acknowledge the return when it comes that. But you're, you're acknowledging it before it comes. All These, all these rich people do all these donations for A reason other than their generosity. And that's an ulterior. They don't necessarily gotta be the Negative one. Wait, but wait, that's not true.


That's the person assuming you, the person paying the rent assumes the risk. Like break it down in c Sure, sure. I if, if I am paying flip, we don't know what's gonna happen. But you, The only thing written on paper is that he has to show up to work. I expect because I think flip is fly A good ROI That there will be ROI. But if it ain't, he's fulfilled. He came to work, he got paid. Are you fulfilled? That's to be determined at the end of the contract. If you pay and he ain't, ain't fly, are you fulfilled? That's a good one. Punch your way out. Maybe not May, maybe not however, however, but I haven't add on to that.


However, there are people that I've kept employed with. Zero ROI Let, let me say this real quick. Were You fulfilled? I didn't say nothing. You we talking about fulfillment at this point. Oh, if I kept him employed, I'm gonna say yeah Don don't mean that. That's not true. That does not mean you fulfill And Also this is not a contractual situation. This is just like you randomly giving money to You Can, but y but hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Lemme just say this. I do agree with him. When, when the ROI is different because there was a situation, there are situations where You can pay somebody rent and you don't know When, you need him and don't have to be sexually, they could take a gun charge for you nigga. I'm just saying they could just jump. They they could come, they could be there. You saying the same thing though at a time and need, but you don't, you're not expecting that if you're looking for Sex Initially, I'm talking about just You're not expecting that initially.


You're just like, I'm looking out for you. But don, they all off What you say. If you looking for sex. You gotta go at least to the 4,500 rent. You get sex from the 2200, but you Just, yeah, but you don't have to expect it at four, at 45 and $5,500 in rent. Yeah. you know what time it is. You know from my time When, you see me, you know everything. You know fucking side Of the menu. Fucking side of the venue. She gonna hit you next month. Yeah, she would. Hey, hey. What WIG All that goofy shit, bitches. I some stupid emoji you've never seen before in your life, Nigga.


You'd be surprised what women give you When. you pay their rent randomly and tell us that. Tell Us. That's it Wouldn't be surprised Because I'm up here with niggas that's not into the tricking and all that. They try to look at you like you a martian saying, I promise I'm not looking at y'all that way. But even what You just said, don't say don't involve me. I'm married. I'm Just saying. And don't involve me because my girls are can't pay nobody rental. Exactly. Don, Don involve me. I'm just saying though, I'm not looking at them that do That. Yeah. The men do That. I'm just responding to what you said. You'll be surprised what you get. When, you pay so you are getting something, which means, you know, But you're not doing it with the intent to get something. You can just, You can just watch a You can watch a situation. Shit.


No, hold on Man. You mute up. Miss High You can Just Fucking shit. You Could just, you could just watch somebody's situation and hear they complain, hear them complaining and wanna just be a good friend and look out for them. You, you, you don't necessarily have any expectations but changes. You niggas are freaking pervert. No, that changes. I'm not even talking about sexual. You just had somebody could take the gun charge for you. Yeah. But you are doing this knowing that it's gonna come back in one way or Another. You're doing that because you not Yeah. You're not know that. That's the we the expectation because you're not stupid. That's the No, that's Expectation. The expectation, nigga. If somebody calls me, let's take it off a women and sexual and all of this shit. Yeah. If somebody called me and say, well, not me now, but me, When, I was down a little bit.

Look, Tell, sell us about her. The person let us listen. Hold up me. Hold up Joe. Huh? Per Joe, the person that makes that phone call will expect I used to act differently.
