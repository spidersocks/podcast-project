I was in Tampa, Philly, then I went to New York, then I went to Chicago for a second. Like between like Friday and Monday. God doubt. Okay. I'm gonna work on what I, my weekend reviews of myself. If you're gonna keep doing that, that ain't about to happen to me every weekend. Yeah. I went speaking that I was in Buffalo, then I flew over here. That shit terrible, man. Smoke that shit.


It was good though. It was dope. Like I, it raised a lot of money for political prisons. Live folk who locked up a couple Black Panthers got let outta prison, but they're dying or they don't have any money to, to take care of their medical bills. So I did some, some fundraisers for them. Nice. Was that compassionate release? One was compassionate release and one was just, they just gave, he, he just did 40 years. They just let him out. Jesus Christ. And, and you know, they're getting railroaded. And then I have a bookstore in Philly. So we did an event last night. If people want to check out Uncle Bobby's and for Move, a guy named Mike Africa. So we, we did a fun, not a fundraiser. We did a book event for him. So I've just been on the road a lot. That's why I don't be putting you down with him like you do. You went, what play you went to. You went to like a play. Right? A Wonderful Life Nigga was Armstrong Wonder?


It was right here. She focused on, she focused on the women. Yeah. Not even the legend. Not even Louis. She focused on the wives. Who gives a fuck. Alright, everybody had a productive week and good, good week. Yeah, we just rested. I'll ask you guys this and yes, we're not starting here and trust me, this is not a political conversation or one that I'm trying to trap y'all into some shit. But just listening to what Mark did over the weekend, has anybody here noticed a difference in how their, a difference in tone and temperament as they're having business conversations?


Oh yeah. In what regard? You mean since I? gotta be a little bit more specific. Yes. I haven't had any major negotiations since me neither Wednesday. So My accountant was like, we outside Like the election. Like we good. I did notice some Bitcoin numbers and some stock numbers. Now I don't want to come in here and like pod with black guilt. Shit looking good. Okay. Shit looking good. Look, I'm not going to lie to y'all. Should I? Shit is moving out there moving Tonight.


It is, I don't know. That is what you say. He said It is Temporary. It might be, it Might be be reactionary. I don't know that to be true. I mean, I, I think it depends on what side of the coin you are on. I think that, you know, this hate, nah, the haves going. The Haves. The haves going haves going keep having and, and and and the have nots. It is going, it's gonna get worse for the have nots and it's gonna get better for the haves. Is that fair to say? Yeah. I, that gap is gonna grow. So the goal is to be exponential. Yeah. I know that. Not like us Tweet saying shit. One of the funniest shit I've seen in a while. Shit. They not like us Tweet that he sent out. Yeah. That ho out. Trump. Trump.


I didn't see that. I didn't see that. It started my day. But I was saying did not let us by Kendrick Lamar. I love this song. An American song. I've listened to this song repeatedly. I heard my team sing it after I won. I thought, wow, that's a great song. Funny that the Canadians think that they're better than us. They're not. Canada is crumbling in itself and it's because of this song. Sorry, a little tweet. Oh my god. Wow. What a fucking snake. What? Yo, he's not a real person, yo. He did, That's what It is. He's not a real person. I wish I could just laugh at the shit without like, like implications of Your world, right? Like I'm talking to somebody yesterday, a Puerto Rican woman and she's telling me about how her parents was beating her down.


You know, Kamala, Kamala, Kamala, Kamala, Kamala, Kamala, Kamala, and yeah, I'm, I'm going to do that because woman reproductive rights, blah blah blah, blah. And she said, but I want to tell my parents your dog. I'm a business owner too. And when Big T is in there, I kind of get shit moving a little bit. I said I voted Kamala, but let's see what happens out there. Your dog. That Bitcoin wouldn't stop going up. Not that I am know that it's attached to Trump. Oh, It is. Even though It is, but that Bitcoin, every time I open my phone I was killing yesterday.


Yeah. Like killing That shit was stagnant for years. Nah. Yes it was. It was, it was okay. I watched it. It's just, all right, I see Kat got your tongues. I I not tell you. I feel, Hey, don't worry about it Joe. I feel guilty. I the companies and corporations out there are and they, they, I'm, I'm hearing them have a different tone than they've had in the past years. That's all I'm saying. I think, I think a one of optimism and one of uncertainty, I think that's probably common with a new president with a major policy. The funny, the funny, the funnier, the funnier part is, Hey Mark, I don't fuck.


I just wanna tell you, you guys Yeah, I don't care. It's still funny tweet funny, But we, we don't wanna report nothing false. Oh my bad. It is it was I Don It is daily Loud, loud, daily loud instead of daily loud posted there. Ah. Oh, okay. Look at I Got it. I appreciate funny, You know, we love, we love the fake shits. Yeah. All I know is, again, I you can say it Mark. It's okay. I I I feel guilty about it. But money is talk nigga money is better if, if you in a 1% or even the 5% This shit ain't even close and you all there. I just wanna tell y'all. Yeah. I mean, yeah. I just wanna tell y'all, they don't give a fuck about what We talk about right now.


They not in the 1%. They, this is like rubbing shit in people faces. They don't wanna hear that shit. See, I, I disagree with that ice. I disagree a lot. I see it. They like is get up here. I'm not talking about how they feel. I'm not talking about that. Okay. That nigga ice ain play. I'm, I'm talking about the perspective of it. It's not just, it's not just, hey those in the 1% are talking this yada yada yada y It is, if you at are at home broke and are looking to start a business, then there should be optimism for you. Cool. But a lot of people are not at home broke because they busting they ass at two, three jobs to put food on the table. Facts. And some of them can't start the business, but some of them when they go home, so they're kind of trapped and they don't want to hear people's up here who not in the same predicament talking about how good and how up shit is.


That's all. Oh, then those are people that just prefer to be blind. I think that, so we gotta hide how we feel. We talk about it's not hide how you feel. There's a way, there's a, there's a line empathize with them. Hell yeah, it's a good Patreon conversation. 'cause I'm on the other side. Okay. Ice. But It is, I empathize, but we got, we got, we open with this at it. We empathized it right now. I at it, I think that anybody that feels optimistic about starting a business, this is my, I had this convers That was your time. I did, I did shout the backfield, they podcast the other day. And I said that for all of the people that say, yo dog, when Trump in office, we getting money. So that means before Trump got the office, when Obama was in office, you was broke.


Then Trump got the office, you got some money allegedly. And then Biden is in office now you back broke. Nigga you don't get money. You, you, the problem, you don't get money. If you need the president to change for you to get some money, you not a money getting nigga. Mm. That's it. You not a hustler. You don't have no hustle. You not getting no money. All of that shit about these new businesses. When Trump come fucking Biden and Obama was giving niggas hundreds of thousands of dollars. I came in here and talked about it. Mad times niggas were starting companies. You had to have a 700 credit score with nothing else. And you coulda got 150, 200, $300,000 in business credit with no experience. No nothing. You ain't out here trying to get no Spanky. If you gotta wait for Donald Trump to get in presidency for you to get some money. That's why I'm they not, they're not one, one word you put in there was hustlers.


These people, a lot of 'em wasn't hustlers. I, I not, they just, they accepted a handout damn near to what they thought it was basically, Hey, the president cut me a check, which is anti-Republican. I thought it won't take handout. That's why they saying we gonna get money. I thought we won't take handouts except for the corporations and the rich people. So my point is, yo dog, that shit is fake. It's fake it. Everybody's listening to what everybody else is saying with no concrete proof. If you wanted to start a business when Biden was in office, you could, there was mad opportunities for you to start your business and to get some leverage and become successful. I think that's all true. But if you have a small business, like I have a, I guess yeah, it's a It is a, it'd be considered a small business. I have a bookstore, I have a cafe tax policy tax. I definitely got a better situation under Trump. I'm not def I I still didn't don't want Trump.


'cause I don't, I worry about the other people more than I worry about myself, but I'm trying to tell you is up. Yeah. Okay. That's all I was saying. Deer's deer's an influx. I ain't about to pretend like I know where It is coming from, but I recognize that deer's an influx of shit and just a change in how people are talking. Yeah, I I agree. I think it's based on nothing could be. I mean I'm just saying We talk, I'm just saying it's based on nothing. We talk about how this podcast helps people get through their day, helps people detach from whatever's going on out there in the world. And if they fucked up and then you sitting up here and a bunch of people are talking about how good shit is and how up It is. It's It is a reminder in your face. Lemme ask you a question, but I'm the person but I'm the person that tell those same exact people they can get money.


I sit in my dms all day and talk to niggas about getting money. If you want to get money, my nigga get off fucking Instagram and go read some books on how to get some Spanky. Yeah. And it's niggas on Instagram showing you how to get money every fucking day. That's the problem. Truth. They they, they looking for advice and looking for sympathy instead of getting up and going to get they're they're not looking no disrespect but's looking. Niggas are looking to get their hands held and walked to how to get the money. But. yeah, but that's what I'm It is we not nigga you have to listen. There's research, there's tools out there that you can research and find a way to get money. Niggas should be up here to express themselves and have fun with the content that we're putting out there. You know what I mean. There's not rubbing in anyone's face. Nigga, if you feel that way, It is black guilt now Fuck that I don't believe in that. It is black guilt. I feel guilt. I'm black guilt, I don't got black guilt.


You feel a little bit of guilt. Why? That's I up sending nigga's money. I don't the time I don't got black guilt. That's the problem. I Got it. I Got it. That shit went to 89. And I said so talking about you think I pay a credit card off this morning? Let me get some of that hat, dead ass sweater. Got that. What can we, what can we do about our black guilt? Nothing. Nothing give to the people. Be charitable. Yeah, yeah. Like Mark just said. Yeah. And I try to fight to change the system but you know that you do. That's what I do. But I also acknowledge that I have, I acknowledge that I have more than I need and so I try to give it. That actually was why I was wrote the the Quincy Jones show on the board of show. I hate y'all niggas so much. It's amazing. You got more than you need. Huh? We all got, we, we all got more than we need.


I don't, I don't know that, I don't know. I don't have more than I need you just talking about niggas hungry, eating fucking moldy bread and shit and getting, being mad. He the same moldy bread and now you saying we ain't got more than we need every, we all got more than we need. So, so your thing is to is to, is to put a bandaid on a deep wound instead of helping them heal. Right. That's I said getting money. No, that's, I nigga walk them, the niggas I get money to is in jail. So it's different. Different be clear to be clear. Yeah. I don't just give random niggas. Like for example, my brother, he locked up right now. He been locked up for a long time. I still on and off. Right. So I hate giving him money 'cause sometimes I'm like this ain't helping you. But I also, it's hard to sit here bro. I'm with you on, but it's also, It is hard to sit here with money and, and not give a nigga money. Even though I know you making bad choice.


Come on, show you how this Nigga, this nigga about to make a Bitcoin wrap. This nigga about to make a Bitcoin wrap. Oh. Kenny not cancel no more. Yo and yo you've been continuously buying. Yeah. Oh yeah. I I know that he show his ass must stop 'cause I'm guilty the way you, I feel guilty Gonna do that.


come on off Oh Shit. No, no, no. Oh Shit Love Yeah man. This nigga fool. Yo. Quincy Jones. Quincy Jones. No, the reason I say That is Quincy Jones. Quincy Jones, according to reports, left all of his money to his children. Apparently each of his children got somewhere between 70 and $80 million. Damn. I thought it was 80 plus like 83. I I've heard two different reports. So I wanna be, but I I I suspect It is what you just said. It is 83. But I've heard two different reports. But, but the point is you have 500 over $500 million and you give it all to your children.


Is that the right choice? I don't think It is. I'm not, yes. I would never do that shit. Okay, well how would you divvy that would, I don't understand. Y'all battered women. Right? I don't get you some, some calls nigga the whale s not bad. Yo, you know the Alaskan rabbits, right? Extinct rabbits battered women feed the whale dead. That's how y'all view women. What's something about rabbits fucking whale? We were cracking on Martin saying he's leaving his money to come on to other charitable things. I, if I got, how do the women get, if I got half because he Brought it to women.


He said battered women. Damn. Why you pointing At me? Right? Because you I got outta that quick. I know. Yeah, yeah. You passed that case quick. Look. No, this is what I'm saying. If I got half a billion dollars and I had eight kids, I would leave them something. I would do more than Warren Buffet approach. I'm gonna give y'all something. What's but what is the something, how much of the pie? 10 million. Wait, excuse me. Each a piece. A piece? Yeah. And what would you do with the rest? I would give it to people who need it. I would invest it in society. I would repair things. I would create programs. I would do shit to lead the world better. Nobody needs half a billion dollars. Stop. The, the problem with That is a piece. This nigga is the man. No, this nigga is not love stick. Oh my mom I would It is like college for me.


Iron him. Yo, the problem with That is when you leave it to somebody else, ain't no guarantee on how they gonna utilize the bread. Exactly. Like I remember when Zuckerberg gave Newark a million, a hundred mil gave the educational system in Newark a hundred million dollars. I ain't gonna shit on my town. But but it went, it went other places. Yeah. You get what I'm saying? So when you start leaving that bread to somebody, ain't no guarantees on how they gonna utilize that bread or it's gonna do what you wanted it to do. If you raised your kids accordingly, I think that's your kids will be charitable and your kids will do things that would benefit society. What if you had a lot of faith in your kids and your, your parenting and you're like, I got good kids. They're gonna yeah you and figure out something better to do with This still responsibility. I don't care if my kids took it and put it on black.


I ain't here no more. Y'all are my offspring. Y'all get it? Yo fuck everything else. Do whatever y'all do with it. Like I might leave something like an alma mater or something and you put the things in the trust where this got 'em. Remain a science center or this gotta remain a performer. Arts building. You know what I'm saying? Shit. Shit. So, so if you got a half a billion dollar, you giving all of it to your kids. Yes. You that's i I mean even if I did or I didn't, the majority of that money would go to my kids and my family. The majority. The overwhelming majority. Now then your name ain't gonna be on the gymnasium nigga. That's what I'm saying. Like if you wanted do that nigga Getting rid of the education of the country anyway. Like if you want to some shit like that then that matters. I'm not against that.


I just don't think nobody needs that much money. Who said that? Who's everybody who said anything I need though. Right. That's all what I'm saying. Why they don't, why why so hard? 'cause there are people who do I work this hard and now I've got this all and I'm I'm outta here. I'm leaving it to my offspring. Why you work this hard nigga you on 17 planes a weekend. But 'cause I actually think the work is important. I value it and I think it leaves the world better. What you do it for free Deadass. So I enjoy, I'm not saying I don't enjoy spending money and I don't enjoy buying things. I'm just saying does limits you. I don't You. right. Oh. Because he asked why I did the work that I don't do the work. I do it for money. Money. That's, I said what? He said would you do it for free? You talking? Yeah, we do it for free. Yeah, we'll do it for free. Y'all heard 'em think Mark would do it for free. I give 200 speeches a year.


150 to 200 speeches a year. I give her free You. know, know what I mean. That's fine. Where, where I give the money or I donate it right back. Dead ass. Now I, I make good money on speeches so I'm not saying like it's not a sacrifice and and that 50, where did you get like such that 50, you talking me, you talking to Meki, the 50, that 50. Where did you get such a good heart? That's what my mom and dad say all the time. Like you got a good heart. It's just who I am. It is crazy. He was raised that way. Yeah. I mean which means your children Children Yes. Will be raised that way to continue that. Oh they got you. They got you. If you put your kids in charitable shit early, I'm going to introduce you to my children. Gotcha. And then you'll be like, nigga where the wells at. Yeah. Got you.


No save save them ducks. Them ducks. Shit. I feel you. No, no. Like my kids are great. I love them and I think they would do responsible things with the money. I just don't think they need half a billion dollar. That's it. I just don't think they need half a fucking billion. And and again, Quincy Jones' kids ain't exactly. You got mad kids, they're not getting half billion dollars. Yeah, some of them, some of them are very successful now. I mean Rashida Jones needs another 80. Ada needs another. I mean, yes. Yeah. Now even compounding on the work that you do, do you think that to really, really actively change the inequities in the system? Money is a thing to do that money is one of the cogs that turned that around. That's true. So if I have already raised responsible kids, if I've already raised diligent children, then them having the, the money piece just helps.


That will keep Turner. Maybe I just know that if I had a half a billion dollars, I could send a lot of kids to college for generations. I could send a whole housing project to college. Agree for generations. I agree with that. Or I could leave it to my kids and the money could be done. It could be anything. You know what I mean and again, I'm not leaving them with nothing. 10 million. If you, if you can't live with 10 or $20 million and turn that into something then, then you ain't no hustler. What? What can't you do with $20 million? If I never had to hustle before, I'm gonna blow it. Then why am I gonna leave him half a billion? Yo, we heading toward a society that's doomed if you don't know how to hustle. Yes. Yes. I think we damn near already. We there almost. We been there. We there bro.


Unless don don have that entrepreneurial bone in you or that, that hustler mentality, you gonna be left behind. Yep. Unless you got some weird talent like you, like LeBron and some shit where you just get paid to. Talent is always gonna make Yeah, talent is gonna be talent. But you still gotta have hustle with talent though. Yeah. It is a very small group of people I think that are just out here. That's why I'm thinking of new ways to do shit. The side that that ice, not ice argument but the point that ice brought up earlier about just how you share on public broadcast. It's really about who you're talking to. Like I'm never, I'm never talking to the sheep. I agree with that. I'm always gonna go get the info and bring it to the niggas that's going do something with it. Like when you listening to this for me feel like you listening to the ground level of, of things and a different channel.


What's up yo, some of these days boy I be wanting to clock your motherfucker. I've been saying this for three years, doc. Yo, some of these days boy, you get in your mood. I've been saying the same shit. Yo Ish don't nobody wanna hear that shit. Yo, you serious ass out. Don't nobody wanna hear about your Bank of America, Wells Fargo. Shit. Yeah, a little bit. A little bit. What about a lot of it about what I just said said that Ish hasn't been saying No, no, I'm just saying. But no, I, I I agree with you a thousand percent, but when I do that, yeah. Say that nigga. No, when I, no, when I do that you be like man don't nobody hear he say you been saying the opposite. He's saying, you been saying saying nobody want to hear that shit.


Like I think that he's saying when he said you step on it and don't want to just talk shit no matter. I think we need many valid points. Any of y'all bring up. We know you don't say that. You saying something wrong yo. Nah, I think that we just, especially you because the eyes have been on you for the last 20 years So niggas have seen Dirty Tank top Joe and now niggas see Bottega Joe. I still Got it though. Got what? Got a dirty tank top. You got a frame somewhere on the wall. Wall? That shit ain't no. I said I got my dirty Holy Tank top. You ain't got, I just got high blood pressure too. So you gotta chill out. Yeah, that fucking 44 boy. I just think that shit is inspirational when somebody can watch you throughout your path and your journey and see that these things are attainable.


I think that shit is dope. And I think we need to show that more often. I agree with that. I agree with that. Do y'all agree there's a way to show it and not call niggas broke? A thousand percent. That's all I'm saying. They don't, I'm not disagreeing with you. No, I'm not disagreeing with you. Disagree. Lemme ask you a question. I though I Did somebody come up to you? I used, people have been explaining, complaining about Yeah, no, they, I talked to people, they've been complaining. A have been complaining. They complain online. They complain in person. They be like, yo man, come on man. Everybody ain't got, they think we rich, rich. Yeah they do. I mean Rich, rich, rich nigga. I seen, I seen, I seen the other day y'all Got it at a million.

I don't me then don't talk to me about it. You know you're unapproachable. Yeah, that's true. And And you don't go outside. No, I do go outside. I mean, you know what I'm saying? Like socially now I'm outside a lot more. But what I'm saying is that, that that must be, that's why I stopped doing interviews the way I was doing them. That must be a headache to look at. You had to come up here and defend This shit. Yo. Yo, come on nigga. Don't. I don't have no fucking headphones on. Why you? I didn't do nothing. Why you doing that to me? Man? I didn't do that. This nigga already implied that he get paid a lot of money, nigga. I'm fucking tight. I'm joking. I didn't give a fuck nigga. I turned This shit up. Stop. Remember the glasses still there. Stop the glasses. We just had a great conversation.


Nigga got Kian called That is nigga from yo. But you know what's funny about you? Somebody else making a lot of money shouldn't do nothing to you. You should want to, you should be like me when fucking Dayday or forests came through with the Benzs, the MPV, all that shit back in the nineties. I was like, yo, I wanted to get that I gotta work harder. How? Just how man, how is that happening? So the same way you niggas out there, they told you like the Livingston the same way you niggas out there like the pocket watch. 'cause that's fun sometimes. Hustle. It is, y'all should also discipline. Watch and hustle. Watch y'all. Y'all should also patience. Watch hard watch. Y'all should also how you, how he responds to adversity.


Watch. Mm. Y'all should talk about his, the willful watch. Just watch and see how willful niggas is. Talk about niggas don't get derailed or deterred There you from what that vision is. Probably watching It is fun. Only if you going to do the rest of the watch and to get to the how he doing that. They can't see respect, they can't see your patients'. And then I then I then I learned how they can't your sleepless nights and said and said and have this, Hey self-awareness. Watch wear it all. Watch. When I found out what day they were doing, I said, oh I can't do that. I can't do that. Yo, you did this. What? I can't do that. Wait a minute. Huh? I can't do that. Can't. No, no, no. You Got it. That's it. No all night. Hey, hey, hey.


Is it cold? Hey TLC said I like sleep too much. Stick. Stick to the rivers and the lake that you used to or Pebbles. Somebody else said, no scrub. Don't go chase the waterfall. Yo. You ran from who can't do that Nigga shot at what? No, no, no, no, no. That's great. Yeah. Anyway. Dayday. Yo, that's funny. Facing how many years for real? No, they, Dayday was lit. Dayday had the girls day. They could fight. Dayday had the jewelry, Dayday had other things that would be unsaid. They had respect from his peers, from the hood, from the, you just watch his name be like, Hey, how's that happening? Yeah. And then you learn versus any other hateful shit that like, yeah. Anyway.


Did they, anyway, if there's any creators out there that want to have a conversation with me about anything while you see me outside, don't but send a DM or something and and you'll ignore it and try to get the, try to get the line of communication open. Damn man. And you'll ignore it. Oh, why you say that? Because you won't even talk to 'em out fucking side. So why would you even answer your fucking dms if somebody saying, Hey yo Joe, let Me get some like, you Know, financial advice. What do you think that I should do? You'd be like, like fuck you Sell a brick. Right. Call dating. Yeah, we say that. We say that and it's funny. So I ain't never gonna step on it, but there's plenty of people behind the scenes that I covertly coached through this, this content thing.


We had content creators tell you that though. I caught Joe and you helped do shit. Shit. Plenty. I know my reputation is horrible. Only to the broke people. I think you do it to niggas that you're fond of. He that the shit you're about only to broke people. I think niggas that you respect or like or you're fond of, that you give them advice, you're not, what's wrong with that? Nothing wrong.

Would you what? Burn it. What I think, I think, I think, I think Mark opened my mind to saving the world a different, a different way of thinking. Maybe I don't give all of it to my kids.


Maybe I don't, I never looked at it the way that, the way that he described it. Because we're just trained and and programmed to, Hey, I love my kids. They get everything. But what El, if I didn't give 'em it all, what else would, would I wouldn't be fantastic to see. You could go to Jersey City. Yeah. And give money to the school. Get, go get and get your name on a building, all of that. A gymnasium, a library, the button, civic center, shit like that for the kids button. you know what I mean? Basketball court. And then what'll happen is you could have a trust set up where as long as it stays a civic center that reach for the outreach for the children. A million dollars or 2 million of dollars a year will be put toward the maintenance of that particular structure. Also endowment's a bunch. Yeah, it's a bunch of shit. When you start getting that money. Money. Oh that shit goes. However, you also, you used to say that Quincy gave all his money to his kids.


Like we don't know that part. That's a good point. More we just know It is net worth and how much he left. So, but he could have more money than we know. 'cause Zy wasn't flashy. That's what I'm saying. That's true. That's possible. That's true. But 80 million, a person's still a alive. And he could have, he could have instructions for the kids. That's true too. You could have that where they have to. I don't know how old all of his children are, but you know, you gotta take you, you have to have taken some sort of financial course or something to understand the money and instructions on what to do with the money. You don't remember how the nigga ghost left Tarek the money like yo, you gotta graduate from the school. He want some power. Shit. m right nigga left his son money and the trust that said yo, you have to graduate school with a certain GPA or you forfeit getting this bread.

Everybody in those places. No it, I heard a lot about each in the streets. This I did too. I I've been hearing a lot about my man this week. I heard a lot about my man in the streets.

I don't know. I just don't know anymore. come on, let's talk about the Young Thug tweet and delete. Yes. Young Thug tweet and delete. I still don't know what none of it means. What was the tweet? I don't know. Basically like don't gunna don't act like we don't act like we friends, right? Yeah, we friends for the internet or something.


Yeah. Yeah. I don't know you I don't know you right now. Yeah, yeah. Mm. I mean, you know a lot. Did he say it was hacked? No, he didn't say nothing. He say nothing. He didn't say anything. He just deleted it. It was, yeah, but then he make a song and said Gunna wasn't a rat then. Wasn't that something that he put out when he came home? He didn't put anything out since he's been home. Oh. So that was an ai. I don't know if it's ai, if it's a snippet, but he didn't put anything out. Got you. He hasn't said anything. He hasn't made any statements. He hasn't said a word since he's been home. Hey yo Thug. Here's the thing and I I I love Thug, right? But the thing is, is that please Doug, whoever have your phone or if you're doing it, please do not rub this in. These people face you, you home. Now You know what I mean.


You got the probation, you doing your thing. Please do not have people tweet anything to make it seem like you're igniting some type of issue with gunna or other people. That was a part of the case because all it's gonna do is put different eyes on you or more eyes on you that they'll need to be, they're gonna use the magnifying glass in this situation. And I want you to be home and enjoy yourself. It's It is not necessary. Whoever has this account, nigga take that account from them if just we'd rather hear the music as long as nobody getting hurt but they really listening. The thing that that judge said to you, she really meant it and your story resonated with her. So, and then she was sympathetic and empathetic. So please bro, This shit for me.


Real shit. Yeah, that great Thank, you look at your foot. I respect that. I don't have nothing to say. I thought you body down. No you can't take Compli was good. You can't take compliments. I was good. All right nigga. This one nigga dead ass. This make a nigga feel like you killed that chicken nugg shit. Nugg. Y'all taking your time drink nigga. Let's move on. I was a fish sandwich. s good right there. Your body die. I'm not on, I'm no, I'm not on Gunner rat watch. So I'm, I will exclude myself from all conversations moving forward about I I am, I am low key. I mean I, I wanna know how people are interpreting him.


I wanna know how people see him, whether he's good or not. Just for the, just Yeah. Just to understand what's going on and, and also to think about what kind of music's gonna come out. Well let, let me, let me let you go with you. I I I, my theory is, you know what I, you know what I said a couple episodes ago, I just, I I understand how somebody could interpret his behavior as snitching. That's all I'm gonna say. You said I told my gun as when you say people, when you say how people view him, what you talking about thug in him or the the public. What do you mean? How anybody could Based on what? Based on information that me as a fan has access to the idea of saying yes we are a gang. Or the idea of saying it's me, you in a car and that ain't mine. To me, both of those things are questionable.


If you operate in the streets, Got it. If you operate in the streets, again, it's not my business, I don't care. But I am curious to know how he gets received. That's all I'm saying. Well, I'm gonna let you know since that has happened and he came home just talking about gunna. Yeah, he's done quite a few sold out shows at across the country. He's dropped albums that did great that yeah. Two albums that had done great. He's outside of feature work with other artists. He moving like he ain't missed the beat until the word comes down. Yeah, but no, no, no official. I mean he is done it without features. That that's what I'm saying. What what can the word do at this point? So what is word coming down? His fan. Lemme tell you something.


You, you tell me. If if Thug say he he not good, he snitch. You think it's not gonna matter. It definitely matters. I don't think it matters. I don't think it matters to today. I don't think it matters. I, because the pe I'm, I'm gonna tell y'all why I don't think it matters because the people that have been buying his music that have still been supporting him, that have been going to these shows have all been saying we don't care. I think it's easy to not care when nothing's being said. I think it's harder to care when somebody says that's a rap. Yeah. You talking about if if Thug says it Yes. Say that's what I'm saying. Yes. I think if the s slaps keep slapping, I don't know if it's gonna matter. And Thug ain't never gonna say it. He ain't gonna say it. That's changing the subject. But if Thug comes out and says it, I think it's gonna limit the number of producers that might wanna work with him. Let's also go It is also gonna limit, makes features hard and and modify how he's viewed even by some of the casual fans that might be tied into the streets.


Change. I change what you just said. I'm just looking at the pro, the projects that he's put out since this all happened, it ain't been the big name features that been working with him before. All the big, I mean, excuse me. Excuse me. Producers. It ain't been them. I don It is been his man. Turbo. Yeah. I don't know that all dog friends is so hot no more. I don't, I don't know it. I I'm gonna keep it a buck with y'all. Just from what it looks like. Rap. Is it a total disarray? The niggas that had it lost it. Everybody ain't Got it. It's new Niggas on the scene, nigga, nigga don't want, niggas don't want to admit it. All them niggas. That's, that's basically picked aside when this happened and said we rolling with thug until thug say something we not gonna fuck with. Gunna he doing better than all them niggas.


That's a fact. They need him way more than he needs them. That's a fact. Niggas are gonna call him when it's when it's dry out here for you. They gonna call Gunner because he's still hot. What? Not if the facts come out that he, he told. That's all I'm saying. I think I didn matter more than all that. What if he had nothing effect should ask. Lemme ask you a question. What if he had nothing to do with it in the first place? Right. Ru if his situation of he really wasn't, even if he was aware but he wasn't a part of it. Sometimes you could be cool with niggas that's that's in the gang or cool with the head niggas, but you're not necessarily a part of shit. And then sometimes you really truly don't know. Yeah. Well I don't want to go that far. But. yeah, you, you you, you really. So what about, what you say? Y'all want a real answer or y'all want apologize? I want a real answer sometimes.


Listen, I was listen we can speak from experience dish. We've been cool with niggas at them. Niggas didn't involve me in the, I knew what they was doing but they didn't involve me in in in it. So if y'all ain't turn y'all back on no rats, y'all still fly with everybody. Both. You nigga shut up. Who, who? Buffer. Who wasn't who? You and Flint. What? Rat. You don't know. No rat fly. Why don't you nigga put a name on a bullet nigga if even though I did scared you if you were is who, who was the rat? I said you were. If don't apply, let it fly. See that's excuse bitch. Y'all can say the, you know I say the name. Who's the rat know who you talking about? Yo what I'm saying. I know who you talking about with is YI know who he talking about with you. He don't know who he talking about with me neither nigga. 'cause I ain't friends with no rats. Somebody told that's a rat. That friends with Ish.


The the the person that he keep bringing up when he talk to him. Who is you talking about? Okay. Some secret shit. Yeah. Yeah. s that they bring up on. I I wanna answer about that. I think it depends on where you from and what you, what you, what you believe in. So how I was raised and people around me. If you are engaging in any type of activity, which allegedly he was doing and if you get caught up in that, you know the consequences of your actions prior to you ever suffering. Any consequences. Do You think a majority of the record buying public Cares, care cares has that stance? No. Or knowledge?


He, he asked me about something different but a lot of shit they was talking about in the case it was back in the days before Gunner was on YSL and some while he was there. I'm just saying why would thug, 'cause I do think I disagree with you. I think that That is a part of this conversation. Why would Thug step on his own dope? I can't see him ever doing that one. That's not true. Two, in the event that he did, I think it makes gunna bigger. One you step on your own dope when you could sell your own dope. Mm. When he was locked up he couldn't sell no dope. Homeboy was coming out, he was generating income. And so that's one thing now that I'm home that don't make sense. Yes it does. Let me finish, finish, let finish.


When, when Gunner was locked up and this is all speculative, I mean when Thug was locked up, gunner came out, he dropped two projects. So whatever money was generated, whatever revenue was generated from those projects, thug might have needed that money. So I'm gonna be moms the word while you are generating money for me when I'm in a fucked up situation, right. Do only be Kanye your nose to spite your face. But it's the second thing's not true. Kanye, your nose face and that's what they do in the street. You will cut your nose off to spite your face. If you standing on principle. Money and principle are two totally different arguments. Sometimes to some people principle trump's money. I know, but I don't be having a principle talk. I be having a business talk. But if you're having a talk and you looking at it from thug's perspective, you are saying Fuck that money I'm standing on principle.


No you not. No, no. You're no he's not saying that. Hold on, hold on, hold on. You're not. If he was saying that he wouldn't have told the judge the one person that I need to speak to, I wanna be able to communicate with that was a member of this case. It is gunna, It is my brother and gunna. Yeah. He was not have included gunna in that. That's why stance. Here's why you might do that. It's if that's his stance to step on that dope. Here's why you might do that first. It's not true first. Also you can't put the word on somebody rat while you on trial. 'cause 'cause that makes you look like you still involved. And number two, he is a artist on my label. Right? And I to speak to him to conduct business or even just to have a conversation with, which is the business point that we talking about. Listen, don't mean you fucking with him. That don't mean you fuck with him. If I have to talk to him, I might literally have to cut him from the label I own. This is why I hate these principle niggas.


Now y'all conveniently speak to him when you want, but I'm not fucking with you because of my principles. If you label don't speak to him. I have my lawyer drop up the paperwork talking about the game. I I might be doing This shit to cut you from the label. If if I, if somebody works for me, you are not stop. We have to stop just saying shit. You are not dropping your cash cow no from your label at all. You're not doing it. Even if you think he's a snitch Joe. No, not doing it Joe. You not doing it. There's some people, some people would do that. Some people would. Who a lot of people would do that. We got a hundred years in the music business. Point me to one person that's done it. We all we have is a pattern of niggas working through their discrepancies because it's way too much money involved in music business.


Y'all can't fool me with that shit. Y'all tell your fucking street buddies, sorry. Nah, that shit don't work on me. We'll see. But we don't know anybody that told well the fuck outta here. We don't know. We, this is a, this is a new instance. I can't think of a instance. That's somebody they can before. I don't know of one. I don't know. What I'm telling you is, and yo dog, let's ask shoddy if he deaded the akashi paperwork when he read it. What the fuck are y'all talking about here? I don't know what that means. Forget it. I get what you're saying. All this principal and moral shit. I'm sick of it. Niggas is out here doing shit for the dollar that's better than them. I've been fighting trial with the most high price lawyers in the universe. I'm taking care of a million niggas. You'll be a fool to now turn down your top tier act or say yo, I'm staying on principle.


I'm not taking a dollar from you face. Tell that shit to listen. Principle niggas tell that to them to. You can't use the shoddy shit because he told on them niggas in court, yo bigger than that point nigga do it to come home and generate income myself. And then on top of that, if he did that nigga, nigga what when has generating income yourself meant that you don't want all income that's dude owe to you. That don't mean that yo dog you, you're not willing to listen to what I'm saying bro. So go ahead. You Got it. That's dismissive. I hearing you. I'm counseling. Listen what I'm telling you. Yes. He's home making his own money. Let's let's say hypothetically thug, we gonna throw out numbers. Thug can make a hundred dollars. Gunner can make a hundred dollars. Right. I could live off the a hundred dollars. The second that I'm able to provide for myself and my family myself.


The two, I don't have to deal with him no more right now. When I was in, when I was, if you care care about the rat. Yes. If you care about the rat, if you stand on that principle, I don't have to deal with that no more bro. Yeah. I'm gonna short circuit listening to you niggas. My that's dismissive my response. It is not 'cause I'm gonna respond to your point, my response to That is he don't have to deal with him or talk to him for this contract to be acknowledged. Correct. He don't have to have I see what you saying Don worry. No communication with Gunner. Not a word, but his contract is still stand. I'm not turning. Lemme not say me. 'cause we already established that everybody different. I don't believe that these niggas are doing that. I think that they are lying and fronting for cameras.


Maybe not Dirk. We will see maybe not a short list of people that that whose lineage come from that genetically. No, sorry, young Doug did the right thing. Yo Judge, I need to talk to him sometimes. Yeah, you fucking right. You need to talk to him. He's one of the hottest nigga in the world. I'm go to jail. Yeah, we will see I'm I'm not saying he going to cut it. I'm saying tweet got the tweet got deleted right fast. But, but why, why tweet that? Why don't know that I know that he tweeted that. But I know the tweet got deleted fast. Yeah, because know what you're doing because now you throwing rocks hot in your hands. No, no. You throwing rocks at the jail. You throwing rocks at the jail. That's what I'm saying. Like I, I can put it out there, get the word out and delete it and say it wasn't me.


So then there's even more reason for Gunner brother responded too. So then there's even more. Yeah, but I ain't even getting into that Got it So there's even more reason for him to, for him to fucking continue communication with gun. Listen to this. It's or and not tweet that and not come out and say, yo, he's a rat. He's a snitch. Hey industry, this is how I feel about him. This mad reasons to not do that principle my ass like I need a I'm, I need a principle test. I'm sick of that in 2025. What's the I need? I don't know. We gotta come up with it. We'll see. But I need a test. I'm looking for the niggas out there that hey, principle, principle, principle, principle. And I don't know it. You just got a microphone nigga. Show it. Joe. Joe jojo. Show me I. gotta see it. We know niggas that live by principle. Yo, when LeBron left Cleveland do one of take the gun to contract, put a lighter or two it publicly burn it, step on it and announce to everybody, y'all don't fuck with him no more.


Knock get the fuck off the fuck off. So are you saying, are you saying that principles and morals in 2025 or 20 Yeah man left this network. I took whatever penny came for the a nigga and no longer last. And we ain't never gonna talk but send that quarterly. Thanks. So you telling we gotta be friends. You telling me if you was looking at a trillion from what y'all, I don't what y'all talking about. Lemme ask you a question. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Lemme ask you wild. Lemme you this question two different and I want, I want to be careful. No I'm not. Yes you are. Joe. Joe, you and Mandy and whatever you and Mandy Inc went through don't even remotely pale in comparison to these niggas potentially spending the rest of their life behind bars. That's you speaking for me? I am. Lemme ask you a question but you can't speak for me. Yes I can because I know the severity of spinning the life behind bars and whatever the fuck you and Mandy went through.


Yes I can Ish Ish. That's you speaking for me and speaking for somebody else's principle. My premise is the same. No it's not. My premise is exactly the same. You speak is the same we do. No it's not, not you speak to Mandy. Speak lemme land. No I don't. No I don't. I'm I just saw you speak to Mandy two weeks ago. Three, three weeks ago. Ish, Ish. I'm telling you something. I don't give a fuck about what you seen. I'm telling I never saw you with I speak to the girl that when somebody move funny and I create distance, I'm still taking my coins. I don't give a fuck what you saying nigga. I'm taking my money. That's This shit way It is gonna take his fucking money. That's it. Show me I'm from fucking Missouri. You principle niggas enough lies.


Enough lies on pods. Yeah, but I, enough of it. So lemme ask you a question enough of this. So lemme in the middle. Many lies. Lemme ask you a question. None of y'all have principles. I'm sick of it. Now lemme ask you a question. Your grandfather had principles, lemme ask you a question. When you walked away from complex, that was your principles doing that? Yes. So I thought principles is gone. There was no contract which stated that either one of us had to continue with an exchange of money. You are more contract now. You're moving the fucking gulp. No I'm not. Now you're moving the gulp. You just being woefully obtuse. I'm not, there was no dog. I left complex. If there was a contract that say complex has to pay me X amount of money over the course of the next 10 years, I'm not canceling it because of our disagreement.


I'm telling you something about me. Y'all speak for y'all. Not, there are plenty of companies out there where I have beefed with or had tension with or disagreement. Dumb people leave the fucking company, the company circle the block and have a conversation. No, I'm not living and dying of something I said in 2018. And that's the point I keep making about the fucking white people. Let me them white people negotiate. They use they words and they diction and they fucking get to the heart of the matter. No matter what the beef is, they gonna sit there and get the business done. I don't want to hear all this emotional shit from black people. There's nothing wrong. He ain't cutting gun off. There's nothing wrong with that. Joe He ain't cutting gun off at all. There's nothing wrong with that. Again, I can't, those are not real life consequential things.


That's, I wanna ask you a question. If, if the person, if the person that lied on you was under y was signed to you, you'll pay me for life. Listen, hold on, sign to you, the person that lied on you that you had to pay money signed to you. You would not still work with them Joe. You wouldn't still work with them on your understand what I'm ask question. Lemme ask you a question. Yeah, I get what you're saying but can you hold on, hold on. Can make your money off of somebody. That is signed to you without working with them. Yes. Yes. The answer everybody don't you? So you'll so hold I'm talking the flip. So now if That is true, I might not burn that contract up and say I don't fuck with you. I just wanna collect my money. I still might not personally fuck with you.


And ain't nothing wrong with that. So if That is the case, I'm not gonna go to the judge and say, Hey, I still want to talk to you. I would not have, I'm not gonna do that because I didn, I wouldn't fuck with you if that would've. But then he goes to jail. You go to jail. Do you go to jail for that? Because you can't communicate with the person through a third party neither. I'm never going create a situation where I got more options to go to jail rather than less. Yo, by I put him on the list. That is harder for me to go to jail. Yo. And that's all I'm saying. I can see why you do that. This scenario. Everybody come from different walks of life. Some people's walk of life is, if I know you rat it, I'm never going to speak to you again in my life. I don don't want, I don't want nothing to do with you. I don't want you to make no money off of me. I don't want make no money with you.


And there are some people in this world that will stand on that. I agree. I agree with that. No, you know what? I think cool. Leave it at that. You know what I do think? Stop. So I can hear all of y'all. You know what I do think to, to your point, there's also some people that when that dollar sign get high enough, they forget that. That's true. That's true. And a lot of people, when enough money is involved, we tend to forget that we don't fuck with rats. Both things can be true. Where were you going? The only place I was going was a lot of the examples you've given are from record Executives and business people and all these people, street organizations move different. Exactly. In this situation, situation where you got a street organization allegedly moving as a record company, not a record company trying to be gangsters.


See I think that's ka I think that's a myth. Not according to the trial. No, I'm saying they doing street shit. They've been accused of doing street shit. He carrying charges for street shit. I'm just saying he might move different This shit I'm talking about than a regular record ex. This is what I'm saying to you. We are the record execs today. We are what the record execs look like. When you start talking about Kev and Lu and Syl and all 'em, that's that's, that's behind the old guard. That's behind the thing. Old guard. Yeah. New guard. We are the brands, businesses and execs. And there's people that beef, hey when yo who was that that that sued epic over future shit Rocco. It's Rocco. Hey yo dog. Hey, I ain't really talking to him but I got this paperwork that saying him first two projects is mine, yada yada, yada, yada yada.


Send it, send it, send it. That's happening. If you, I don't understand what two projects, don't know what y'all are talking. That's happening. But I think both of these happen at the same time. Like for example, you don't necessarily have to cut the artist. That was just my example. I'm saying this nigga, you could legitimately say, I don't fuck with him. I'm telling the streets not to fuck with him. My people don't fuck with him. But if you make a record and thrive anyway, I'm still taking some of your money 'cause it's my my invest. That wouldn't make sense. Yeah, you could do that. Right? But that doesn't, but but, but this whole exchange started nigga that's very much cutting up your nose to, despite It is, and I'm saying there are people who would do that. A million. A lot of people, a lot of people do that. Those street figures that did that that do shit like that. And when you, and when you are worth, and I just had this talk with street niggas last week off air. 'cause that's who, that's who I am.


Yo, you don't have to do it this way. And what did they say? There's other ways to do it. It don't matter. Listen, my response to you is yes. 'cause I, I agree with what you and Isra saying. Those people exist when you're one of those people and you happen to be worth 20, 30, 40, 50, $60 million. When you make that decision, there's a team of people that's gonna come speak to you. Your accountants are coming to speak to you. Your attorneys are coming to speak to you, Kevin. Lows and the people that thrusted your career, the nigga that took the stand for you in your defense, It is coming to speak to you to say, Hey big dog, fuck are you doing? Take the advice. This is a different game right here. Lemme ask you a question. Lemme ask you a question. That's it. If Suge Knight was staying in trial and somebody was, and Suge felt like that person was testifying against him or ratting on him, and he was on death row.


You think Suge keeps stay, keeps working with him. You got damn right. And, and, and doesn't, and doesn't publicly call to do the rat and doesn't tell people not to fuck with him. Dog. I'm tell you, may, may, maybe Suge is wild enough to call the nigga a rat. Suge ain't nullifying, no contracts. Go to LA and ask around, ask around about Suge. That's, he's not nullifying no contract. But, and if you try to nullify it, nigga. But, but, but here what I'm saying, stop saying I'm not, I'm not dying on the nullifying the contract part. To me that's the, that's that was just tangential. I'm talking the main point was would you or wouldn't you? No. No. But would you go out in the world and still Carlos, do the rat even though it undermines your business interest? And I'm saying yes, there are a lot of people who run labels or not a lot of people, there are people who run labels who would be like, Fuck that guy. He's a rat. Until these producers don't work on, until this artist, don't fuck with him.


Don't do features with him. 'cause he is a rat. Even if I gotta a financial stake, I'm I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm saying we don't have enough examples of that for me to believe it. That's true. All of that jargon online and what niggas put on their socials. I don't, I'm from the I see the, I see the, lemme ask the opposite. Tell you truth. Lemme ask you this. When Kevin, when Kevin Lyes comes in my office and says, yo, we need you to do X, Y, Z. And I look at Kevin Lyes and I say, this is all speculative. 'cause we don't know what gunna did, of course said whatever the case may be. And we don't know how the abuse, but if gunna was played a part in me potentially getting life behind bars, Kevin Lows could kiss my ass and I'm not working with him.


Okay. We Got it, we Got it. Well let, can I just say one more thing to to KFC. You go on a cap on This shit, like whatever's going on. I don't like the fact that we're having this conversation. Me neither. Because to Flip's point, which was the best point, I want this brother to stay home. Exactly. And if people are talking about whether he's tweaking and deleting, if people are talking about who's, who's, who's a snitch and who's a gang, all that shit is not a good way to stay home. To stay home. You are involving yourself in more gang affiliation, a gang business. And That is the primary objective that the judge told you to stay your ass outta gang culture. Right. So I'm like flip man. I don't care if, if he tweeted and deleted, if somebody had his phone, whatever the fuck It is, shut that countdown. You, you should, you shouldn't be having, nobody should be having this conversation about you two weeks after you ducked a trillion years.


Thousand percent. A thousand. I think That is. And that, and that was my key point before we even started the conversation, bro. This shit that, that tweet means you still out here being active with the shits. Sit your ass down, enjoy your money, enjoy your family. Enjoy your friends bro. And enjoy your freedom. Your freedom, right? That's it. A thousand percent. Y'all better Look outside of this climate. Ain't a whole bunch of niggas selling 200,000 records. It ain't a whole bunch. And if you fortunate and blessed enough to have one in your stable and you still wanna be responsible with that, by all means have at it. I ain't the fucking all knowing Genie. I'm trying to think of the Matrix.


Nigga that fucking knew everything. Oracle. Oracle, Oracle. Yeah. I, I ain't Oracle. If that's your bag, that's your bag. It won't, won't be mine. You. think it full. Hey, every op out there, it was only two I let go unscathed. But the rest of you niggas is paying you crazy. I wouldn't give a fuck what the beef is about. Nigga shoot me. Ah, send one the first or the fifth or the 15th, whatever our arrangement is every three months. Hey, hey net one. And he doing 85 million. Not net 30, not net 60. Net night. Net one. He not doing when this talk is over cash, He ain. 50. Tell him need my money by Monday.


Yeah, he, yeah. Yo, I need mine. Send it one. Yeah. Nah, don't short me for mine. Fucking big T one. Oh Lord. Nigga, they gonna fuck you up. You crazy. Yo. They swear that all of us vote. They Trump swear was to because start with everybody else. No, it's your fault. When you said you niggas lied about your votes, that's all they needed to hear. They believed it. But you say, 'cause whatever you say, I got that from Aza Banks. I I'm telling you, why do they mess as whatever you say is law. So the fact that you said it, that we are, I know the niggas out there lied about who they went in that book. You was talking about us when you said this though.


I'm telling you, I saw the clip and everything. So when you said that, I knew it, that that's the response They got lot There is power in your Words. He, he does shit on purpose. I mean, you want me to pray for it to be the other way? No. Like think about it. That's, that's stop. Y'all want less power when I speak? No, no, that don't work. Nigga's families are affected by This. shit. Man, brother. Here we go saying I don't give a fuck about it. I don't care. I'm just telling the truth. Niggas, you gotta just stand on it nigga C Oe and say that man. What? Hey, go go to the kitchen it together. Get the big, big spaghetti.


Pot. The big one. There you go. Watch it. Watch this, watch this y'all. And just put it, put it right under that leak. Watch. Hey, I did. I did. Yeah. Hey, you ain't gotta fix it. Go ahead. Hey, get the big pot, the collar greens pot, the shit. Hey. Right under that leak lock I had to do a couple weeks ago. Go ahead nigga. You gotta pour that shit out every, every, every 10, 15 hours. Go ahead man. Hold the roof up with your hands. Goddammit. What We talk about Lift every voice and sing nigga. Yeah. Damnit. I fucking hate This shit. I hate This shit. How he stand on what he stand on. My man It is not about what? It's not about me. I just said I hate you. That's it. That's fine.


It wasn't, I wasn't trying. That's crazy. I'm with the beef. Alright, so we got our, all of our Young thug tics out. What else is important or unimportant? Important? I didn't mean to step on you. Go ahead. No, please. I was just gonna say Denzel Washington, man. They announced that he was gonna be Black Panther three to making a part for him. Yes. But then it's a rap. He said this is it. This is No, he say he is doing Othello and King Lear and Yeah, he made a run of movies. Yeah. Yeah. But he said that's it, that he's retiring. He's not gonna do anymore. But it was like 10 movies before. That's a, that's a lot. Good. Good. Yes. You think he's, you think he's passed his prom? No, I don't think that, I don't think he's pacified though. I think that our greats should have the option to retire when they feel like it end things when Denzel job is done.


Word. He's that nigga. Denzel's Denzel. He's our uncle. He did it all. There's no other movie role can. He did it. There's no more excellence he can achieve my, my selfishness. I agree with all that. My selfishness is that. I don't know. Nobody can replace him. There's No replacement. Aint y'all gotta replace Queen Latifah did. She did certain Equal saying fuck y'all. It is doing well.

But. yeah. We just watching a bunch of other shit. Get your head of man. She's up to like five or six. You don't watch it by yourself and then pretend I ain't good at that. I'm not good at that. Yeah, yeah. Nah, I got caught up before doing that.


Yo, we can be vague. You saw it. I've already seen spoilers so I really Don't care. See I'm still, I'm not, I'm not here to do the long deep dive. I only got one question. Well it's me and you, right? That's it. I'm with it. Why piece a piece of shit. Yeah. Why? Yes. The question is why, right? Yeah. Well he is a villain. That's so what the question is why? There's one question. No, the only question is why. That's it. That's it. That is the only question to be asked. The thing that made it a great season one made it a horrible season one. All like it's, that's a finale. Yes. Yeah. Also, it's eight. I heard that it's, well, it's nothing. It is, it's great. I mean it's not horrible.


It's great. It's great. It's not horrible at all. It's great to get but why? Yeah, the why. The why was don't tell me something happened to that kid. Man. The Y was the only thing. But what I'm gonna say is that's, that's character and that's what made it great. That's what made it. That's who he's been the entire show. That's who made it great. Is this selfish just all about himself Piece of shit. Yeah. That is how they've showcased him. Yeah. No, I think so. We can't get mad that that. I think it was conflicting. I think. I think he wasn't that. But he was that. I told y'all after I seen the first episode that this season should have lasted one episode. They caught him a million times seven and he should have been dead.


So now that that, now that the season is finished, guess what They did the whole season. Catch him and let him get away and he should have been dead. Yeah. This is a mini series too by the way. Yeah. What you mean Meaning no season two this Is no they're in talk season two. Shit. What ain Way they go. Are you crazy? HB not only are they in talks for season two, but Colin Ferrell has already said that the the new Batman movie Bat Batman will tie into that. Might be season in talks for season The Penguin. It's Been billed as a miniseries. Yeah. That's all Spanky out. You see the success so that Spanky come out. You talking about niggas won't, niggas will forgive the rat for some Spanky. Okay, carry on.


We the people decide what's a miniseries? There you go. And what ain't true? They don't tell us. We tell them shit. Your Honor was supposed to be a miniseries and they right back. And what happened? Silo was supposed to be a miniseries right back. True. Okay. What's that? Other, other weird Apple. They got movies to sell too though. So there's a slight distinction there. They not selling no movies. It's over the movie business and Nike is over. Not for Batman movies. It said, they said Disney shit is down on Disney stock. Warn Warn Disney and Nike. There needs to be a study on what happened to them. They said Disney shit is down. Nike. I could tell yo no dog. Listen, I never thought I'd be alive to see a day where Nike loses the impact that it had my entire life.


The designs are trash. All of the kids got all of the young kids, all of the athletes. Thes are trash. It's New Balance. It is Adidas ass. It is Crocs. Everybody back. It is Asics. It's everybody else. They got comfortable. I hear at the top of the game, you get comfortable and you think that you ain't going nowhere. The rest of 'em start creeping up on you. But you at the top of the game, you don't even see it. Are they still at top of losing market share? Or they have they actually just fallen out out of the top? No, no, no. It is bad. Really? No It is bad. All this hot shit. But the Batman movie grossed $775 million. True. So and guess yes, I understand what you're saying but Oh no, we not talking about Batman. Oh okay. But you know how much that shit was trash. But you know how much money Warner's losing.


You see what they just lost for Joker and all this other shit too. Yeah, that was a good, A Whole hole. Yeah, that Was a good to the point where they just announced that they're making 10 Batmobile to sell for $3 million A I saw that. That Last bat Money. What You think it is more valuable eight series, eight episode series or a movie Black. If We're pushing it, blockbuster Batman movie here. If We're pushing, listen, hold on. If we pushing everything to subscription based models and I want you to sign up for Max, Which don't generate money. No, but if I could sell seven seasons of This shit the way that this was written, it's a fight. Yeah, I'm not, I'm not maybe 7 75 or 7 75.


But it's a fight. If I could get six, seven And we got three of these on deck, I could get seven seasons outta this plus merch plus this plus that. Why is It you get the same shit from, but why is It either or? They do. Why isn't it both at the same time? Which is why question. Which is why they, he said they're in talks for season two and he's already, and he what? Shot five scenes for the next Batman movie. So It is both. We are gonna get a season two, which is further in just about Penguin and he's gonna make some appearances. The Batman, I think they need to go ahead and give him his Emmy right now. Oh he's killing it. Oh, I think he has it. That's in the bag. They sent it to him. Bag my My next question to y'all, to those of y'all that have seen a little bit of The Penguin, who's the best actor?


The girl is great. Yeah, Everyone. Everyone's got a great, I'm not going, I'm not gonna, yo that girl is great. He's great. Just 'cause we're Vic is great. He's acting so good where we don't even know that that's like, I forget that that's calling Ley Shorty's. But shorty is smoking in this woman. It is great. The mom is great. Vic is Great. Who's Vic? Oh the the black kid kid. He's good. Some might best somebody that shorty might be the best actor to me. The the girl. She's the girl. The girl is great bro. The mom is great too. I think I have the girl too. She's playing. The mom is putting on the clinic. The mom is great bro. That's true. Wait till y'all see last episode. The mom is, the mom is killing shit. Mom is putting on a clinic but so could I if I'm a vegetable that's not, come on.


Spoiler man. That's not, that's not nice man. What the fuck. But even though, but prior to that, what role y'all think y'all could kill in a show? I'm going with Vegetable for me, Christopher Reeves. Sorry. The dad that boogie rest in peace going to the store. I'll be right back. I could be, I could be the dad that boogie too. Nothing. Nothing. No role of mine would be positive. God an idiot. Anybody else got one for them before we move on? Nah. No. No. Nah, nah, nah. Let's see what else. What else? What else?

Talking about them two. No we won't. Let's over for that. Okay. Text about it. Hit the blue check. Let's see, let's see, let's see. While we're on music, do y'all wanna talk about the Doshi hate? Sure, sure. Yeah. Doshi got nominated for a Grammy. Everybody started hating calling our industry plant. Damn. Pretty much. Album was amazing. The album's great. That fucked. Even that album was incredible. Saying, everybody's saying that the album was great. It is been paid to say it or ain't, or just trying to fit in because it's, it's it's, you can get paid for say album.


Yeah, I would love to get paid for say of course Send me some bread worth. Like it's, it's, it's not, you ain't busted down. You your traditional I nigga we gonna jump You joking. Y'all don't use the, utilize the platform in the right way. And while I'm joking, just know I have never taken one red scent to give an opinion on any artist anything. But have they been offering Fuck yeah. Yeah, I've been offered principle. The real principle. Yo. That's the thing about principles. Real principles. You can't see it. And when you Got it, you ain't gotta just keep saying fucking lying ass niggas. Stop. Man. Niggas are lions. I don't give a fuck. Niggas ain't lying man. Niggas, some are, some not y'all.


Yo, what's wrong with when you came in the, it went out when Moon hit your eyes ain't gonna pizza. Alright. Nobody cares about whatever the fuck I was just talking about. Nah, don hate. Yeah. It is just, It is It is just people just talking shit. Honestly, that's what happens because she's not commercially successful and a lot of people didn't know who she was. So to them it looks like she just popped up outta nowhere and is getting all this love. And she, she's worked well affiliated With that side of course. And this side of course that side course. So anything, anything this side does that's successful is gonna be looked at with a Yep. A grain of salt. How real? And They're allowed, how real is the industry plant thing? Like when you're experiencing Oh, some of them.


No, that's a real thing. That's real. That's a real thing. But what happens is don't know if it matters. It is so incorrectly used today because people call anything that they didn't see from day one, A plant. It could have been happening over here. Just not in in your wheelhouse. You just didn't see it. Do She's been grinding. Yeah, but out multiple projects. Grinding, building her, like putting her time in to get to this point. She's deserved this. But because again she was under the radar for so long. A lot of the people who only watch mainstream and numbers I got you don't see it. So now when you pop up to them, it's outta nowhere. Oh, you are a plant. Somebody put you here. No, some people really work hard and earn they spot is It.


Is it? She's one of 'em. Is it inappropriate to ask you who would be an example of an industry plant? Didn't they try to say four bats was the industry plant ice? They tried to say four bats was everything. Most of the new acts they say of that. Okay. Most of the current today, if you got your deal post pandemic and some during the pandemic But. yeah. They say you a plant. They said Jack Harlow was a plant. Yeah, they did. They did. Tommy Richmond. Ice Spice. Yeah. Tommy Richmond. Four bats again. Four bats they said was a plant. Gotcha. They said four bats was AI at one point. Yeah. That's wild. Yeah. I said it shit, I remember, hey, if you got a hit song and I don't see no no club or show appearance, I think it's fishy.


But he proved me wrong. He was a human. He started taping himself, being a human. I was like, all right, you got me. He went and got somebody and said, all right, we got about these rumors. I think I asked Larry Jackson, Hey, is he a real person? Like yes, that's my artist. Thanks for supporting him. I love when niggas hit me with the thanks for supporting somebody that you didn't support all the way. Like, oh, they missed that episode. I'm not talking about Larry in four bats. 'cause I actually did support him. Nah, he they they just giving you a warning like nigga let your next, the warning goes different. That's what Kevin Lyes did to me with Meg. The warning is different. The warning is, yo my brother, I'm so proud. So proud of where you took yourself from man. Just know we hear every single thing that you're doing man. Every all of it.


And I may not agree with everything, but you really starting, you're starting impactful conversations that need need to be at That. is we right between the lines on all little love threat. That's a threat. Little love threat. That's a threat. Hey nigga, I hear what you saying about my artist. I'm letting it rock for now. Don't get crazy. She here to And you my man. That's what I'm saying. In this business he can only familiar. It's hard to have friends in This shit though. Ain't no friends, but nah, but some niggas can you consider friends if a nigga's there for you at a, at a time in need. You consider him a friend. Some niggas you consider friends and it's hard to have friends in this industry. Y'all niggas keep trying to make friends in business. No, but y'all niggas Ab at it.


You a hypocrite then have fun because you got business with your friends nigga the business comes first. I don't, I don't, I don't know. I can't. I've said that a million times. I can't can't. So that I'm clear love and I separate. I love friendship and I love my friendships. Yes. The business comes first. Of course you'll put your business first, but you also value your friendships. So what I'm saying separate. No it's not. Not when you work with your friends, it's not separate. That is totally separate. Not to separate convers conversations. You guys honestly feel that. Listen, listen, listen, listen. That explains a lot though. I was just giving you took the words out my mouth. You say that explains, that explains a lot. What? What you mean? Their contention. Your contention with each other. Yeah. Yeah. Well I didn't even know I had a contention with him. I don't have contention with him. Well I love him.


Well whether it be for just for I'll fire him and love him. What the fuck are y'all talking about? So here's the thing. I love him. Here's the thing. Not necessarily you. Yeah. He don't have real contention with me either. Oh. Oh, I don't know about your side. Tyler sitting there real quick. Wait, maybe where No you guys, you guys definitely have some spirited conversation is what do y'all say things and try to move on. We not doing that. No slick talk. Everybody's pause. Everybody heard? Yeah. First and first and foremost. I've never had a conversation with Mel about any contention with anyone. Facts me, Trevor facts Queen Flip SI don't ever talk like that. Second of all you saying, you said that that says a lot.


Yes. It may say a lot As far as what, how I conduct my business. I don't have, I don't do business with friends. That's not what I meant. What I, and with him, with him, a lot of times when I speak to people and I told 'em this over the weekend, web nitty, whomever, it's extremely, it's, it's a story. They're proud. Like yo, I can't believe, hey this nigga how this nigga came up and he put his man on that he knew from for a long time. We look at things like that and we praise that. Wow. I may not be at the level that he's at or the mental thinking. I do think that he, he appreciate his friends. He always said the business come first. But I do think that he would be a a little more lenient to me. Like I would be a Len like a little more lenient until you really push the nigga to over the, you know, push the nigga over the edge.


I think he'll be a you my man. So I'm gonna be lean. I'm gonna tell you this, I'm gonna talk to you. 'cause if it was another nigga, I wouldn't have this conversation. If it was another nigga, I wouldn't give him this warning. Yo. And a lot of niggas do that with their friends that they put on two things. We not gonna act like that. Yeah, I do two things. If you are affecting the bottom line, that goes differently. I agree. That's one. I agree. Then you're not a friend if you're trying to affect the bottom line. You don't have to try. Okay. Before you could be doing it. He could. I could put my friend on because this is my man that I've known for years. you right. And this ain't working. He's fucking up the bottom line. Which is where the business comes first. Got it. We could still be cool but I can't work with you because you're fucking up my business. True. You're not fucking up his bottom line that, that we know of anyway.


All the antics, shit, all that, that helps the bottom line. Right. But he don't sore. He don't think so. Does he do? He don't think so. Does he do? That's not what he told me. He don't think so. If This shit wasn't working, I couldn't pay Mark. You crazy. You know how much more money Mark make? I think it's great. I think it's great. I'm joking. Listen, listen. I'm joking. Stop. Hey point. Lemme finish Point. My other point was where I wanna say something so bad in terms of the got a headache. Look in terms of the friendship. In terms of the friendship with business, like you'll say, yo, I'm not talking to nobody else. I wanna talk to my man. I did say that before. Yes. That's not typical business.


You are putting the friend and that's where we say you holding the friendship. That's what I was talking about. Affects the business because anybody else does business a certain way and that, like I said, me and Joe are friends. Yeah. I have never had a business conversation with Joe and I never will. I mean he tells me that because I don't want the business to affect the friendship. Allow me to respond to you. Go you my best friend because I gotta I gotta be careful because I don't want to, I don't yo, I don't want yo niggas that whole reply. come on. Can I reply to that love? Why can't reply to that love? Yeah. Yeah. Yo niggas that do that, like you Parks yo yo my best friends Yo Bs, yo niggas that could be friends and not talk about none of that shit.


And they go to work and not talk about the friendship. Oh Chefs kiss. That's just fire now go ahead. I love you in Parks. You think that? You think that's cool doing that? You bitch ass nigga. Huh? You always do. Listen. I do. I do agree with that. And and he consistently tells me about that. I just, I just look at things a little bit different and I don't wanna take away from anybody else but me. I have, I got my own shit going. My own operation and my own journey. I'm, I'm more appreciative and I want acknowledge that. Not saying nobody 'cause everybody have their own shit going. So I'm not throwing any shots. But in my mind, my mind is one track when I see things with me, I'm so rambunctious when it comes to authority that there's only one nigga that I may listen to.


So if this nigga doesn't speak to me, it's like a temper tan drift. If my man don't speak to me and, and and and show me a different way in the conversation, then I'm gonna burn this whole shit down. Not here. But I get what you talking about with the high. I don't wanna speak to you niggas. Fuck you niggas. I don't wanna speak. You're not understanding anything that I'm saying. I don't give a fuck. That's how is it Right? No it's not. 'cause a lot of people like that's not right. Even my man told me to speak yo nigga, that's not how you do business And you couldn't. And I accept couldn't do that if he wasn't your friend. You are putting Exactly. That's what I'm saying. Shit higher than the business Right. Is what we saying Got it And that's obvious from the that's it. I'm a new person. I'm just saying from the outside looking in. That's what it looks like. It you can't do that at a company where you don't know the nigga running a company that you're doing business with, you can't do it. I told him over the weekend, it was be a one sentence email. He said that he would get, he said that it would be real brief.


He was very honest. Hey thanks for everything clear your lockdown badge two s go comma going on complex emailed me. I was on my way to work. Wow. Hey turnaround about pace, you can take it at all. I like that them bring in fucking stars before I get legends. That's where you gotta be careful. I like to, I like to be rebellious and rambunctious when the company does not have their interim plan ready to go. No, but you always gotta operate with any, that's just any company that they have an interim plan.


The one monkey you gotta bug out before they get it together. Y'all So ice. Where does that come from though? Ice? Where does my, my thinking come from some hood shit. Some immature shit. What? It's a combination of things. It's a combination. Okay. I never worked, I never, I'll tell you never worked a corporate job a day in my life. That is a major part of it. Yeah. That's a major part of it. You don't understand corporate structure at all. 'cause you haven't worked a corporate job. Got it. My wife and my son would just tell me that and probably will never and probably will never. And there's nothing wrong with that. But it's just the way you approach certain things is a little different. You think that's nice? Yeah. What you gonna do is make me go home and think it Right. You that nice. I'm saying as a creator nigga, I I'm never working a corporate job either. Yeah. That ain't y bad a corporate job.


Yeah. That's not, y'all think y'all ever have a corporate job? No. I wouldn't ever have a corporate job but I, I love the way you guys think. I look up to that shit. I go home and I, and I, even though I talk shit, I analyze that and I implement it in how I do business for myself. I'm a hypocrite bro. A big one. I do shit but I like, I do shit but I don't want it done to me. And that's it. And if you do it to me nigga, I'm gonna go crazy. Be be professional up here man. True. And I, I'm, I'm learning. I was professional today. Every, everybody just be professional. We have a good time and we can still be friends and it's a team thing 'cause these niggas put up with it. These niggas not really against me. They not even though you do that stupid looking shit. Oh let me look at, let me, they not against me and I appreciate that. Then that one time they said yo, this nigga's except I thought one person did but they didn't do it.

That's all. That's it. That's it. That ain't no beat. That's a valid reason she left with me. Nigga. He don't know you nigga. Everybody on the plate. He's a big fan, don't know you. How could he do that to him? What wrong with you mom? Nigga if I walk up to you and say flip big fan, but you got something fire and you standing next to somebody and I spit you to holler shit, hold up and you left that why you walked over.

If, if I was going to do that, I just wouldn't have spoke to me and I wouldn't have felt no way. If I saw you with, I ain't know you and I saw you with a drunk. I just wouldn't say nothing to you. He, he had to get a closeup. Yeah. See if she was his father that far the game. And he had to see if she IDed him and it, it wasn't like we was in the spot camed you up, nigga. I'm not five seven.

Plus he had to find out if maybe That was like, maybe that's just tell like your cousin or Your like, like I said, we wasn't just talking and we came in together.


It was obviously he might not have seen you guys come in together. You could confirm what he said. What's up to you. He saw you come with shorty. He didn't give a fuck. He tried his, he shot his shot. It ain't work. So I wouldn't taken person said, and I just don't respect if I, I ain't wanna see the nigga outside. I just don just don't respect it. That's all. So that's your story. He said, what's up to you and Yeah? man, shorty gave him a look and he's like, all right, let me, yeah. She ain't give him no look. Listen man. Oh you walked away. The wolves is out in Jungle Book. Man, fuck it. You gotta be, you gotta be a gorilla my nigga. That wolves is out that that just the game. I just never did that. Good. You a good guy man. Principal. Principal. Principal. Yeah, principal. I wouldn't, I wouldn't do that neither. But I should have huddle when you leave like on Instagram.


I could even respect that. This is before Has anyone, this is before Instagram though. It is long before Instagram. Has anyone here actually seen the Family Matters doc? Yes. No, we watched it. That should all you know. Well a different time I watched it. Yeah. On the Family Matters doc. I heard about some, he was in that. I think I might have seen a piece of it. Eddie. Laura and anybody else. Did they put a mic in front of said, spoke to their experience working with Jule White. They said his, his part wasn't supposed to be a real part. Yep. He came in, knocked it out the park quickly became a star and the centerpiece of the show.


And once that happened, got real buddy buddy with the execs and gave everybody his ass to kiss from. Why you parked in my spot to hey, can you do the fucking part Right or get the fuck out, you can lose your job. Stop playing with me on here. That's how they depicted Jaleel White on that show. I mean on the, on the doc. Very different from all the then I ain't doing that shit. Did we know about, and lemme lemme ask you a question real quick. How many other family ma Family Matters characters had a serial, a doll, a cartoon and all this other shit named after them? A show after that? Yeah, he was the draw. He was the show. So with that, that don't mean that you have to treat people a certain way.


Yo, we sometimes, sometimes we champion that shit. Shit. Yes we do. Don't understand. Sometimes we champion it. I don't think it's right period. But there are times that we champion it. That's why I Brought it up. I draw, I don don don let, so let's go through it. I don't think it's right. I'm telling you I don't think it's right. I don't think it's right because you a star to mistreat people I don't think should never mis mist people. That is right. Period. Yeah, I agree. Well hold up. I do wanna reply to you 'cause I agree with you. Sometimes we do champion it. I agree with you. But I I wanna reply to that. I would be championing this if Jaleel White left Family Matters and continue to ascent right then I would champion it. I bet you a dollar to a donut when he was going through that. I don't know what Wait, what? I. didn even heard That is the phrase the phrases slave black power shit to another level thought that was like in a movie.


Like When he was look, when he was being Urkel. When he was being Urkel and we remember the impact that that show had dog, he would've never thought that that would've been his last meaningful role. Right? So he was in the middle of his stardom. He didn't know that he wasn't going to ascend. Right. A lot. No, a lot of people could have forecasted that wasn't gonna happen because he was typecast. Because he was typecast like I'm a motherfucker. What I'm saying is him Wait, I don't feel like that's, how's that re agree with you? It is on you to decide whether you got the win in poker hand or not. No. You said yo, you would've agreed with his attitude if he would continued to ascend. I'm saying that he didn't know he wasn't about to be then you're not him fucking Eddie Murphy then you're not him.


But on that show he was, you not thought he was, that show is over and you're done. You are not him. You're no longer him. Yeah, he was him. He was him. We are not gonna say he You're not him. You were him. Stop, stop, stop. Then you're, listen let's, let's, let's talk. I know what Joe's saying. Let's have it out because this is, in my opinion, this is back to our Ghost 50 power conversation. You're not him. The people that wrote the character are is him. No, no, no, no, no. You going too far. You still had to deliver that character. No, we got that Paul White because again, you lemme talk. You also had to deliver after that character. Jule White. If we talking about Jule White and not the character, then it's your job to deliver after that as well.


Which he did not. How do you know though? That could also be because I have eyes and I've been alive. We could Google it. That's not fair. But do you That could be because he did the character too. Well I was gonna say, do you understand the process type casting? Like how Insidious It is and how stuck you get? That's y'all. It would be, that's why I told y'all I would charge close to nine figures to appear at anything Trump related because It is our job as him to decide whether you're being shortsighted and you taking a whole lot of money for some shit that's gonna long term affect your bottom line. So I don't give a fuck about that shit. Well, hold on. What was happening with one Family Matters, jal White job is to get shit cracking for even when the show was over. Look, look at Will Smith.


And he never did. Yeah. Look at Will. He never did. It is over. So when I hear the stories of Kobe, 'cause you're right, I champion Kobe. Kobe in high school. Was that Kobe at the All Star game? Was that Kobe? And every step was missing everything? Was that you that along the way? Everywhere you go. Same for the people that I hold in that high regard. I like arrogance, Steve Jobs. I like it. There's certain people I accept the arrogance from. If, if you cannot deliver past whatever that window was where you was delivering, then I don't want to hear that arrogance shit. I don't wanna hear it. That's me. But is he still arrogant now or was that arrogance in the time? So he was arrogant. Goddamn.


BET party. So was the show still on The air though? Might So here we have Jil White being approached by Netflix because the full House reboot was a huge success. Yes. Yeah. So now they stepping him about the Family Matters reboot. I'd like to play for y'all what he had to say. Time. No, let's bring it to the top. Somewhere around 2013, 2014, I was approached by one of our former producers that Netflix had interest in doing a reboot of Family Matters on the heels of Fuller House having done so well and check That didn't make any sense to me, asshole   I didn't feel that it was right for us to have to copy what Full House had done to fit inside someone's business model, to capture the magic that made our show make sense.


What I imagine for any reboot effort would be inspired by what really happened. How Family Matters came to pass is actually a greater story than what was made up inside the show. Going onto a show that was never intended for me to be the star of making it last for nine years, growing up on a studio lot and in public school at the same time, that to me was the greater story that needed to be told for today. When I pitched that to one of my former executive producers, all he had to say to me was, Jelle, nobody's interested in your memoirs.


But here we are, 12 years later, and I think there's some people that might be interested in those. Fuck your book, nigga. Nobody can hear your book. They're not interested. Own the book. He wrote a book. Yada yada y Fuck him. He he, they're not interested in it. Did y'all hear that clip the same way I heard it? Or y'all receiving a difference? I must How how'd you hear it? A difference. I don't understand how you heard It. That he really like didn't give a solid fuck about anybody else Involved. Anybody else said everything they said in that Family Matters doc sound like it still stands. Yeah, I don't like that. Netflix and all that. They are stepped to you about one idea, the reboot of this show, which includes other people. Your arrogant ass says, scratch that.


I'm not into that. If you do a show that's based around what really happened, which was my ascension and my ascension, only then I'm down. Get this nigga the fuck outta here. Yeah, no, that's, that's get him the fuck Adam. I'm sick of him Now go away. I could like Urkel and I could like Stefan and not like ju White enough of him. Yeah. IIII think your analysis is right on point. I, I think, and I, oh, I did see the doc and I, I know some people on, on the cast and they all say the same thing. I I think he is who they're describing him to be. And that's probably why his career didn't go everywhere. It could have gone in addition to the fact that he was just deeply typecast. And this happened before, before could be. And this happened in in the seventies too, with good times.


It was the same thing. They had a great family Black family story. What happened? Ish with Good Times. Yeah. Go ahead. Mark. Yo, you never gonna be serious. What It did happen with Good Times. I wasn't there. I wasn't born. That was these two niggas where it was like, it was like, we gonna have this story about this black mother and father in the projects who were trying to have this great family. And with, with Family Matters, it was about a working class version of the Cosby Show. Right? We're gonna have the Cosby show's here now we're gonna make a Chicago working class version spin off of Perfect Strangers. Same idea. It's about the family. And in both cases, JJ pops up, JJ got typecast. Right. JJ got typecast. And the Executives were like, these, the, the white people in particular love to watch JJ go Dynomite more than they wanna hear about the dad saving Michael from the, from the, from the Satan's nights, whatever the game, any of that.


Exactly. And then he goes to your head. And by the end, JJ had his own area. He didn't talk to nobody else. He didn't fuck with nobody else. And just like Urkel JJ ain't done shit since. True You know what I mean. It it keeps happening overly. They keep making these people turn 'em into monsters and then we'd be surprised at what the outcome is. No, they pick people. Well, that's not true because JJ had to roll his whole, they can turn into Monsters. You said he had the roll? Yeah. This nigga play. That's whole. He did Nigga Stupid. Wow. In what, what he saying? In one of the smooth videos that they were shooting at, he said they roll as Hove. Wow. They had him as Hove. Well, if in 1978 I had a show and then I play Hove in 2000. And what was that? That's a successful career right there. you know what I mean? Dripping with sarcasm. But, but Dog to, to your, to your point with regards to him, I was on board with everything he said until he said, yo, I was in high school.


I was doing this, I was doing that. So let's make it about me. I thought it was just, I thought it was just some creative differences that he saw or he had a potential idea when he said, yo, I was in high school. Let's make this story be about me and what I went through. Yeah. Kick Rocks. But I like what he said initially though. Yeah. Initially I was didn didn't because Full House, why We gotta copy them. The whole show was a copy. I mean, a lot of shows, a lot of shows are coming back and doing reboots of Frazier. Like a lot of really successful Shows. We don't necessarily have to follow their minds in the reboot. We're not coming to you as a writer, a showrunner, a scream. None of that's talent. Yeah. Yeah. Are you into this idea that, that that, that my board and the c-suite thinks is a fucking billion dollar moneymaker or not?


Yeah. Money maker. You're not. We off that next call. Cool. That is all it gotta be fucking Kel man. And you do is hurt. I can't say. And all you do is hurt yourself. 'cause now you fucking it up with the Hulus and, and whatever other brand. 'cause these niggas talk. So this gets out. They hear this, they know, oh, we can't fuck with him. So anybody that might have been considering doing something else or somebody might've been thinking about doing the Jilil White story or something. Now nobody's, I'm just, I can't say that because Macaulay Kin is on a run right now. Yeah. But Macaulay's story's interesting. Yeah, it's really interesting. It is very interest, especially the mic years. That's enough. Yo, that's enough. Yo, you good?


But even if that he held it down, you think Mike fucked McCauley? I don't think he, you said he held it down. Even if that, like he, I don't think he did. I don't think he fucked McCauley on, on, on Harriet named the General Electric. What the fuck is having, what, what the Fuck that Now I wanna know what is the, some shit about, oh God and I gotta know shit. It is not that deep on Veteran's Day. The US government officially named Harriet Tubman, a general in the US Army. In the Union Army. Yeah. Yeah. Basically it, it, you know, hundreds of years later. I just thought it was interesting, especially since, yo, are you fucking serious?


Go Trump. You said Trump did that? I said the president did that. Ooh, Biden. Biden. Yeah. Yeah. And really the US military did it. But he's goofy. But, but the point is, It is just an interesting thing to do for this woman. It's also weird for black people like hundreds of years later to get these awards. Like to me, if you're gonna do something for us, for somebody who's slave who saved enslaved people, she did give us some money. They said she was reparations though, right? You said what? They said she was like a slavery plant. Some people say she choose an industry plant. Oh no. Some people said she. Sorry, that was Rosa Parks. Wait, some people say what? Rosa Park was the plant. But not in a bad way. She just, because there was a woman before Rosa Parks. The plan is, and you think Rosa Parks was the plant. She was a plant before Ice Spice.


Yeah. But see Rosa was a, Rosa was a good plant. Ice Spice is a good plant. I ain't gotta say I, she might be. I didn't understand. I don't understand music. Well, now was Epic Ice Spice? Yeah. Bring, bring back. She said that's the gym girl. Bring back ice. That's true. It is, It is bring back ice buttons. You look like Pinky. All those girls is claiming gym now. Right. Just like people say they don't get surgeries, you know? Exactly. Exactly. Anyway, so yeah, Harry Awkward, awkward. Congrats. Alright, so congrats to Harriet Tubman. That's it. Tell him put on put on a $20 bill. Man. That's it, man. Yeah man. Big T ain't want to Big T named the Puerto Rican dude some shit.


His fucking chairman. Big T doing some shit. That nigga just like, oh, hey. All right. Hey, how that talk? The gun shit. The gun shit is actually shit. I'm not mad at gun shit, man. I'm at the, I'm sorry. Talk about it. Talk about it. Gun shit. Explain. He, he said there's gonna be automatic reciprocity for people who have concealed carry permits in other states. In other states. So like I have, I'm a licensed gun carrier in Pennsylvania. Same. So now I can walk, I can come here with my gun. Before you couldn't do that. Yeah. Like your shit did not transfer over. Right. I could walk. That's Especi. If you coming into a state like New York and New Jersey fire. Yeah. That shit was, huh? It is hard. Shit, yo.

Oh Shit Mark 20 years ago. Oh Shit. Oh man. I already know why we talking about this. The point is, we get guns now. That's all I'm talking about. We get, we get guns now. We can keep our guns now. I'm very happy about that. You serious? I'm gonna lie. I like that shit. Do y'all carry guns? No. No. New Jersey is just really getting the concealed shit. But you even at the crib, you keep 'em in the crib. At least they have it in no vla. We don't, don't think anything anyway. It's not illegal. I'm not, I'm not snitch. Yes. The fuck It is, It is illegal to have a gun in your house. Yes. vla. Yes. Why is it illegal to have a gun in your house? Because if you don't, don't have a registration for it. I didn't ask you an unregistered gun. I'm not asking if you got legal guns. I'm just Okay. If you, you ask it and we say yes, somebody might come in to check and see if it's registered.


I don't have any weapons in my home. Me neither. I, I feel like I'm, I'm protected by high power. Like my rosary glorious. I don't, I don't have nothing. And don't call, do a wellness check. Ain't nothing there. I don't have nothing. That'll put 90 million holes in. None of y'all. Oh. At a very fast rate. Real, real quickly, quick, fast. Real quick, quick, fast in that. And look, It is in that discussion. Look, recall. And when it hits your flesh it might explode. I don't have none of that. Yeah, don't none of that break right up. Yeah. I'm surprised. If my God don't got me, then nobody does shit. Huh? See, you don't walk with security. Neither won't do it. Why? How much more security? The Lord is about security. If God is on my side, he has security, I'm covered by the blood.


If the Lord is on my side, then why would I need stop playing security. Yeah. Your momma gonna hear you and get mad. Stop playing. Yo. Stop playing. Don't play like that. That's why I just don't go places where the Lord isn't present. I don't go to Cory house. I don't go places where You know what I mean. If the Lord ain't present you, I can't go. Corey be here.

That if the niggas the nuggets. I saw this. I thought this was old.


No, that was a different white woman that said this is not old. This is new. This is brand nuggets spanking new. Lemme cock it back one more time for the listener at home. Michael Porter Jr. Recently said, oh I don't like this. That if the niggas the nuggets, She's a white lady. Let, let me say this though, then I have to break up the team. Lou, are you buying I don't think she was saying the N word. I think she was saying niggas. Yeah, that's what I heard. Third because you Let's do it again. Third time listening for nigga, it's nigga. And I'm just gonna say as somebody niggas who, who reads prompter, sometimes you do just mispronounce a word. You know it don't usually come out as a slur. But I think that's just, I mean you're saying nuggets. Let me catch it again. See, listen. Listen for nigga, listen for nigga, nigga well help me.


What's a nigga? What is a nigga? What the fuck is a nigga? A t help me a baby nigga. Because you know more words than what is a nigga. Women do anything wrong. This is college for me. It it's, wait, hold up. One B one one B one. We got A one. B one ice mark. I'm saying a lot of times when I'm reading, sometimes you just mispronounce a word. It It is she wasn't trying to say nigga you you just saying like a word and nugget isn't a word that you might say a lot. You reading off the prompter and you just say you, you stumble. You just stumbled with mispronounce the word. I understand also, sometimes you forget where you at and you act. Maybe something slipped that you might not have said here that you may have said somewhere else. But if the word nugget is on, if the word Recently said, oh I don't like this, that if the nuggets.


The nuggets. Yeah. She was clearly saying nigga she's reading a prompter and the word nugget is written there. You think she saw the word nuggets decided to say, nigga that's not clear to me. Is it clear that she said nigga, the nigga is not clear to me is what I'm saying. I hear it. And nit is an in insult anyway. No, not nit nigga. What I'm saying is what's, she's reading the word. She's reading the word nugget and she mispronounced. She said nigga. Yeah like if she was freestyling and came, I might feel different. But if I'm reading the word nugget on a, on a screen and I mispronounce and say nigga like what? What else would it be? Mel used the word T Why is he, why? Why you blowing nuggets? Also Mark and Ericson, I'll send you this video to put it on the video.


It doesn't appear that she's looking at the teleprompter. Michael Porter Jr. Recently said, oh I don't like this. That if the niggas the nuggets, Even if the teleprompter did say nugget and she's just trying, she memorized the first line. That's her. Which her name? That's her. That's Michelle. She's reading Michelle Hoop Tell she's reading Michael Ford Jr. Recently said, oh I don't like this. That if the nigga the nugget She's reading. That's what I'm saying. The word is on need LASIK or something. Sometimes you just stumble on a word. Sometimes you do think nuggets and, and niggas, these nigga niggas, niggas love nuggets. That's why it's, and nuggets love niggas. That's why you know yo yo can't, whoa, you can't say that.


I did just, I said it. I said niggas I knew these words. Look how it happened. I would think that's racist. I think It is racist. I don't know what the words mean. So I'm bowing out of that nothing nigga means nothing. What I'll say to you is this Joe, I'm not, I'm not mad at at at, at Mark's assessment of this, my assessment and speaking for only me. And I'm not with Michelle Beatle doing that. I don't like that you did that or that. It sounds like she did that. But what I will say, I'm get the round of applause. Ready? Hell yeah. That is the best niggas from a white person I've ever heard.


You could tell that Michelle Beatle says this in her off time around the niggas. And that's, and she knows some niggas that's cool with this. I and that's why that was the smoothest niggas in the world. And that's I agree with on perfectly. That rolled up perfectly. It rolled off Why? The first time I heard it I was like yo, she comes. I was like that she bodied that niggas I don't like This shit. Shit like we ain't say. She said like what? She said it better than mail. Oh man I knew that was coming.

Just to correct the record, he 100% does not hear the rules when I say 'em. Oh yeah, he's, he hears, he said Fuck that guy. Hey that's why fuck with Flip. Does does anybody here care about Rihanna saying what we've all known already for those at home that haven't heard it industry right through music. I don't wanna hear This shit. She basically saying music was the entryway and now I found my true love and passion. So it's over for that. Does anybody care? No No's. Well we knew this. Yeah, we yeah, we knew you don't we salute to her head.


She's up. She think it a lot of artists doing it B and she's blessed us with a whole bunch of classics and she went out with a bang. I'm, I'm not, I'm not mad. I'm not mad anymore. Neither. I'm not mad. I'm, I'm disappointed. I'm not mad. A lot of these artists I I've said this before are have come into hip hop to use it as a, or just music to use it as a springboard. It's unfortunate for them. So lemme get in here. It is a unfortunate for some of them though. What you mean? Because some of them trash and they just think that they're immediately gonna jump from music to something else. Rihanna, NAS, Jay-Z's, you know Joe's Joe's the other people that did it. They did it and they tried to make the best possible product.


You understand what I'm saying? These other niggas like because their heart was in it. So what's worse? Someone that's really good that drops outta music or someone that was really bad in drops outta music bad because there's some people that like I don't need to, I definitely don't want to hear The record. We're not gonna miss True. No, I'm saying But you find, so I'll watch you sell The people that did music slippers and he did it for a long period of time. I think that they've earned their stripes to leave the same way Joe said with Denzel Washington. Like I think that he's done enough for us. He's blessed us enough that when he decides to hang up his hat, that should be his call. Rihanna's done the same thing. That should be her call. You get what I'm saying? Even though us as fans, we'd be being selfish but I just think that some of these other niggas ain't no Springboard nigga.


They supposed to pull a motherfucking trampoline from under your dumb ass. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Like like he said, some of 'em are fine. Yeah. And I'll still watch the You get this on, you do hip hop you mean fine visual. Yes, correct. Now because you're fine. You could use that to pivot off into something else. We never, we never needed your music but we would've never known who you were had you not came in through music. Yeah. And there's a couple of them s go ice that are now moving on and and having careers that they can sustain. I'm not outside of music. I don't gonna knock on nobody eat steak. I'm just saying.

No, It doesn't give it Away. An la apartment comp. An la apartment complexes are built on top of each other. And from my bedroom window a few nights ago I could hear the delightful sound of mac and cheese. I put my ear closer to the door this late night to confirm it was not someone in the kitchen. Late night snacking. I began to call out my window giving very briefly instructions like faster, louder.


And as luck would have it, the sounds became faster and louder. I couldn't see into the window that was making these noises. However, It is Pen house letters, ass fucking, However, it sounded like someone that lived below me after two hours sounds from both our windows became muted and I went on about my night. I'm still thinking about it and don't know if I should keep cont keep continuing, keep continue perusing and cat calling out my window, hoping for a good time. Or if I should follow the advice of the older gentleman and foul this under. Do not fuck the neighbors best wishes.


MKS Oh, all. I think this is a dude y That sounds Like it's dude. It's definitely a dude. This is a dude. Well, it could be a, it could be a And I still can't Tell hear the macaroni and cheese coming from the other spot. Well it can, it could be a girl. A girl could. Could a girl. It it does sound like a dude. It does sound, It sounds like a dude. We don't need to har Yeah. What are you saying, Mel? I Was gonna say, I can't tell who anybody is in the story. Well, mac and cheese implies mac and cheese. Vaginal wetness. Oh, you not beating allegations. She's crazy. The noise it make. Mel, What? Y'all don't make noise. Not Mac and cheese noises. Our penises don't make No you okay? I wore a Hoodie today. Mel You. all right. I'm, I'm sorry.

I can't believe y'all never heard of back anyway. Heard that before. Anyway. Anyway. Listen. My advice to a homeboy or what I'll say not my advice is, sounds like safe sex to me. Call me a weirdo. This is way more common than people think. My my advice to to fam this is way more common than people think. My advice to fam is I don't know who each other are. So I don't see the potential for this going left.


Me either, nigga. Like this ain't like, you might be disappointed if you go knock the door. Yeah. Like this ain't like where you smashing the neighbor and now the neighbor see you with somebody like you speaking to earlier. Now that's a problem. You don't know who this person is and they don't know who you are. So y'all can keep doing your thing. And and it's arrogant. It is arrogant of you to assume that you have the option of hidden because she let you watch her play with herself. And because she watched you play with herself, that don't mean that she wanna fuck you. But they're not even watching. They're not, didn't even, she can't, they can't see each other. They just listening. Yeah, it's downstairs. It's like full sex. This nigga's imagining shit. She don't even hear you. Oh, you're weird. That's all I'm saying. You're weird dude is a whole weirdo. Super hoardy. I'm talking about right When people live, when people live in an apartment complex with a balcony or if you're in LA or anywhere at Amond.


On on, yeah. You might could catch somebody that's doing that. And then you start and then y'all lock eyes and then y'all doing it together. I I've heard women tell me about that experience for them. And plenty of women are into watching men masturbate. So it's not as quirky and awkward as he's making it sound. He just did it weird. That's no doing it too. Doing it. The floorboards is Yeah, that's shit. My window open. Her window open. We can hear each other. You can't see shit. Not king shaming. Hey, got y'all. No, no, no. You business. No, no I'm not. No, no.

Because that shit is wet nigga. That shit is We. Talk about witness. That was you talk about witness pod Shut up. That was just said for dramatic effect. You. Oh, so you lied with your shit on your pod. I'm not talking About me. I'm talking about the story. Steve, off my shin. Don't don don't think he could have heard that She just done. Hold on. Fuck that Joe from a whole floor away. Oh, one floor. Yeah. Can we, can we stay with the topic at hand talking to Joe? I'm sorry man. That is, it's not about you. Okay. We are supporting our sister in our podcast. Every time you sexualize you include me in this Here. We both do it. Fuck.


I'm not sexualizing like stop doing that. You, you don't get me mad. Stop doing that. That got me in trouble too. I don't wanna get you mad. I'm I'm, I'm not sexualizing anyone. I thought that it was a topic and that you highlighted it. If it wasn't I digress and I apologize. Let's move on with this. No, not move on. Can anybody here explain to Mel how it's possible to hear the mac and cheese from like a floor away? That Shit was wet. Wet. So that's pretty wet if you masturbate. I could see somebody was hitting it and it was wet. Wet. You masturbate and you could hear the floor. I'm not the, I'm just saying dude must really be like pressed. That's all. I'm not saying am my, I don't know. I saw a 40-year-old version and Where the fuck Rocom? Yo, what you talking about nigga? Maybe y'all floors is thinner. I don't know. I I Oh, you got thick floors, right?


I'm a little uncomfortable. Nigga. Shut a shut. Little uncomfortable with that question, but I guess what I'm saying is I ain't never, to me the whole thing is dude just sound like a freak ball. Like, like, like he just really into whatever he into. And I wouldn't advise him to go try to fuck the neighbors. 'cause he is a weirdo and he probably gonna be, he, he gets stalker vibes and creep vibe. That's all true. Leave this at, leave this there. As as this is what It is. Y'all got your little shit, y'all fuck through the window. And that's It is it was, it was her thing too. Because jerk off it went faster and louder. It says him says. That's what I'm saying. I I feel like he's the type of boy that was like, oh yeah, I just happened to overhear it. No, he might've been like on some creep shit the whole time. Like ear to the floor just listening for, listening for shit. Or he might or he might have heard the you ain't got weapon. He could have just heard it. Yeah.


Nothing about this story. Don't sound like he a freak to me. He sound like a freak. He Ain a freak. And I ain't got no, sounds like a he could be a freak and not a creep though. Are you a freak? I yeah, I would say so. You heard someone big back and cheese to the floor Freak part of the issue, It is the creek part. Like I'm not, I'm not like sitting in my crib pretending to be eating food and then suddenly listening on the floor for, for somebody to be masturbating. That's what I'm saying. It seemed like the fuck I'm getting vibes from him. From the, from what you read, it sounded a little bit more than just a regular freak. What if he in the crib? It was, it was quiet. He ain't had no TV on, no nothing. And he heard it and it turned him on and he joined in from his crib. Nothing wrong with that. I'm just, that's not creepy though. What you described is, I'm just skeptical. I'm not, I don't, I don't necessarily believe that's what happened.


I'm skeptical. That's all because a guy said it right because anybody said it. I didn. I don't even know. I don't even think that's a guy. I'm not even convinced that's a guy. I don't know if it's a guy or a girl. I'm saying either way or any y'all any, just my final question on the matter. Maybe this is not even on the matter. Has anyone here ever masturbated to someone giving jerk off instructions? No. Nah. Wait say that again. JOI It's a Genre. Yeah, JOI. Oh jerk off instructions.

This Hopefully Y'all enjoyed this broadcast as much as we enjoyed delivering it to You. Peace, love, helped wealth and prosperity.


That made 30 K and one nine. No, that was the, that was the worst night. 70. But the 30 is what they pressing her for. Not the 70. Yeah, 30 was the light night. Like 30 is the worst. 30 is the light night. Yeah, that means minimum. That's the part they pressing her about. Yeah. I don't know why because people don't spend money in the clubs. They don't understand because God is a woman. I'm not doing it. You could do it at all. You could do it. I'm I pass. Y'all not by any evil. Yeah. I'm asking if nobody said nothing when she was here. That's why I'm asking. Let's, let's, I don't disrespect our guests. Let's get, I'm not saying you shit. I just trying to get, I really, I don't believe none of that shit.


Alright, so we got a no from ice. I'm assuming it's a no from Ish. It was a lot that I disagreed with, but I don't disrespect, I guess I respect's why shut up. No, from Ish. I respect it all. He is ignoring me. So I'm assuming it's a no flip No for you. I'll, I'll skip you just for content purposes. Parts. Do I think she was lying About the 30, not the 70. What? Wait, do y'all think the 70 was a lie too? No. No. I think she made 70 on birthday show. So YI do believe the 70 on a birthday, which just 30 on a Sunday. Not the 30 on A Sunday. On the slow night is where it gets. She said the worst night is a 30, which means the slowest of the slow nights. Anytime That is the floor 30. That means she worked never made less than 30. That's what no.


Says three days a week. No, she worked one day, worked day a week. I thought she said one day one. Oh. If That's the case a week. That's what I'm saying. I could see if you working one day a week. Yeah, 30. 30. If that's just set up, you couldn't do that every day. I wouldn't buy it. You couldn't do it every Sunday. I don't know nothing about it. I don't have no opinion. I don't know nothing about that situation. But you think it's all Ka. Okay. And we're talking about her when she's lit, right? Yes. We're not talking about when she's Under at their peak. Their peak. I could See that Same. Yeah, I can see it. I don't, I don't understand your answer. 'cause we, I tell you, I was there where? In Starlets on Sundays. I went to a bunch of them. You were at a bunch of them.


We've seen times where it was light. We've seen times where it was heavy. We've seen times where at the end of the shit, all the star tenders jumped up there and niggas threw money like crazy. Hey. And simple. It was, how many of 'em was it? One, two about Asha? Seven of Asha Lany s go, Gracie, Bernice Elba. It was a bunch of them and I can't see on every Sunday all of them clearing 30 bands. She didn't say all of them. I no, my thing is just the But the big payout, the big payout was when they collectively got up there, nigga just went crazy. You know what I'm saying? But throughout the, throughout the duration of the night, people was getting money. I'm not counting nobody. So she said her first night dancing, she made 30, I don't wanna sound not dancing.


I mean, excuse me, excuse me. Her first night working, she made 30 every first night. If you asking me what I think No, didn't that then, then It is debunked already. That's not true Because once they, I understand what you're saying. Once they became, I think, I think she averaged out. I do my my opinion is that she averaged out. I do do not think that every Sunday she cleared 30 racks. I think if she averages out, she cleared 30 racks every time she went to work. When you say my worst night was 30 grand, that means I cleared 30 grand every But you think our average, do you think our average Sunday is 30,000? Even if she have 41 week and 20 another, a lot of these girls know the outside niggas that come in and they throw money.


So it can happen. A lot of these women know that. Like they now do. I think she hit 30 a couple times. Absolutely. But not like on record Two times but not on average. They get the niggas that get money to come inside and throw money. I don't understand. And she was there Only Sunday. Not Friday and Saturday. No, not Friday and Saturday work. Friday and Saturday. That would be even better day to make bread. But she No, it Sunday's the night. Sunday was, that was the night. The night Got you. Got it Sunday rest of the week ain't matter. Yo wait, but wait, was this the time when perfection was open as well because it No, there was no perfection. It was shit was no perfection in club when perfection was open as well. That's what I'm saying. I'm be confused but I can't, it didn't matter. It was other clubs open. But Starlets was star. Star was here at that time.


If you came from outta town, if you came from outta town, if you was a basketball player, if you was a football player, if you was a rapper, if you were an entertainer of any sort and, and black or Hispanic girls were your thing, you were in Starling ba niggas would lead girls. You can't see it getting go two starlets. No, that's why it's just confusing because bleep this you, you've said on air before that you've seen get it rocking and if you believe that get it rocking, why wouldn't you believe that Bernice Got a rocking. That's my, I'm trying to shoot. I do believe she got a rocking. I'm I'm telling you that I just don't think that that was your normal day. I just don't think that that's your normal day on. Alright. My on average.


On average, I don't think average. What you think the average day was 10 to 15? Yeah, About average. I think that y'all and a lot of people out there have Bernice Bergos extremely. There's no disrespect to Bern. I'm not trying, don't think to you make 10 to 15,001 day a week. You are. I don't You're trying very fucking well, so half a million to seven 50, you're entitled to that. I'm not, I don't think that nobody's crazy. No, I want come off like disrespect. That's never, that's I I can see they're pulling up her other interviews where she gave a different answer. So I'm not mad. Lemme tell you this. This is what I do. Well, I count money. Well, and if you are making $30,000 a week times 50 weeks a year times three years, you made $4.5 million tax free.


And I know it's not tax free. Why do you say tax free? Because most people don't file taxes. Bartenders, they gotta file taxes. They don't have to or, and they file minimally sometimes. But what I'm telling you is I know what $5 million looks like outside. That's what I'll saying. I know what $5 million. That's a solid point. If you 'cause you getting $5 million and you getting taken care of, you ain't paying all your bills. You ain't doing this that dirt. That's a great point too. I ain't even thinking about that. I know what $5 million looks like outside. You do not think that Bernice Bergos has ever looked like $5 million? Me? No. Got it. Okay. I don't know. I ain't got no opinion. But It is interesting. This is, and again, I don't wanna sound like I'm, I'm I just, it's very few.


There's a bunch of people that feel like this so no, I but I don't want to like saying shit. A lot of them are being too disrespectful. Twitter. Twitter. Yeah. Yeah. Twitter is we New Yorkers? Yeah. It is different but like it's telling me he was there. I don't have a, I don't have a counter that we, we having a New York conversation. We having a New York conversation. That's right Joe. I don't know that many drug dealers that I know that had some money that look like they was doing. They just was $5 million up. I I could count 'em on my hands. That's a different type of money bro. That's a different type of look. And I It is just different that, that represents itself in a totally different way. I'm saying, and again, I don't wanna make, I'm saying just a conversation.


Well let me talk to, try to waver it on the other side so it factor same like that when factor look. So look and when you factor in other sources of of income, not income, other gifts or whatever the case may be. That's what I meant. You get what I'm saying? Like that's different Joe. That's just a different ballgame. Well you telling me and I've been outside for a little while, so, and you've touched money. Slow down. No, I'm not. I'm about to tell you we've see what, once you start touching that type of money, It is different my nigga. What I will say is this, and I'm not starlet any star starlet sing anybody to death.


I believe I'm only talking about my beliefs. So please don't counter me. I believe that the star tenders circa oh nine to 2011 or 2012 or oh eight to 2011, it's going crazy. Redefine, redefine the strip clubs in the country. A thousand percent. They did. I'm agreeing with you. They did redefine how they promote market hire, everything. The bars, the bartenders, the strip, they changed the whole, they changed. It was autistic courage behind models. It wasn't them. They changed how the country runs. Strip clubs one. That's true, but two, that's early Instagram oh nine 2010.


Like the time you talk about the time Bernice was killing was before they even figured out to bring all of them on stage. Like Bernice wasn't with all that. That they came, when that came, when they started doing they think tank. So how we supposed to do this with all of 'em, Gracie and all of them Elvin, all of them shit. Send all of 'em. But the time that Bernice was doing this at her bar, all of them came in. Everybody that you named came in there and it was a money battle. It was a money battle. You liked this girl, you liked this girl, you had all the money and you was gonna spend so this girl could give you attention. Here's where Bernice Burgos cracked him. Oh, they gonna fucking clown the shit outta me, but I'm doing it.


Everybody. Bernice kind of innovated, not innovative, but was a part of proving that the exclusive model works in strip clubs. I agree with that. Everybody could, you could only see this girl on Sunday, not no other day. She wasn't talking to you. She wasn't going fuck you, she wasn't going to dick tease you. Date you go, yada, yada yada yada y You could only see and communicate and get that bad drink from her on a Sunday. That's starlets at New York City. Specific. That's true Hours. So, hey, I ain't here to debate it. Even if y'all are right and she didn't I say she got pretty fucking close. I think she got pretty, she was doing, she was getting money.


The cars, the jewel jewelry and all of that while she was stuck on her regular You. know what I mean? We ain't Got it before. She said, you know, I had enough of you niggas, I'm out. I'm playing now. I'm playing now. She was, I know it's tough to hear in 2025, but you gotta tip your hat to that girl a thousand percent and the rest and the rest of you bitches that that came after it was just so accessible every day, during the week, every different club talking to every nigga on your phone, y'all bitches that had the two phones handling customers gotta fill the bar up. She didn't do none of that. She had a three year plan executed that shit. Got the fuck outta there and started the business. How the internet is, I don't understand it and beep that there's only even one have to go in there.


Alright, alright. I'm keeping, I'm keeping right. No, no. Your dog when she came up here was like you was throwing your thousand dollars. I saved, yo, let's move on. No, this was right. He checked it. Nah, he wasn't throwing no money. Nah, you wrong nigga. I saved, I was with that month. I remember that Nick for the stack. I was with you. We was in there every, every week though when she worked No, at that ball, but hold on. But you saved a month for the stack. We was in there every weekend. I saved every, yeah. So Yout have a stack every weekend. The time I had a stack for her every week. I had a stack for her. What year? Every time. What year? What year was every time I went in there? What year? Unless other nigga you had a stack for her every week.


I don't know what year. Oh, 19. Every week I, I went 12. These are days where I wasn't tipping. Yeah. I'm not doubt. These are days. These are days I was fucking, I'm not tipping. I'm going here, pulling him out, doing what I gotta do and I'm out. What years was he was this? We were talking 2010 talking. I can see how she could get 30. I'm just saying It is, It is a bunch of niggas that think like that. No, but I didn't, I just wanna say something. I didn't have no money. That's what I'm saying. Case and I saved to give her my stack. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Them niggas with money. I'm telling y'all when I went in there on her birthday, they was all in there. Yeah, they was in there. Everybody you could think of was in there. She had that with you. I would've thought that her highest paid day would would've been a little bit more but high than 70, right? Yeah. Yeah. Me too. Yeah, me too. Me too. Shout out to Bernice. Listen, Thank, you shout out to Bernice. We love be becoming New York, New York legend no matter how the rest of the world feel.


Alright, listen, this nigga's crazy. Me. Yeah. It is just, why? It's just, it's be crazy. I mean, shout to Bernice. She did her thing. Why am I crazy? Doesn't matter it man. It was to me, all those girls that came together, they were, they were, they were. It was part of a movement. Like while she did something exclusive, it still was gentlemen behind them like artistic curves that brought them together. I remember I was there as well. So like it wasn't a plan that she put together herself, even though she had mastered how she moved and I, and, and, and we can see that she kept the exclusive, like she kept herself realistic. I like that point. So even if I agree with y'all, y'all don't think she grossed that Growth.


The five mil Don't think You grossed. No. Whatever. The 30 grand Oh, gross there gross. It sound plausible. There go. It's plausible. It was a movement. It, it doesn't ible and it also might be the averages they put together a movement. It was so ill how it was put together. And she, she, she, she wasn't like everybody else. I, I can say that she did fine tune herself. But shout to Bernice. Shout to Bernice, man. Shout out to the rest of the star. Attend too. Old school Star s right? Yeah. You know what I mean. Yo, keep us in your prayers. Lord knows we need to be there until the next time I bid you with do farewell Adio Riva, dci OTA ais so long. Goodbye or simple head. No. We'll, suffice man.
