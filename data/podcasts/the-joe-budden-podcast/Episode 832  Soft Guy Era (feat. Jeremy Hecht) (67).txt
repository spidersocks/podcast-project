Somebody left for comment the other day and was like under pod wives and they said, yo, next season every episode of pod wives should just be shot in a different location like Jamaica.


And that's fine. That's fine, that's fine. I was like, you know what, as, as crazy as that may sound. It sounds like it. I don't think that's a bad idea. It is one a month. Yeah, roughly. But I mean, even if you did it every other month on the fly around tip, do it that Way. Yeah. That's dope. That's kind Of fly, that's kind of fly super dope. So I'm not all the way opposed to that, but, but my brain is working. I'm glad that your crew found something that's fly to do like this. No. Yes, no, It's fine.

This is not the, this is not the Melyssa Ford show. Thank you. Very hot coming the station near You. Right. Gotcha. Wayne, Wayne, Little Wayne's album. Let's start, let's get right to it. Yeah. No need to bull, no need to hook Pussy foot around. It Was late. It was late on the dsp. So this is a a, a common thread. I feel like we've had the conversation multiple times. Yeah. I stayed up till like 1230 waiting for it and it didn't show. So I was like, fuck it, I'm going to bed. It was a weird, it was a weird, even prior to the drop, like no single, no trackless until, yeah, 11, I think.


Well it, it went out like 1130, something like that. The actual track list. There was a fake one floating around. But we heard nothing from what this album would sound like, direction, just nothing. Oh. Damn. Near like a surprise drop. I thought it wasn't gonna come out. Absolutely. Well I was gonna say, yeah. Did you guys know about There was a reason for That? They had a release date? Yeah. Okay. He, he dropped the release date back couple Months ago. Yeah. During The Super Bowl. Yeah. Like right before the Super Bowl. He had an announcement to make and it was that the album was coming. We were like, damn, now even we came here and talked about it. I said, damn, that's kind of weird for you to just pop up with this announcement for your album. I will say that it's pretty fitting that there was no direction being presented in the public because there was absolutely, there's no no direction on this album at all whatsoever.


At all whatsoever. So I woke up and hit, you know, hit the social media streets and it was just shitting all over Wayne's album. So I was scared to hit play. Okay. I was scared to hit play, but I did naturally. And the first couple songs, I'm like, man, I think people are being a little hard on this. This ain't so bad. And then it made a turn And then a very hard left came right Until a brick wall, Maybe worse than a, I don't know what the brick, How many songs. Wow. I don know 20 something. Maybe 19 songs. 19. So I'm gonna tell you, I had one of the producers sent me five records. Okay. Early yesterday, like three o'clock. Okay. It happened to be like the best five records on the album.


Gotcha. So I'm like, all right, I ain't really, if this is where you going, okay, this, this could work. Right. I did See that that track list that was floating around was false. I'm like, okay, that was good because when I saw those list of features, I was like, I don't know if this is gonna fit the Carter series. Yeah. Like just reading the names. I don't know. Okay. But, and you get to listen to the album intro was hard. Like you said the first couple songs and then it, it just, it sounds like there was no, it sounds like he went through a, a hard drive of records and just randomly picked Yeah.


Or whoever did it. I don't, I don't know if it was him. If he had some, you know, I've heard rumors that somebody else was working with organizing the album. But whoever it was, it just sounds like this is just random records. All Yo, gimme that one, gimme that one, gimme this one. Gimme this one. Yeah. It covered different genres. There's rock records on here. Yeah, there's, yeah. I don't know. I don, once I hit the Bono record I was like, okay, we're we've gone too Far. And then when I heard the elephant, that's when I said okay. That was okay. Okay. I I this is not for me anymore. Yeah. When you say it made like a hard left, what does that mean? A hard left? 'cause when the first couple records are okay. Or even good. You, you kind of stopped your review after the intro was hard and began to talk about something Else.


Oh yeah, you did. Oh, I'm sorry. I was waiting on your review for you. You want like track by track? No, he said the first couple was cool. The first couple? Yeah. Like, Well what play one of the records that you think is a high. Okay. Remember, I guess, I guess that's what I'm saying. Got you. Like y'all are doing a great job at whatever Gregory Hines shit is going on right now. Of course. I mean he about to go to a show nigga, he about to go to a show that nigga, he, I hope he don't perform none of these records at the show that I'm going to All, don't worry. I'm gonna take it a step further in a second. Sure. I like the intro. So this is welcome to the Carter. When you say intro, you mean track two track, track one. Track one is just Yes. This is the actually Yeah, yeah. Got it, got it, got It.


Is what told me he didn't have money for beats. Yeah. Very Early. Track two, Man in my word, I stand on my word. Y'all get on my nerves. I get high and land like a bird. Respect. I don't demand. I deserve my standard family first, family second, family third. I, scrambling was hard. I treat fucking if I just added coner It, I like that. Nah, it was wrong. I like that. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. So you Don't need to look at me and say No, I'm just saying I, but we we we having a conversation. Yeah. I like that.


We just talking. Alright. I, I, the next record was a rock the bell's flip that I, I don't like to beat but he's rapping. Like, actually let me reply to flip. Oh. 'cause just we doing this, I challenge you to listen to the whole thing and see how you feel at the end. The Whole, that whole record. Yeah. Like that that it did sound cool by the end of it. I was sick of what the producer was doing. Yeah. With the beat. Yeah. Got it. And The hook, it felt like an AI sample thing. I don't know what that was. It's a, It is a far cry from Hey man, stink and he, it It is just, it sounds like just a hard ass SoundCloud beat.


Yeah. It's, it, it's contrived too. Like some of the dope shit about like vocal samples and vocal sample flips is like the flip part. How'd you get that? Yeah. How, and you took this and made it into saying what you wanted it to say. Whereas if you, I don't know if it's AI or if they had someone just like do some sample recreation shit, but when it's like too on the nose, it's not dope. Like we didn't sample the seventies records with the vocal sample just because of how it sounded. It was the creativity of saying, oh I could make this sample sound like it's talking about this when they were, maybe it was a love song or something. I Understand what you're saying. Whereas if You just put some, I don't know if, like I said, if it's ai, you put it in the generator and make it say what you want it to say. It sound too perfect.


You mean, Or it's not too perfect. It's just there's no creativity there. The creativity is in the flip. If there's no flip, it's So for example like style speed, I get high. Exactly. Got it. Yeah. Great example. Got you. Great Example. Okay. But continue Please. You please. We, we Definitely, I like the, I think the Big X plug record came up soon after I liked that record. Well the, The Bells record was next because I'm Okay. Go. Oh, we can yes Track my track. I don't mind. Oh hell no. Not for 19 songs. No hell well it's Going, I'm not playing with Lil Wayne today. Once We get to track six we can start to veer off the disperse. Yeah. Oh, okay. Nah. Alright. So Where do you wanna go? Go ahead. Gimme 20 seconds. All these shit run through with Fuck it. Cool. Let's go. Go Joe. Yeah, let's get this whole, because you about to take it further.


See it in your eyes. This is another one that I thought was hard for the first 20 seconds. Yeah. A IL Wayne is sharp as nails hammer. Anybody that talked that LI exhale push y'all smell Thugging says I got exactly s That Was a hard intro than the beat. The beat Didn't live up to the intro Parks. Is it that you find the beat two elementary? I guess.


I guess that's a way to put it. There we go. Pause. You can pause it. Okay. I, yeah, I guess it Don't, it don't got enough. It's not play in it. It is. No It is, It is simple. It is not what Bangladesh would've did. Yeah. No it's not. Even If it's the same sounds, it's not. That's what saying the swag is missing from it. Like, It sounds like a novice producer got Got it. And that's without me checking the credits. Gotcha. Yeah. No, the, there's no big name producers of note that I, except Manu Fresh did one way late in the album. That's the only big name I remember the clef record. Which, and, and, and let me just say, what, what track Are we on right now?


This is two, well This is three Technic Technically. Oh yeah, yeah. Go ahead. I like the big extra plug record. The Big I love the big extra Plug record to me. Sounds like a big extra plug record. For sure it does. So I'm not so mad at that. I like that. I love that record. The two chains record. Love that. I wasn't so mad at either. I Wasn't even mad at the like we will get into the terrible match genre mashups later. I wasn't terribly mad at the Jelly roll and Big Charlotte record. I didn didn. Didn't hate that. I like that one too. Oh, I was mad. Oh, I didn't, I didn't mind that record. I'm not mad At that play. A little bit of it. That shit was Cold play. A little bit of It is. That's the one with Jelly Rose on the hook, right? Yeah. I I I didn't, I didn't hate that. And, and Charlotte rip here I got you. I got two s. You got it. Okay.


The free, you could tell he ain't never had the S You know what I mean? You could tell the party nigga never said The exact opposite. No, I know. Shit. I can't go, man. I'm not mad at this Shark. I don know. If I would've started with the, I Don Dunno if I would've started with the hook. Definitely shoulda started This off.


Sound like he made this in the same session as this sound like the song he made before he made how to love this sound. Like something that should have been this sound like something that he should have sent that he maybe sent to m on the recovery album. Like, but a bad version of it. And he put out a album that I thought had recovery vibes. I don't remember the name of it. Rebirth. This sound like something that was left on the cutting room floor of that project. But I'm gonna rely on the Jelly roll. The jelly roll feature here. Yeah. That's, that's literally what a lot of these records I can, I'm listening to 'em. I'm like okay, this sound like it was leftover from here. Sounds like it was leftover from there. And what track Are we on?


That was five maybe something six. We skipped. We skipped four. We skipped. Yeah, That's fine. We skipped that was the Big X record. This is five to me, to me listening to it this morning. And again, this is off a couple of listens 'cause I did let it play just to make sure it was slowly becoming painfully obvious that this was not the same Wayne. See that? And I, I have, because I disagree with that. I have a different stance. This is not the same Wayne team. Yes. Is what I got from it. Well because he's rapping it's still the same Wayne. It's not the same Wayne. If you don't have the team, you're not the same. Yeah. For 100% your team is you. The team was my myself. I was getting to that.


But this is not the same Wayne that makes you question why is it not the same Wayne? This sounds like who the fuck is around him. Yeah. Yeah. But I came on here and made that point before you did this. Sounds like who is this nigga? Is the engineer nigga still managing him? He may be. I don't, I don't even know. I'm not sure. I'm I'm assuming so. 'cause that was only a couple Months ago. And that's disappointing. Right. Even with the Kendrick and TDE split Boy, did they lay a foundation for how the split looks when it went well, right? Yeah. Hey, I'm gonna still be around. I'm gonna still tweet your shit. I'm at the shows shit top still got me my tickets damn near. Mm. Like it's painfully obvious.


There's no Mac, there's no baby, there's no, I don't care that Manny Fresh is on there at the end for namesake. There's no Manny Fresh. Yeah, there's no Drake. There's no Nicki. Nobody's walking through that door. It is just a, a God level rapping Wayne. Unfortunately rap is 2% of facts. That's, That's the facts. Facts. Okay. See, 'cause that's what scared me too at this point in the album. Well, as it continues, I didn't hear like a proper song At all. I didn't hear a proper song with Regards to format, Format, arranging topic concept cohesiveness.


I hear amazing verses for the most part. Slapped over Amp beats. Shit beats. Then we get to this track. I Hear we Get to this travesty. Oh yeah. Well please stop. Please stop. Please stop. Please stop. I have to prepare for this was Emotional. This is, this is so bad. Was that like that? This is so bad. This is band new. What it sounds So a really, This is a song called Band from New Orleans. It sound like they chased that Mel. Yeah. Banned from It's a play on a song called Band from tv. That it's hip warrior song. It's a hip hop classic. You guys Are fucking hilarious. Featuring, featuring Big, big pun, nature cam Styles style kiss.


An absolute classic. I might ever heard The winter twice. We still don't know. Well now we have to play a little bit. We still don't know who had the best verse from this song. Still 30 years later. Yeah, 25 years. It's Whatever. And Lil Wayne 30 Is 30 Is a hip hop guy for real and a skateboarder. But he respects what band from TV is. Yes. He did the band from TV from the mixtape and killed It. Why? He decided to do band from no with that horrendous beat flip. Hey yo, what the fuck is going on? DJ Dell. Dj. Oh shit. I got you. All my shit is mixed tape shit. I know man. Oh shit.


Oh this is a mix tape too. Oh, there we go. S like I'm free holding your face in the palm of my hand. Blow you away. Like I gotta call it like I see it talking how I be walking my walk th down orthopedic because I'm soon to be up, gimme room, watch me heat up. Niggas try to stick me like a do. Follow the leader Let's GOPer for the nonbeliever.


I get pussy with my father's features. Puff Heavenly. See me at six. One way above 70. You said that shit like It was bro. Niggas will knock you out Nate. But in the song it don't even, man it don't matter. See Me at six one. Where bro, queen day man, 98 live. No, we play Make God dance. Woo. Champagne Enough. This might be the best. This might be the best arranged lineup in a posse. Cut. Yeah. Not bad at that. They smoked. Who went first, second, third, fourth and fifth.


They absolutely smoked that. Anyway, back to trashing light now. Yeah. Yeah. Now we gotta go back, Back the club. Give him a little bit when we go back to the back of the club, You know what I mean? You can really hear it. You know what I mean? Before I let go. Hey, yo. Cocaine lighter. The rope chain brighter. The choke chain tighter. The close ring sniper, the dope gang lifer her throw gang nicer. The propane light. She action scream cur. Wait, hold on. Okay, wait. That was fire but not the beat.


What the verse, what he was saying was hot. Yeah. The verse is a fire. And he did say that what he was saying was hot. But that what what that was that a 8 0 8 that came in? Yeah. What the fuck? Who put that in there? This sounds like so far in the project, this sounds like somebody that went to jail Came home from doing 30, Wrote constantly and came out to place these verses. This is like, this is So, so wait though. If, if he's doing elite rapping and then just the arrangements of the beat, we can't take anything away from him. Yes you can. Yes, you can absolutely pick beat you Absolutely can it all. It all falls on the rapper.


If your publicist does a bad job, it falls on the rapper. If the a and r does a bad job, if the producer does a bad job, if the marketing team, if the video was whack, if the director sucked, if your team is trash, it all falls on the rapper. That raping though gave me hope that Nope. Nope. Nobody said yo nas pick bad beats because his a and r just something What I'm Saying, they said Nas picks bad beats. It always falls on the rap Person that Form. Yeah. I thought it wasn't fair Either. Yeah, it was a little, that form of rapping or how he sounds, gives me hope that he can put out great music. It's still potential. It's not he, I don't feel that it's over by hearing him rap like that. It's not like, damn It is over when you hear some other guy That's that He still giving me hope. Like, okay, I'm gonna go back.


I'm gonna hear Joe podcast. I'm gonna read the comments and I'm going to show them. That's what that gives me. Go find. I take that I'm Gonna flip. Well that's why podcasting is great because we get to hear you guys' review in real time. So Got it. Cool that you feel like that after track eight, all of the stuff that we've played, being respectful as we can be. I know we all, we are, but I that We trying to have all the grace for an icon. Yeah, A legend and a great, so Can you play the bad shit then, Joe? Well, it Just keeps going. Oh, can you play the bad shit, Joe? So you can, so here's the thing, And I'm not trying to convince you that It is bad. No, no.


I have value what you're saying, but I just want to hear like Yeah, but look, you saying the bad shit, right? Like again, he don't, Wayne can rap. Rap. We know that. It is, It is. There's no question, no debate. But if you're rapping at a high level and the beat is still bad, it makes for a bad song. It makes for a bad listen. And another thing, It ain't even just the beats, you could tell he can't make a hook no more. Okay. Or he just needed help Or, or he had a lot of help. Your team, your team. That goes Back to team. Th the, it ain't a bunch of good hooks on here either. No, sorry. I Mean It is Bono and jelly roll. Like it's not like it's fucking people can't make hooks. Yeah. Go go back to his discography. Go back to some of his out where, where his hooks were either features or Samples or Yeah.


Yeah. This is, He ain't been hooked man. Does this sound rushed to You guys? Not like, no, no. Rushed or Like lazy. I don't, he's lazy either. He's lazy. I think it's just bad production. A r essentially. I think there's a, 'cause I, I see your point. There's a huge dip in quality from go DJ and miss officer choruses where you could tell there's help or the sample or even when the beaches go something you forgot. Bitches Love me. That's all the sample A milli even to what is happening on this project. There's a huge dip in quality. And again, that goes if, if you, if you skimmed it on the beats and you skimm it on a producer, then how could you rely on your vocal sample to carry the chorus?


Mm. If we have a problem with the beat, how could you rely on no vocals and letting your beat rock and that be in your chorus? If the beat is black, it's not gonna be a pleasant Listen, regardless. That's it. And the other thing is these records are too long and I, I hate that. I mean to say The album is too long, but look At the, look at the lick. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I thought we wanted long. When they're good. No, I want it when they're Good. I want him to stop. I don't, I want him to stop. I see, I see. You're trying to be respectful and I see It is he's trying. I see it and I'm watching you. Like I wouldn't be mad at, I wouldn't be mad. I told these two niggas months ago when they told me Wayne was in his prime or whatever variation of said I Remember the conversation.


Yeah. We didn't say, Well whatever variation. Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah. You right. You right. They sampled this when you're on Say what? How did that get allowed? Who? It sounds Like there's nobody checking manager. Or maybe he wants that to up on the pop charts. Maybe that No you don't, if you didn't have money for Beats, you don't have money for pop charts. Yeah. Yeah. You think Wayne is relying on legacy at this point? Like, like my name alone is enough to get it done. I think that Wayne, much like m and maybe, I don't know a bunch of other martians like this love rap so much.


They, I think that he just love rap and is gonna rap. I agree with that matter. What matter. And I'll throw in the caveat. I I think both those gentlemen and specifically that you're mentioning, em and Wayne don't leave the house. Yeah. They just want to rap yo Like you have to go live like a human being. Yeah. In order to make something that human beings are gonna, They play words and similes and man boards and entendres who cares about the Hook Really? You can't compare them. And because at least with m his last was, m is his last two projects were great. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. He, he still, he still makes a good project He's making, but he'll produce. You get what I'm saying? He has a team. That's the difference. He gets with's the That's what I'm saying. So I don't, I don't even compare the two.


It sound like Wayne is just rapping whatever You send, whatever you put on. I got it. I Got It. Is I can rap. It Is Wayne need to go and just, you Think it's a money thing. One, two, I don't wanna do that. It Is, It is it, I don't wanna do that. I can't do that. I'm not gonna do that. I don't Is this freeze? Is this self-inflicted? Right? Is this a self-inflicted rule? Meaning that, is he intentionally avoiding going around a team? Didn't Wayne sales pose? I'm sorry, flip. Didn't Wayne sell hundred Million? He sold, he sold, he sold a, I Thought he got bred back from Hundred million From over there. I think Lil Wayne should have a lot of money. I think that he's got, especially if he got, he broke Bri all the people that was taking some of the money. I don't think he's worth, I don't Think he's Okay, so, alright. So the reason why he's by himself is because people were robbing him according To him.


I, I don't know that, I don't know that business. Got it. And To be clear, if you got Big X plug, who's hot right now? You got Jelly Roll, you got Big Sean, you got Bono, you got fucking Clef and the opera dude, like this wasn't the cheapest of albums. I mean I'm sure it's a lot of this comes on favor and strength of I was about to tell, yeah, I don't know him, But still Bono. I don't know if Bono's just like, yeah, I'll give you a joint. Nah, I Disagree. He's not Nigga a Skip Baylor's house. Yeah, I don't know. He Definitely rode over, skateboarded over to Bonos. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe you left Skip Bayless and, And went to Bonos and I, and I think Bono is at a point where I don't gotta do it for no money. I'm doing it 'cause I fuck with you or, 'cause I think I'm, I'm a fan of yours. I think that you're taking hip hop ethics and mentality and applying them to generational pop stars that maybe Bono would feel that way.


But I don't know that whoever runs Bono's business feels that way. If y'all want, if y'all wanted Bono and he was charging you more than was in your budget, but you had it personally, would you pay for it personally? If the record was absolutely fire? Yeah. In this case. Would You have this record? No, I would not pay dime for this record. I would say Bono Thank you. But no, Thank you. I don Love it. Not for that record. Also, if Bono sent over something that wasn't heat, would you tell Bono that? Fuck yeah. Yo, big Dog. Hey Bono, don't you. Lemme come. It's sucked fast. I, I'm gonna fly up to you and let's, let's work on this. I It is a good start. It's a good start. Bono, I'm, I'm not telling Bono that I'm pussy. Oh nah. It's a good start. Bono. I'm gonna come, I'm gonna come with you. Help Bono get There. I've been in the studio with, and they did some trash shit and we just nodded our heads. All of me webbing it like, Hey, you go.


Alright, thanks. Yo. Yo, You came through, you laced us. That's what it sounds like. Trash coming, coming out. The bigs. Yo. The bigs anyway. Parks. Can you play a little bit of the bono one? I don't want to, but I won't like just A second. Look what you want to hear. I, I wanna hear how bad It is that Parks really doesn't wanna play it. You might actually like it. She might cry. I do cry for everything these days. These are, I don't hate it. I I don't even like what they did to Bono's voice on here.


Like why say like, he doesn't, He doesn't sound bono. He Don't sound Bono e at all. They're like crank the tune up on Bono. They couldn't Afford Bono engineer, but I'm sure not. That's, That's No, this is some hip hop rap nigga touching bono vocals. I'm surprised. So if Bono heard it, he approved that Bono's like 60, 70 hour old. I'm about to saying, I'm saying Bono still hear things like we don't know nothing for this. No, He might have about on some Oh that sounds like some cool hip hop shit. Yeah, go ahead. You know what I mean? Like, You sound like Wayne said to bottom, yo do you write like, I think me and you could just pin this, pin this, it just is no writers Jazzie just said the rappers need songwriters, writers.


And I agree. I feel like they might have took Bono's vocal off of fucking him and Edge on the guitar and put that shit over a beat and was like, nah that works. Featuring Yeah. I don't think Bono was getting busy over this production, but I could be wrong. This don't sound like a beat. Bono's gonna be in the studio picking If I'm Wayne, I'm on the first thing to Canada. Y'all See that? Y'all sitting here being cute. You Wrongest I on. Hey. And that one if I'm Weezy f I'm headed to fucking Toronto.


Nigga. Next stop. Me and this boy look. Next stop. We gotta sit down, down Queens. Oh yeah, for sure mama. Oh, I'm pulling right up to Queens. Let's little mama. It is time again y'all. Yeah. Yeah. I can't be left to my own devices in the studio coming up with this. I'm, I'm starting group chat again. And I hate to tell you Aubrey, Nick, it would work. It would benefit every party that I'm saying involved. Yeah. Well that's where podcasts right now. That's where podcast theories can really get fun. Niggas gonna lit this sum up. I at least would like him to just say Amen. Just let's do one together. Yo joint. I'd rather him go Joint. Yeah. A whole joint.


Go go get Andre's fucking piano book bag and just walk around man. Nah, It is over dog. It is not. You know, It is not, It is old. I ate enough of this shit. Hot shit y'all been giving me. What I, what I take It is a wrap where I'm at with Wayne. We have to take the L today a little bit. No, no, no, I'm just saying I'm, he, He forecasted it. Where I'm at with Wayne is after this project is two things and one is, One is outside of just Wayne. It's a hip hop thing. But Carter VI Was ass did The fuck is going on. Carter four wasn't the greatest. I didn Carter four Was fire shit. I'm not doing that. And personally I like this better than Carter VI. But I'm cool with Wayne just giving me features at this point.


That part. So you agree with me? 'cause somebody else is doing Yeah. The work thinking to be. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what I mean when I say he should, should sit down for a second. I Ain't gonna do that neither. He sat down for a Second. Nah, I ain't gonna do that. 'cause I heard the level of rapping that he rapping at. Yeah. I just think that like y'all saying he need to go get with the team. I I I don't see how Drake is not a feature on this project. It might be something personal, but I don't see how Drake or Nick, Not theory, Drake Or Nick is not a feature On this project doing they not like us on the stage with you. When he did that shit act like he didn't know what it was about. You get what I'm saying? Yeah. That's the thing. You gotta go get Nick. If I'm Drake, Drake like, and I see the phone and It is Wayne.

Yeah, please give us some facts, Jimmy. Okay, so let's lay it out. Pause. October 3rd, 2024. Public breakup. They break up via Instagram, but said that they would remain quote best friends.


Oh, that's always a lie. A statement that didn't age incredibly well. They're going back and forth on social media, but then things heat up of course in March of 2025. DDG expresses that he's unable to see his son and that she's keeping Halo from him. Then Halle Bailey granted restraining order. This is May 13th, 2025. She obtained a temporary restraining order against DDG alleging physical, emotional, and financial abuse, including an incident where she talked about and showed pictures of a chipped tooth and physical harm on her arms. So that was said to be a dispute in the car over, you know, the, their, their son was in the car.


She showed pictures. She obtained a restraining order, May, 2025, custody and visitation. Bailey was granted temporary, physical and legal custody of Halo. She proposed su supervised weekly visits for DDG. I think it was like a few hours a week and requested restrictions on him taking Halo outside of LA County. Now at the same time, she's going to film a movie in Italy and she basically wants to take Halo for months at a time to Italy. So that's what she's proposing. She's gonna be in sole custody. Then DDG was silent about it. He was on Streamer University with Kai. We're not really sure how he feels. June 4th and fifth, 2025 DDG filed a restraining order against Bailey alleging that she actually posed a psychological risk to Halo.


He basically said she was unstable, she was unable to take care of a child. She talked about and then he provided text messages where it showcased her, you know, threatening her life, threatening suicide, threatening that her, her son wasn't gonna be around to see things. It was all kind of manic. And in those texts she also accused DDG of sleeping with someone in Mexico in Lala with Lala. Yes. Fellow streamer and definitely Hitting Lala the fuck she going in Mexico? Yeah. Straight off my streamer University hype. And we and you've been kind of, and you've been, you've been distant, You've been distant, You've been distant at worse. I mean, at best. Listen, gotta fuck Lala.


Anyway, so La Lala actually did she confirmed in her words, that didn't happen. It didn't happen. She held She down, she held it down And that's where we're at right now. They still fucking Oh yeah, you say that or wanna fuck again. Oh, they're gonna fuck again. Allegedly. Allegedly. We can't say that. But yeah. So that's where we're at right now. And he wants to prevent her from traveling out the country with Halo. Okay. The nature of the text messages that DDG released were very disturbing. They were, and there was a lot of talk around the cause of those texts being sent. Was this postpartum or was this a psycho girl?


Are there dates on the text? Did you find them? March of 2024. Okay. Now do we have enough facts to get into our feelings about this? I think that's a pretty good outline, right? Pretty good. It has a pretty good outline. Thank you Jeremy. Yeah, Thank you. Yeah. And feel free to stay for this in case you want to chime in on this tough topic. All Right? Okay. I'm here. All right. Flip, go to the kitchen on this tough topic. Yo, this topic right here. Flip. Go ahead. Get outta here, man. Don't worry about this Noah. It's flip gonna stand. Oh Man, I have no idea what anybody's take is regarding this, so I'd love to hear it.


I know Mel, Mel, you, I feel like the only reason why we know any of this is because he is constantly online talking about it and it after the breakup being completely disparaging of her making his claims, et cetera, et cetera. Also, when he went on, when he started talking about the fact that she was, you know, preventing him from seeing Halo, he did this on his streaming platform with his millions of viewers creating like a hashtag free halo. What does that do? That encourages your audience to go to her and start bullying her without any of the facts other than the ones that you just presented, which are up for fucking debate.


Who, you know what, whoever's right, whoever's wrong. It really is. It's gotten so fucking messy. Nobody even knows. But my stance is he has been, he see, he comes off as being so fucking wildly stressful to deal with after you've just had a baby. I, I'm just, I'm going to, I'm, I'm standing 10 toes down on Halley's side. I don't even have to have all the facts. The fact of the matter is she had a baby she has That's on brand. No. Shocker. Yeah. Plot twist with this. It's because, because that's just how I think. Oh, you're wrong by the way. Yeah. I just, I I think, Well, somebody reasoning maybe it all seems like messy Shit to me.


It is very messy shit. But at the end of the day, you have a young girl who's trying to manage a career, manage a relationship, have a baby, and then, you know, there's debates on how long postpartum actually lasts, but it ain't six to fucking eight weeks. It's a really long time for women to start feeling any semblance of fucking normalcy. And she's in the public eye. She has a baby daddy who's going to the fucking world to get his, to get a sense of validation or to get them to agree with him like that is wildly stressful. So maybe she did have a manic, you know, episode where she's saying a bunch of fucked up things in texts. Why is she being judged on her worst moments when she is in a, in the most vulnerable fucking state?


And that is why I'm going to be on her side. And also he wants to, he wants to file a restraining order child. She filed one first and was granted she don't wanna be around you. This is, hold on. This is the same motherfucker that went to her house, keeps going to her house, unannounced, breaks into her house, takes a picture of her bed to let her know that he's inside your house and can get in your house whenever you want. And then rips out. The camera systems. Did, did how fucking safe does this girl feel? There's Allegedly. Allegedly. Okay. Allegedly One thing, his, his order was what he filed was so that she can't take the baby to Italy. Okay. For that time. Like not trying to be around her or keep her away from him.


It's just, I don't want you to take my son. That's what he was filing. There's a lot of situations, Mel, when you don't take the text message serious that something end up happening to the child. We've seen that a lot of times. Whether it's a, when, when it comes to domestic issues, they say all the signs were right there. Like the signs were right there. So him filing this restraining order based off of the text message that she's been sending him is a right move for him to do. I'd like to challenge a few of the things that you said. Okay, good. Who? Male? Yeah. In terms of weaponizing a fan base to bully you. They're both doing that. They both are doing that. Eh, I don't see how she's done it.


She Now we let you get a runway to get all of your shit off. Let's have the conversation without us triggering one another. 'cause I'm not trying to trigger nobody and please don't trigger me. And this topic could be triggering. It is very trigger. I, I don I done, I done done been through every aspect of this. The second that she left him fan bases were weaponized because you had the Disney girl, the Beyonce girl, the clean sister act girl fan base saying your dog, you lucked up. She should have never been with you. You was a bum. You clout chasing every chance you get.


You mentioning a baby, you mentioning her, she don't want you. That was a thing. That was a real thing. I'm saying this, that somebody Fam it went on up here. We got into an argument about DDG. Yeah, I don't remember. He's he's right. We did, we we got into an argument about DDG. You took Chloe's side. I mean you took Hailey's side. We took DDG side. We got into an argument about DDG. So it's not like he was the person that was throwing out the, the bully shit. And she was just on the receiving end of that. Yeah, I that's not true. They, both of their fan bases were weaponized. She, She did not weaponize hers. She couldn't for, for just, just let me say this one thing. Just one thing and then y'all got it. You gonna hijack the topic? No. Holy shit. You're gonna hijack Jack.


Go ahead. Hi Jack. Dog piled on me. I just want one Wanna say this one thing? Go Ahead. She did not weaponize her fan base. And furthermore, everybody's saying that he's a clown. Stay away from her, from him, blah, blah. She didn't listen. She followed her own heart. She, that was the man she wanted. She chose, she had a baby with him. He, she did not listen to anybody. So she did not weaponize her fan base. They made their own assumptions. Mel can he went on streaming to now Mel, now now you off attention. Can you not respond to each point that we're about to make? Okay. The same way we did with you. That's all I'm asking. Right. I have more of your points That I'd like to challenge. She don't even, even with that weaponization point, the artists sometimes don't have to say skip, Go do it.


Yeah. They don't have to Do that. If nothing else. We've proven that both of them played part in Yeah. The weaponization of fan bases. One, two. In terms of things being made public and why they are made public, they're playing court courthouse games. True. Indeed. Courthouse games is not only where things become public, but it's where both parties go to say the worst of the worst about the other. So unfortunately these stories, the break breaking stories, they're public because they're court filings. Three, she laid her hand in some of this being public when she vehemently was against the kid going to Conant's house And put that out And she put it out.


So all I'm saying is at the start, you have two young people that are engaging in the messiness of a breakup after a baby. That's That's fair. Yeah. Like my thing and I, I'm not on anybody's side. Again, I think the child is the, the real recipient of of all this bullshit. Of the negativity. Yeah. But how, I don't understand to Joe's point, how you could say, yo, I don't want my kid around s and i or on the stream or anything of that sort. But you are electing to take my kid across to a whole different country outside of me. I Thought that's totally, I thought you was about I think that's very, very different.


I think that's different personally. A lot of shit goes on at on these streams. It'd be, it'd be girls. It'd be, it'd be a lot of shit going on on the streams. Me take her, taking the kid with, with her to work in another, just, just happens to be in another country. You no, you can have a nanny. You got whatever over there with you. I'm not subjecting the kid to anything necessarily. Supposedly. You don't know. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. That supposedly, supposedly. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This, you can't do that without my consent. No bigger than that. I Don't give a fuck. If you got a nanny and you got the best condition, you cannot do that without my consent. We know that It is Dad's what I don't like to do is this depending on how But isn't that what the retraining Order set up order says that that's not necessarily, depending on what set up the Restraining order basically says she has sole custody.


Yeah. If she got Sold. So she wants to make that decision. She can do that. That I don. That's not true. That is incorrect. I don't know that to be true with y'all. That Is incorrect. You are wrong. Does she have So I don't know what they got. You cannot do whatever you want just because you have sole custody's incorrect. You can't do that. I've been through it. I know that y'all want to fucking, It is the eraser of father rights around here, you know, but you cannot take this baby. No, you can't. It's not true. And my thing is this, and I hate that this point gets overlooked, fam, you had enough discernment to lay down and have a baby with this man, right? Yes. We are electing this man to be the father of your child. Can I pause You right there for a second and, and add to what you're saying may be messy, but It is being spoken about.


He convinced her to have the baby. She said I'm having an abortion. No, that's part of man, listen, there's another side to this that paints her as being emotionally manipulative. And I think that is what he filed in his court filings. But, and I'm not even going to continue to speak to that. I can speak to how a dad moved when he want the kid. Yes, That's True. That's what I can speak facts. Is there, is there proof of her making that statement? No. It's not proof of some of, there's not lot of shit. You alleged neither. But we, we talk about this. We're legend. Well, I think that that go We'll talk to our fact checker Jeremy. Yeah. Well Fa what I'm saying is A different point. Please fact check that if there's any proof, written proof that she said she was going to have an abortion and he convinced her to have the baby, because if not, then that is just his word against hers.


And that is, that's nasty. You know what there is written proof of We can't do that though. We can't do that. It is written proof. Can't say it's written proof of this, but we don't have written proof of that. And the things that we don't have written proof Of. No, I'm just talking about text messages since you wanted to them out. No, but Didn't up didn't bring up written proof of when he broke in the house and yada. Don't have proof. We don't have proof of these things. Those things either. He Took a picture of her bed So He Could have took that picture nine years ago. He let her know that I'm in your house. I could take a picture of your, I'm taking a picture of your Bed. You're getting that from a police report, Mel, is what we saying. But anyway, So what I Saying, let us know when you have facts. It doesn't seem like there's any public record of her saying that. DDG said in an interview, we weren't aiming for a baby, it kind of happened.


What are we gonna do? He said she always wanted to be a mom and I always wanted a kid. So from there, we just made a decision to go through it. I don't know if there's any public record of her saying that. Bro, this gotta impress the point I was making something different. The point I was making is, yo, the second that we elect to have a child, right? Let's just say for all intents and purposes it was agreed upon mutually. I'm sure it was. You now can't, when we break up, say, yo, that bitch is a bum mom, I ain't never want to have a baby with her. I don't want her to be alone with my kid. You elected to have a child with this woman. So that speaks to your judgment and your own discernment that you thought in that moment she would've been a decent mom and vice versa.


So if you had somebody, can't me wrong though. Yeah. I'm not disagreeing with you. But in the moment, you can have the confidence that this man is gonna be a good dad. So you are thinking that he's gonna have your child's best interest at heart when he has your child. And vice versa on the woman's side. Young people don't think that like that Don no, young people don't give it that much thought. That's too, that's too many words or too many thoughts. No, you are in the moment. I agree. I like each other. You can both want to have a baby. You can decide to wanna have a baby, but they're not thinking about, oh, I think he'll be the best father, or I think she'll be the best mother. Nobody, and they don't know what having a baby means. Like they don't know all the shit that changed. Like the person that you with right now ain't gonna be the same person after that baby. I think wh neither one you will be like, yo dog, she had my baby over here. I don't want my baby over there.


Depending on if it's a harmful situation or not, of course, but y don't want my baby around these people, my nigga. That's not your choice to make. And then vice versa on the woman's side, yo, I don't want my baby around her sister. Or if they not putting your kid in harm's way, my nigga, that's not your choice to make. That is fact. You laid down and had a baby with this woman and you have to trust that the man and the woman are gonna do appropriate things with your child in mind. The only thing I I I'm familiar with when it comes to consent from both parents is when you trying to take a child to get a passport outta the country. Yeah. If the man name is on the birth certificate, you cannot go and take the child to get a passport without the man. You can't take the child out the country either. The child has to sign to take, I mean, pardon me.


The parent has to sign for you to take them out the country. Mm. And and not to interrupt, but just to, to clarify in the court filing that DDG made. It's, it does say so, petition or threaten me by demanding that we reconcile or she would go through with the abortion. This was the most troubling of her attempts to coercively control me. So she DDG is claiming that, that she did That. But again, again, it's a claim. That's a claim. It's A claim. It's a claim. It's a claim though. These text messages that he released, the disturbing ones, if you believe that these are texts and not doctored and really happened, and they say a lot, I mean, they do tell a story. They do, do y'all want, should I read 'em?


Sure. You can go The trust. This is a blurry version. I'll try my best. The trust issues are becoming overwhelming. Maybe that's for the best. I put in too much time and effort into making you happy to have to deal with the bullshit every day. And in your eyes, you're never wrong. It's frustrating and I'm over it. I'm no longer entertaining this argument. I need to work on becoming more successful, like quote unquote Jay-Z like you said. Then maybe you'll take my vision of becoming a big label owner serious, instead of shitting on my dreams every second you get Yeah, she says, you don't want to be with me. That's okay. I will never beg anyone.


I will be successful. I don't need to be with someone who was going to demean me. You like that? I'm insecure. It makes you feel good about yourself. I'm not doing this anymore. Keep your phone on airplane mode. But when I die, don't say shit. See, It is a lot. TMI. This is, this is, It is, this is two young people And seeing, being super manipulative to each other because they're fucking feelings are involved and shit like that. Like they're, they're just, they're really, they're just be, they're fucking nasty to each other. But who in this room doesn't know what that experience is like? Right. When it gets, when you're, when you're at that point where you're mad at each other or where you think that the break is happening and one person is playing super fucking nonchalant, usually the guy and the girl is like, you know, just spazzing out and shit like that.


That's all I hear from those text messages. Oh, it Sounds like both of 'em are doing both things. Yeah. Sounds like both of 'em are playing nonchalant of 'em are child. I don hear Both of 'em not playing nonchalant Parks. Mel, enough of y'all too now, but not enough, but enough of you two. I don't hear her playing nonchalant at all. This is what I'm saying. Not enough of you. What I'm saying is this, and again, speaking from a little bit of experience, I don't know if you brothers have any experience here, and if y'all do, I don't know why y'all talking it right now. No, I wanna hear your point because we about to make it, this, this is what I'm saying in the beef, where two people are wrong in playing the part. Yeah. There's the person that's playing along in whatever the beef is, and then there's somebody that's not playing at all.


There's somebody that is so angry or so emotional and so narrow minded that they are not looking at The Bigger Picture here. Once she says to him, I will die behind this, or whatever the fuck she said, even if it's from whatever it's from as a parent. Yeah. Now we, you have taken this to another level, and I don't know if you are of enough health and mind, body and spirit to take care of you and a child, and nobody talks about that part of postpartum. I'm not against y'all calling this behavior postpartum. Y'all got all types of words. Postpartum, Stockholm, lemme Ask, but postpartum, but postpartum is, that's, there's nothing to deny about postpartum.


Postpartum is what happens after you have a baby. It is, there's postpartum depression. There's s like there is postpartum and there is like her, her hormone, like it's stressful enough to have, have had a child. But when you enter into a, a, a chaotic, erratic, you know, situation with the person that is supposed to be loving on you and the kid and creating stress, can You care for a child with postpartum, Mel, I don't need the word too. You Re you can care for a child, but you gotta do everything that you possibly can to create a, as as stress free environment as possible. And it doesn't seem like this is what's happening In caring for the child. Should you text anybody and say, I'm gonna kill myself.


And if you do, how do you think that person should react? Respond, react. That, that's my question. Yes. That's in seeing that tweet if I ever got that tweet, You've never had a girl say that to you and A kid we're talking about? No, no, no. I'm asking, I'm talking, I'm, I'm I'm talking about with a child. Yeah. Someone that I have a child with, like my baby mother has never gotten to that had she did my immediate number one thing is I gotta go get my kid. Okay. If, Whether you serious or not, I can't play with it. I, And I under and I totally understand that. But ice, if, if we're gonna be talking about you, to me, I don't know what happened between you and your baby mama if it was contentious or whatever, but you seem to be an extraordinarily even keeled, logical person, you know?


So I don't really, I don't know, but I don't really see you antagonizing No, your baby mama. Especially after the kid has been born. I just don't See that happening with you. That is what I see. I am, I I don't, I don't matter in this situation, but this I get It is I get, this is how I am reading the situation. He is incredibly antagonizing to a woman who has just had his child and they're playing these nasty little fucking games with each other. But to me, she doesn't really want to play these games. He releases the text messages just to get everybody on. He's, he's playing that game of trying to get the, It's not to get everybody on side, but trying to get, doing, trying to get the public I'm doing because I'm trying to get the courts to understand what I'm dealing with.


When were these, okay, you freeze. Let me Ask you a question. When were the text messages written versus when were they released? Because if there's a huge gap, gap between He dropped the, the text messages, the, the, from what I, the dates I looked at was March 2nd, 2024. March, 2024. Yeah. And Then, well, the text messages came out a couple days ago when he filed to keep her from leaving in Defense. After she Released Yes. After she, yes. Can I ask you a question? Does anybody know how old their child is? He's, he, he's one at the most. Yeah. Cool. Almost two. So I almost two. I want stay here. One and a half. I don't wanna fight you. I'm putting it out on the record that I don't wanna Fight. You're agree with the facts, Jeremy? Yeah. Thanks Jeremy. So, so think about this. Postpartum can last for a certain amount of time, right?


So you are clear in saying that postpartum is a real thing where you may or may not be in control of your hormones, your emotional state, your mental state, et cetera. Yes. In certain instances, yes. You think it iss a Lineup? I I know I I'm not So we're not gonna give an answer. So to everybody in the room, we've heard that Postpartum means yes. Yes. You, you, you don't have control. Thank, Thank you. Because nobody has control over their hormones. You don't, you can't control them. I'm asking. You're Right Mel, I'm asking you a question. Simple. You're right. She can't control Hormones. So if you are already dead and postpartum can last for the better part of a year, postpartum can last they said multiple years. Yes. So if this person is saying that I'm thinking about killing myself, IE my child, whatever the case may be, then I don't give a fuck when the text messages came out.


If you're saying that the child is less than a year old or a year old, those text messages are still valid. 'cause she could still be under emotional, hormonal and mental distress. Right? Now see, my only, my only my only issue with that and I'm, I'm, I'm inserting myself here, Paul. If I were to get that message, I'm not waiting. Thank you. From March to not disagreeing. Thank you. A year or so later. That's not my point. My point is, those messages still remain valid today if her emotional and mental state are still compromised today. So is she. Yeah, but if you really felt that way, why are you waiting a year? I act on that. So hold on. I Don know that he Did we moving, that I'm talking about today. It is, You know, if I'm him and she wrote me that text message, you know what I'm doing right In that moment, I am calling whatever authority that I need to, and I am try, I'm going to try my hardest to get, I don Dunno if he did To get a psychological, To get a Psychological.


Mel, Mel, Mel, this is where I have to interrupt you. Okay, go ahead. I have to interrupt you with, with respect. You can't say that you don't, you have no idea what you would do. When this topic came up with me and my girl and, and we were talking about the text, I said, I mean I wasn't all the way serious. If I See that text I'm calling the police. I said that same thing that you just said. Yeah. She reminded me. I had already been, I had been through that text. Yeah. And, and didn didn't call the cops call didn't Call the police at all. I know I went outside while we were on her birthday dinner and did my best to talk to, You know what I mean? Like, you know, you can't just say I'm going to call the police all the radical shit and can't gauge the radical, the seriousness of somebody when they texted us all of, And that's, they weren't even broken up yet.


And that, and that's, and that's my point. And of course, you know, we are totally armchair quarterbacking this situation. We're just opining on their fucking business because it's everywhere. But to your point, you're right. You don't know what you're gonna do in this situation. You can think in hindsight and say, I would be comfortable having a psychological evaluation done on her because I'm concerned for my child. You would think that that's what somebody would think. But if they don't in the moment, then that's understandable too. It's also understandable to think that she's just being hysterical in the moment saying something to try to get a rise out of you. Okay. Because nothing else has Worse. But lemme me, but let me tell you for all of This, this is, but hold up, but potentially True also as a man, there are a lot of steps and hurdles that you have to get to before you convince a judge or a court that a psych ev v is needed for your child's mother.


It is not just as simple as you going in there and requesting one. I feel, I feel like, Because niggas go in court all the time and say, Hey this lady, But you know what? They don't they gonna use it. But you, you know what they don't, they don't have a whole list of text messages showing potentially like Erratic behavior. Yeah, Yeah. You just going in off word of mouth and man thoughts. Yes. You gotta prove a lot of that. I feel like wrong. You're wrong about that. I feel like it's dangerous. Wrong. That's not true to when you're talking about postpartum. It is dangerous to point the blame at the other person instead of finding solutions of how to deal with postpartum when Mel is telling the story or freeze even you, you're saying that the environment has to be like this and be like that.


But It is really limited to no solution in dealing with somebody with postpartum. And I feel like it's very reckless to just, you know, put the blame on the person that's in that position as far as like creating an environment, a safe environment. You mean a man or the woman putting it on, on the man. Okay. Because there's no solution. What Mel is saying or what Mel said is, yo a, I see him antagonizing somebody who's dealing with postpartum. Maybe he doesn't know how to deal with a person who's going through postpartum now watch this man online, say how much you're please leave her alone. We are not going there. I'm not talking about her. I still love her, this and that. And the third, I try to keep my distance, whatever she says. 'cause I don't know what she's dealing with at this current moment.


Especially young people. They don't know how to deal with that and their kids. So to say that and like, oh, he's creating an environment like that. What about the person with postpartum creating their environment as well? How do we deal with that? How does the person dealing with the person that's going through postpartum navigate in that system? Hey, lemme tell you, I'm I'm, I'm gonna use myself. There was a time when I thought my baby mother was suffering from postpartum depression. Yeah. I spoke about this back when we was in. We did. We did. And and I went to her and said that, Hey, I know I'm not equipped to deal with this. I don't even know fully what It is. Do you think we could talk to somebody? I'll pay for it. Whatever the case, let's find somebody. Let's try. That's amazing because I I ain't the right person.


I know that whatever I could say is probably gonna be wrong might make it worse. But I see there is something happening here. She told me no she wasn't. And we let it, we it, it continued to get worse to the point. That's when she wasn't what? Hell wasn't, somebody Wasn't interested. I was just, while you was talking I thought you would end differently. But I'm like, damn, that's the blessing. I went through that and the person I was speaking to had no idea that that was postpartum. It was her first kid. She didn't know. Yeah. I'm coming to you saying nobody Knows. Hey, is this that? 'cause they warned us about it in the hospital. Yep. Is there a way to help? And if you say no, now we just back to dealing with whatever comes with Exactly. Or if you are a man and you and they say no, you sitting there like, oh, oh, Alright.


Right. Can I, can I suggest Having children and then the side don't have post sports Late thirties that niggas having that nigga's having children. Y'all Having children in y late thirties show how to deal more knowledgeable than somebody in their early twenties. Much more tolerant, much more patient. Can You Right. Can I also suggest something that because she said no and because yours said no, there is a lot of women, women when they become mothers, even before they become mothers, when they're pregnant, there is this, there's this pressure to become super mom and know everything immediately. And I'm speaking from the standpoint of I've never had a child. I lost one. So I never had one. But I have a lot of friends that I was there for when their children were born.


And I was a really, I was very supportive because they just didn't know what they were doing. You know, they're not, you're, they feel like they're expected to know everything, but you don't know anything. You don't know what you don't know until you fucking know it. And a lot of times that added pressure and a lack of understanding that you are physically in postpartum. Not not knowing because you've never had it before. You've never experienced it. You just know you feel whatever you feel it. It's, I feel like it's difficult to identify that that's what you're going through in the moment that you're going through if you've never experienced it before. No, and that's, that's all I'm gonna say in this scenario. That is an amazing point. I agree with her. For women and men And men, You don't know.


And that's what you don't know. That's exactly what I was about to say. I'm not mute It up. Just mute it up. I was gonna, I was gonna agree with you But let me finish. Go, go my plane. Sorry. Like so you don't I agree. You don't know what you don't know until you know it. And guess what, in the household with the postpartum woman and the man, no, he going be second to know it. No time out though. 'cause Mel said yo, the women think that they supposed to be supermom might not be. Niggas think they supposed to be super dad too. That is a fact. You've just taken on a whole new individual that is responsible for breathing because of you. That is a fact. You gotta make sure that they're healthy. You gotta make sure that they're fed. You gotta make sure just clothed, you gotta also provide a di. Kids ain't cheap.


So now you bring on whole new experiences, whole new expenses. Like it's a different ball game. It's just not a ball game. And I please don't take this, it ain't just a ball game that women are playing. The men are entered into that game as well and that piece gets pushed to the side. It is to to, to add on my nigga. When my daughter woke up, I took the night shift. I'm self-employed when my girl works, my nigga, when my daughter woke up at nighttime at three and two and whatever, I'm the nigga that sat in the rocking chair rocking my daughter back to sleep. Men get just pushed to the side for that shit nigga. I'm the nigga that's going downstairs doing all the other shit when my girl is asleep. What you called the Mexicans and told 'em though about the business? Nothing nigga you gotta, yo no he's right my nigga.


That modifies your business that all of that shit took place. Like yo people just look at it like it's a one-sided thing. It's not. And look to what you were saying as a man, you ain't just looking at, you gotta make sure the baby's good. You making sure, you gotta make sure she good too. Nigga. My girl could barely walk. She had a C-section. My girl could barely walk. I had to walk her, pick her up off the toilet, walk her to the bed from the fucking toilet my nigga. All of those things, making sure I'm me. I sleep hard kind of. Y'all gotta wake up on a schedule to make sure my girl is taking her antibiotics and her pain pills, all of that shit on different schedules and all of that stuff. It's a joint effort fam. I hate when we sit up here and act like it's just a woman thing. It's not just a woman thing. Even though they're going through mad shit that we couldn't possibly fathom.


Men are going through other shit and we just discredit that piece. So to that to, to them. I hate that this is Discre is public. We discre it because they push somebody out of this shit. Of Course, of course. No Nigga understand why we it's we're not saying it's, They even not even remotely. It is not even, no, it's not even remotely equal. I'm just saying that both of these people are ignorant and not knowledgeable about what is going on and what's to come. I want to add on to what y'all saying too. Not saying this applies here, but them chicks with the angel images. I know, I know. Ain't nobody gonna talk about it. There you go. I know. Ain't nobody gonna talk about it. You right. We ain't gonna talk about it. I'm gonna talk about it though.


Have at it Joe Yo featuring ice Ish and flipping mail and park. You talking Dr. Mark, Jeremy Hecht. You know I'm saying the, the women with the angel images are able to get off A lot Under the guise of, I have an angel image and I imagine it to be frustrating for a man. I'm not even just talking about them. They young. So we gonna apply to Young card, but there are a lot of people out there hiding behind just this, this, this image of perfection and behind the scenes they are an absolute demon and fucking monster.


And nobody believes the guy because this girl done been in a fucking movie or two. And I could say that a million times. I thought it about Kiki Palmer and her baby daddy with what they went through. I could name you six different couples to where the lady is an angel. So nah, no way she did that. Yep. Kick fucking rocks Man. Nigga. Do you know what Johnny Depp went do? I didn't look at that case, but yeah, Similar shit. Like until he started oh, Amber Bird, he had to prove that he started, he had to prove like, yo no dog, she shitted in my bed. I wasn't familiar with Amber Bird. They Didn't believe nobody was, but she had an image of a certain level of innocence or purity or coolness that he had to now start going to get voicemails and recordings that she didn't know when he was recording her saying, you pussy, I only smacked you, you pussy, you a man, eat it, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.


Like he had to have video. I mean not video, audio recordings of the shit that was transpiring before he was even taken seriously. Yeah. I just think that, I just think it's whack. I think that shit is whack. That that's it. I don't, I don't have a deeper dive on it, but it's a lot of it going on out there. I'll be without class and co to continue to give you the names on this list so I won't. But anyway, I just wish it wasn't all public. Like that's the worst. That's The horrible that that's the yeah, that's The horrible part. We're seeing every inch of this play out in public and it was clearly a lot of like, there was maybe postpartum depression, manic, there was maybe cheat, like there's all these things going on, but we had to see all of that play out versus them just working it out in private.


Which again, I'm, I'm not in the public eye like that. I don't have a child, so I can't speak to that, but man, I'm throwing some of that on the way. It'd be the women rushing to the courthouse. It'd be the women rushing to the courthouse to get help because the nigga, the dude is not doing something that they want or not behaving accordingly. Men, I'll speak for black men. A lot of them ain't rushing to go start the courthouse process. S that that ain't happening some more shit that's taboo that we can't say You right. It be they ass going up there. Shit. In my case I said it, yo, this is about to go public. You, you, we should, let's do our best. It never works like that. So I mean we can sit there and, and I feel like Colin, Ben Staples, oh it's public.


It's public. You where did the fuck did You think it was going? But that's a, you ain't important enough for them to seal nothing. You didn't pay for no fucking mediator. You went to court. And unfortunately the emotional part and the young part, they don't even think that far. They don't think about It. Is age coming to that Part? I know, but I'm supposed to think the person that all right, we can do age. Age plays a part. The person, the per I'm. So I'm just saying I'm, I received that. The person that don't think that far is also the best person to look after a child Boy got good. That ain't no Crisco. There s That ain't this topic hits home for that's lard Home. The topic hits home for It does.


It does. Boy L Yeah. Fat back in that motherfucker. I ain't even going to Popeye's. I'm over here. I'm busy. I'm glad I I survived. I survived. Fuck you. And a lot of that is en large credit to, to both of my kids' moms. It may have been rough for a second. I survived and I couldn't have done it without you. That's, I feel I couldn't have done it without you. I'm I'm, I'm in the same boat. I'm extremely grateful and blessed. Hey, the other night my kid left the house, they threw line out There and he Got the Swiffer. My kid left the house the other day I didn't and I couldn't find the apple remote. I'm so flying my co-parenting. I called late like a mutt.


Yeah. Hey, if the kid is awake After where I'm remote at, Me and mine don't talk afternoon. 11 o'clock, 10 o'clock. Nah, I wouldn't even do that because you know you don't want motherfucker start thinking shit. Call. Hey, whatever you do, you make a popcorn with your nigga. I don't know what you're doing over there. I want it to be peaceful though. She's Thinking it's an emergency. Like, Oh yeah, something must be really wrong here. He's calling after. Well and It is an emergency. I don need that, that Remote for something. You gotta get the app on your phone for, you know what I Mean? I should do the it It is already on your phone. Comes just control it from your phone. She put him on the phone, he was stressed. I don know Eric doing man.


You see I put him Back. Yo, you got it bitch. I love you man. I love you man. But shit, that shit like, that's just a blessing for me. It's the little things. It's the little things I done been through the depths of this and it don't feel good. So prayers to both of them. Indeed I shall, I shall mine. Prayer of I hope y'all find a pathway. And The baby And the baby, nobody wanna say it. The baby come after we the common Ground after common Ground, we settle off fight Common Ground. We'll both get to think about the baby again in a second, but Sure. Wild. Let Once, once the, once the Emotions cool off. Yeah. Yeah. That's it. Once some Emotions cool off, then you can start thinking about the baby if they ever do. Yeah, I, I agree.


What'd you throw on after you got the remote? That's the real question. Oh damn. What was I feeling in the finish? Oh, the friends and the John Hammond One. I had to finish something. It wasn't that I'll remember it. I'll remember him coming back to me. I was in the middle of some shit I had to finish. Oh, it was on, on Netflix. What's the shit I've been watching on fucking Netflix, the three episodes Love Island. No, why don't I just open Netflix? It wasn't Mob Land. Yo, It is Mob Land. But You'all came Out this weekend. No, it wasn't, it wasn't Mob Land. It was the three episodes. But anyway, I'll let Jeremy No, but what is our, what is our next topic?


You, you guys did great. You too. You did great. Nah, so you killed that shit. I was worried. I heard you did good though. You could hear that tick that that's earlier. That's why I was like, everybody just stopped because I, I thought we could, we could hear the ticking mail. I thought she was getting ready. It was about to be a storm off. It'd be jumping out. Oh no, Not doing that anymore. You okay? I am. Okay. You got all POVs there. I feel like. Yeah. I can't wait to hear you and DJ Head and Elliot Wilson. Break this down. You know what? I think we might be skipping that one on the topic. That's my problem up here. Like, we don't know. We don't skip shit and when we skip shit, we get in trouble. I respect it because, but the internet gets on you guys if you do skip it like they will your Community we're scared to Talk about it, get so strong.


They'll be like, oh. And they have conspiracies about it too. Yep. They be like, oh, they didn't talk about it. They're scared to talk about that. Or they, some such and such is paying them. Oh. Do you guys look at all that stuff? Like, I know you have the JBP community and Twitter, like are you looking at all these clips and all the stuff that people are saying every week? Like do you guys pay attention? They See a lot it them too. I used to, I stopped. No, I don't see a lot. Yeah, I see it all. I see every word that said, I search every name. I go on every platform. I look at the niggas with two views, 10 views, a hundred views, a thousand views. Every one of them niggas talking shit or picking us up. I'm looking Because because I see, I feel like you give nods to it too. Like you'll, you'll throw little like comments in that, you know, the people who commented it will see it and they'll be like, oh see we're making our, you know, we're Having an impact.


Is it true? Look at you. You one Of You picking it up. You think it up. What else needs our our attention? Huh? Come on, We on a roll. We on a roll. You guys don't stop now. All right. Well we, we, I mean it's it's not in the same realm still beef, but It is court involved. Eminem is suing Meta for, Oh I'm not familiar with this. Yeah. Yes. He's suing Meta for hundred million. A hundred. Yeah. A hundred million dollars. They've licensed. Well they've, they've used his music without licensing. How so? Through Instagram, Facebook, all platforms. All their platforms.


He's suing them for 109 million and it's over 200 songs that they have been allowed on their platforms without Interesting. Like Any license. So use on like reels and shit like that. Yeah, All of that For years. It's been for years almost I think a decade or or a little around there that they, they've allowed their users to bump his shit and they said he just sat back in the cut Chilling until accumulated to the point where he could sold for $109 million. So couldn't every artist in theory that do the same thing's What what say? Yeah, but that we, they might've already got those artists license or they might've got, I don't know how the license and shit works, but when I was reading over it Yeah, it was saying that basically they've been allowed people to use his shit for a decade.


Apparently he got control without Yeah, without pain. Got it. That they don't have got it. That the other artists don't have. Yes. Or he might own his shit. I don't know how it's working. I think, I don't know his situation. You get What I'm saying though? If he, if he, if he owns his own shit, then they would've had to come directly to him. Whereas other artists, they might have to go to UMG or somebody else that owns they shit. Right. Interesting. Yeah. Or they might got a partnership met, might already got a partnership with UMG. Yeah, they do for the whole gamut of their artists. Yeah. Whereas if he owns his own shit, they might be outside of that scope Or he might be just trying to start something. You know what I mean? Like break down a a barrier could be, which I mean kudos to him if he Does a hundred mil, a hundred million.


Yeah. Do you think that that affects things at this point where Instagram's just gonna say fuck it, we're removing all music? No. No. 'cause they got deals in place already. Most artists don on their own music. They, they're actually, if you go down, go post something on Instagram now, have you add music, we will make you make you increase your reach. They'll kill 10 of y'all artists before they remove your music. What the fuck are y'all talking about? A magic. A magic bow accident. Yeah, the Sharks got 'em. We Fire Alist artists. Your music, Those artists want their music on there. Yeah. And he probably does too to a degree. But I wanna get paid compensated. I'm curious to read more about this. I was, I was unaware Dancing you from earlier Jeremy.


It was the Tylenol murderers I had to finish. I was on episode three. Ah, Tylenol murderers. Ty Turning cyanide into the capsules. Oh you Did? I wish anybody up here would would watch it because it like kind of ended on a cliffhanger her and I don't know. I watch it. I would totally watch it. Definitely.

I like them all. I never Started. I like Them all As as shit Yellowstone. I like all Yellowstone. The main one is super, Super Nice. Yeah. I just don't know if It is good enough for me and my girl.


It is. That's important. It fucking is. If It's good enough for her then I'll watch it sooner. My Girl put be on Yellowstone. I mean in my track The shows that only Joe Butter likes my girl will be on Yellowstone are gonna take a while now I can't just immediately watch. I Have to find time for those. You gotta find time for the solo shows. You're like hiding in the corner. Watching what? Yo, y'all missing what he's saying. I'm not hearing him. He don't have the time for the solo show. He can't Watch. There's plenty of shows that Joseph Anthony Button Jr. Would love would be into and love to start like Yellowstone being one of them. But I have to wait till I'm 30. I mean 56, 77. So those don't get take present. Do you Have a list? You just have a list of one day to this? Yes. Yeah I do too. Yeah. Yeah. I And you Better finished Mob Land as soon as my girl got away from me Ran right through it.


Yeah. Now I don't wanna put that on her. I'm not a big fan of the accents and she knows that so we just left it. But when she left I was like I'll try these British motherfuckers and I can't lie some of the worst English accents you'll ever hear in a series. Which is funny 'cause I think Pierce Brosnan is really from over there. Yeah. And his accent was too bad. I don't know why like Those accents were really bad for me. Bad is some of that other Shit nigga. I had to get through that and not understand a third of what they was talking about. Sometimes Y'all know I hate but my hearing is bad too though. But that all that turn that shit up into Bigs for 30 years. Yeah, It don't work. It don't work. I put my TV to volume 89.


I can't hear nothing they with the subtitles on anyway. I didn't love Moblin in they, I didn't Love it. I didn't love the, it was Too great of a series. I didn't love the ending. But you know, You see they're going in season two. You With absolute certainty they going in season two. So Yeah but gimme something. Gimme something. I know you going in season two, you had a good series. Nah, I think they left it open Too open for me. I think too open. I think they got four or five directions. I think it's going to get better. Why you didn't show me what Pierce Brosnan's wife was doing the same way you showed me Pierce in the jail scene at the end. They did. I think we should have got a a another one. Another one. They Did you do you know how many of these actors are actually English in Mob Land?


No. Like Helen Marin. Helen Marin. She's an English actress. Tom Hardy. Tom Hardy's English Pierce Brosnan is Irish actually That's why I didn don't understand nothing Tom Hardy was Saying. No. And, and Pierce Brosnan puts on an Irish accent. You said he got a bad English accent. Whatever his Accent is. Irish. Irish. He was the worst. He was saying he from, he's From Ireland. I Don't care. It was, he was from Ireland in the Show. I don care authentic. Janet makes tears. Yes, she's an English actress. There's these were real accents. Yeah. That's not changing what I'm saying. Okay. All right. We Still don't like this shit. They real English accents. It is trash are bad. So you know there's different English accents too.


Right. That's true Too. Educate me. I don't, Okay, so there there's refined English accents like Downton Abbey and then there is like cockney accent Accent's. The shit mans in them. What's in it? It is the bad part. When we think about England, we only think about London. Yeah. Y don't like that. It's like how somebody thinks about New York City in a tribute to the United States. Yeah. Motherfuckers from North, North Carolina don't speak like us. Motherfuckers from Cleveland don't speak like us. People from LA don't speak like us. So we just attribute England to London and think that everybody from England is supposed to talk palace. And it's like no, there's like the e the south side, like they are, it's A bunch of shit. Manchester, different shit Dodgy in England.


You know What else didn't make sense in mob land? Let me, let me fucking just ruin people. Mob. Yeah, go ahead. Spoiler alert. So fast forward me, what is the real nature between Pierce's wife and Steven homie that she called Stevenson? It don't make sense. I think He popped. He did. But that, it don't make sense. It don't make sense. I think he popped. I think she had, she thought her cache with him was bigger than it was. You just, alright stop Ish. This is where you lose me again. Fast forward you this 'cause I'm ruining this. I'm, I'm mad at y'all Ain't finished. This ain't ain. I'm you killed dude's kid and wife and it's shut it up.


No, I'm And Then called him with some type of reprieve. No, stop, stop It. That's not happening with life. They would fly until you kill my wife. I'm a rock with we You killed my wife and my kid. That'll Usually do it. Yeah. Once he, she killed the wife. My kid You killed my wife for no reason. Just because you ain't like her attitude at the No. 'cause she, she assaulted you at the repas. She assaulted her. She said, yo, do you think Conrad has to sleep with this every night? Ugh. He has to fuck her Assaulted you because we're at my son's funeral that y'all killed. Allegedly You Killed my son. Allegedly Not allegedly Killed son Because it was alleged initially. Nigga they know you killed Son. They didn't know that until until after they killed the wife and everybody got on the phone and the son said, I chopped your Boy up real fine.


They didn't know it at first. Could somebody call you after your son and wife is murdered and say Richard? No. No. The sex would've to be absolutely insane for you to answer that calling. It's not coochie that good in the world. What's up? It ain't, That's the only part in the story for me that was just tough to get with. But I still enjoyed it. It was a few. It was a few. I still enjoyed it. I still enjoyed it. Mob Mobing was pretty cool. What else needs our attention outside of tv? Shit. Where'd my phone at d Duke. Duke to God. Duke, Dennis. Yo. You what dog? No you didn't Duke Dennis and shout out Duke to God word.


That's my word. Shout out to Duke. That's my era. That's why I'm like, what the fuck? I ain't never trying to dis Duke to God. Duke to God introduced me to Arab. I think shout to Arab Duke. Dennis Duke. Dennis has children. Yes. Okay. Is that true Jeremy or fact checker? It is true. He did. Yes he did. He has kids. He Didn't say say how many, he didn't say all of it, but there's like speculation that he had six children every year it gets brought up on stream allegedly that he has a new, that he has. This Is not a super important topic and one that we probably normally wouldn't even cover. But it's so funny and it, it did take over my timeline until DDG took over Duke.


Dennis is the streamer dude who all of the ladies were going crazy over because he's an attractive man. But Reli Shout him out. His song, He's a part of A and p. But how a lot of casual people learned about him for at least a year, women were going crazy over Duke Dennis. True. Yes. Then they learned he had kids. How many kids? It is a lot of kids. Six. Six. I've had all kind of numbers by how many people? Six. A lot of people. Yeah. And then women Tur totally turned on him. Yes. All of a sudden he was not attractive. They started saying shit like, oh, he a nasty dick all around town nigga.


And you 31 hanging around kicking. They just, all the insults came out now because they learned the Duke. Dennis has kids. Are you familiar with this? I'm looking him up right now. Yo. Yo. When you pull out your scope though, I gotta stop talking about it because it's, you have, but when you can't, when you pull the scope out on talk to these I playing Scorpio, big Scorpio vibes. Anyway, what do you guys think about Duke Dennis having children and women changing how they feel about you based on the amount of kids you have and the amount of baby mothers that you have. Are are men allowed to do that to them? Oh, That's one too.


What do we, what do you mean? What do we think? That he has kids. He has kids. He has children. The amount of children is, you know, that's the lifestyle That he's living. It became a TikTok trend. Girls started lying saying they was his baby mama. Yeah. It's, it's a lifestyle. And then some of the baby mamas came out and started talking about him as a parent, which I won't do, but yeah, I won't. It is become a thing is all I'm saying. I think it's hilarious. The women turned on him online. They started taking out, That's the part that makes it funny. Finding Pictures him without I'm with It is, like I said, they found picture without my man, without his glasses trying to roast him and stuff like that. Yeah. They called him glasses fish. It went, That went like a hundred million views on that one. Picture glasses. Yeah, they was trying to do all that man. I mean He did look a little different without a glasses.


I mean, when you, yo listen when you're younger and you, and you inspired to be to live a rockstar lifestyle and you, and you finally catch a a moment man, you just gonna live the lifestyle. Whether it's right, wrong or indifferent, you just living a lifestyle. And now hopefully that this has came to the surface, he could reevaluate how he's treating the mother of his children. If That mothers, I will give y'all a piece of advice that my OG dollar deal gave me in 95, 96 when I used to see something fine. And he, and he would say, do you think you are the first gentleman to notice that she was fine?


Yeah. Nah, nah. Not her. Not usually. Not that. That's fine. Somebody better had seen that before me. So she got a couple kids. She on wic, she niggas run, niggas eating them WIC snacks. Juicy. Juicy. So why do the girls think that they, the first people to notice that this nigga was fine, somebody noticed before you and let him shoot it up like you would. So what the hell's the problem here? I don't think there's necessarily a problem. I mean I've definitely, you know, in the past found somebody attractive and then found out that they had like seven children and Lord Jesus, you know, That's you spam.


Okay. Found out that they had like seven children from five women. And I was like, okay, pass doesn't really, what would the number be? Like if it was both me I, ideal situation for me, if It was three, would that be okay? Seven was too much. You love the guy, three kids? Oh no, no. There's no, there's no love yet. I I just, I've seen you and I'm mildly interested. Okay. Okay. And then How many kids is too many kids for a guy to date? Melyssa Ford. Yeah. Oh. I mean there's different variables now because of like, you Know, well I'm asking now. I'm not asking back in the day At this, at this stage of my life, I understand that men have probably, you know, had long-term relationships and have children.


So, But they should be grown in a way now. Hopefully. Hopefully. 'cause if you got like newborns or like two years old and Nope, nope, nope, nope. New. I prefer them to be like in their teens I'd be Oh, stepmom. But yeah, I wish you would walk through the house. My stepmom. You Girl Can do that. Your search go crazy. What? Fucking, oh lord.

Do you think ice could if he wanted to and he set his mind to it, jump into a whole bunch of other outside ventures? Yes. And he has but I mean commit, like really commit as many as he committed to it. If he could have 10 on the table, if he could have 10, how many think he'll pursue? Okay, I get what you're saying.


That's the all Got it. Answer that. If I had two probably like two. Two probably two. Yeah. Probably two, two out 10. He just, and I know that yo he he yo I have opportunities now that I I I get at my, he's getting mad at myself. Okay, so let me, Let me put, hold Up for a second. We asked Ish why he's answered procrastination. Why for you He's in a soft man era. Yo, let Him in. I just wanna Love it.


Niggas a whole triple dad. He just hear. Honestly I don't think I have the time and I know that sounds crazy. I know it sounds crazy. I think it's for both of us. I can't speak for him. I'm just going by my, let me Give let me give give you guys fear too. Let give you a definition. Fear. Fear. Fear plays a part in that Some part Fear plays a huge part. Fear of success. Fear of what though? Success And failure. Failure at the same time. Yeah, I think, I think fears of success and failure play a part for the Ain't I don I don't have a fear of failure. I don because I shit and fail maybe success, I fear failing that I keep wanting to do more and more and more. So I don't feel You are ambitious. An ambitious person is someone who is, who has a strong desire for success, achievement and recognition.


They are driven and motivated to reach their goals often setting high standards for themselves. An ambition ambitious individual is determined and willing to work hard to achieve their aspirations. So yeah. I don I don't hear we Ambitious by that definition. Me or flip. I thought, I thought she was talking about he said he No, I said, I said I'm not I know, But but she Said you are. No, I was saying, oh, Flip is not in question. Yeah. Flip is Jeremy. I would say a nine. The, the only reason I wouldn't put myself as at a 10 is like, I'm not willing to sit there and do this 24 hours a day. I'm willing to do 15, 16, you know, most of my time goes towards advancing myself.


What can I bring to the world? How can I use my gift to, to reach the highest heights I possibly can, but I'm not willing to stream for 24 hours. You know, I still Am the Fuck that. Fuck you get to a nine. He said the only reason It is not a 10 is because of Yeah. Oh yeah. It is scared. Let me add, let add, let me add real quick. The other reason why is because I'm not selfish enough. That's true. That's why I'm sitting here thinking about it. That plays a role. I put everybody else's shit in front of Mine. When it comes to, when it comes to ambitious, oftentimes ruthlessness is ac company. You, but you know what, in order to be successful, you, you Have to be you to step selfish on some motherfucking necks. Selfish. I just learned that like you have to be selfish. You have to in order to be successful.


That's not true. In order to get to the next level. Well if you follow and abide by some principles and morals that you live by, I wouldn't say Have to I would say it, it comes, they go hand in hand. Yeah. If you, okay. I think you also like, Come on Paul. You know what I'm saying? You, I understand what you're saying. I mean, I be saying it right, but there's, There's thing as being too democratic for sure. There's a lot of times where opportunity, Someone has to take the reins. There's a lot of times where opportunity will be right in front of you and because you may like a person or this is my man, you won't take it. And when they take it, you're still behind. Oh yeah, I've seen things like that. I think a bigger thing is like, well at least for me It is trying to bring other people along. And Did you say your number?


No, lifetime scale of one 10, right? Yeah. Now 15 today. Probably like a seven and a half, eight. Got it. Got it, got it. And, and tell me your number again. I forgot. I said, she said seven. I said seven because you said six. No, I said seven. No, He said You are six. He said, he said I'm six and a pop. I was just talking shit. Yeah, but I'm seven because in in, in terms of like my scale of values ambition isn't, I don't even know if it cracks top 10. You know, I, there's so many other values that I place higher on the list and in terms of peace, and That's a pretty privilege you did For, I mean maybe yeah, maybe, but also I equate ambition with ruthlessness because of what I've witnessed being in this industry for 25 years.


The most ambitious and the most, generally speaking, the most ambitious and successful people I've ever witnessed that super driven, stepped on Motherfuckers to Get it. That's all the fuck over them. Like just right on rungs on the ladder. See, I, I ain't got let me to do that. I disagree. But it's just lived experience. Your experience is your experience. And I just, she right, she's right. The things that I've witnessed. I'm just like, success does not mean enough to me to do things like that. She, you've Been around them billionaire niggas, But I, but see, see that's one view and she's right Based on her experience. And I have another question in closing and she has more questions for us. So One more thing. Some people look at their success as being unselfish in that I'm doing all of these things for other people.


I get that. You understand what I'm saying? Some people doing that shit for themselves and their own recognition and their own conceitedness or arrogance or whatever the case may be. Some people like, yo, I'm busting my ass and I'm selfless so that all these other people that rely on me can have a better life than myself real quick. So it depends on what motivation that's the, in justifying the means type of situation there. But in the moment you have to be a little selfish. You have to like put the goal first. You have to, if I'm trying to become successful, I have to leave a little bit of shit behind. Like I said before, if I didn't, like I live where I live just because I'm closer to my daughter. If Didn didn't, I found out where you live too. My mom told me I ain't hide it from Y'all, but I didn't know you lived over there.


Boy, They stop. Those start. It's nice. Right? All. Alright, Man. That's the new shit. That's, I know, I know where you live. I'm coming over down, man. I didn't know that you was doing it like that. I'll be over there, nigga. The three bedrooms over there that the old one either? No, no. It's the new one. The new one. New new, new New. Ain't the old one. Yeah. That wasn't there when I grew, grew up. But go ahead. You saying So Yeah, you, you have, you knew he lived there. Of course. You know, I ain't know. My mom started over. I Used to live right there. Say where? Oh, I'm driving over there. Oh, you crazy. That nigga in my hood. Alright, go ahead. But yeah, you just, I just, you have to be selfish That my, my, my final question to y'all before I toss the melody here, which she had to say specifically y'all.


'cause the number was low. Y'all don't have nobody that, that can push you through that or that you could lean on when you're not feeling so ambitious. Right. Like sometimes I don't feel the greatest and I could rely on Ian to fucking have a good month and pull, wait till I get back in my, I could rely on my girl might push me sometimes. Hey baby, like y don't have nobody to push you or recognize when you're not feeling so ambitious and try to help or is that just, I got a y'all thing? No, I don't to be answer your question. I got people that definitely try and push me. I don't speak to 'em often enough For the push to be effective. Yeah. Got it. Got it. I I do, I do have a couple people, but honestly they don't even, they don't know.


Yeah, They don't know. They have no idea. Got it. Got it. Big male. I have people, but they, No, I meant for your questions. You had, oh, okay. Your number was high. I'm not asking. Okay. Did you answer Joe? What was your Number? Shit, one of 'em gonna call me as soon as he see this. Thousand, Hundreds, thousands. I I refuse to even be limited to the nines and tens of this. Do you think that ambition wise? Oh, Oh yeah. Sure. For sure, for sure. Do you Think that too Now I don't def I don't think that at all. I think now I I don't even think it's a six. I don't think that's fair. I think y'all are projecting what you want him to do as opposed to what he wants him to do. Yeah, but no, that's not, that's a, that's a part of it. If you see this is the thing.


The people that push you see something in you that you may not see in yourself. So, so to push you I see. I'm gonna just take it to some things that he said he wants to do. He ain't embark on them and he right there and can do it. But he won't do it out. Fear. Nah. You projecting. No, I'm not. I think that's projecting. No, I'm not. Like I sat, It is not My shot. No, no. So can't be projecting you. I've sat here and said that I would try my hand to stand up comedy. I don't think I'm not doing why Ain't Buy no real estate yet? No. Why ain't invest in real estate yet? Like develop on a bigger scale? It's a simple answer. This is a very simple answer because You, yeah, maybe.


I don't know. So, and Nobody knows it until you put step off the ledge. Nobody don't have enough knowledge to go down. I don't think that speaks to my ambition because I'm buying a bunch of real estate. My portfolio looks amazing. But nevermind. It Don't look like you saying You think it should Look. No, the things that you said you want to do is what I'm saying. The shit that you buying is easy. It's effortless. It's effortless. I think that's pretty, it requires no effort. You needed the effort to make the money in order to buy the stuff to Buy. I know, but that's, That's my, I think that's privilege. That's my point. I think that's privilege. That's my point. It's like an athlete, right? You might make $50 million a year playing basketball. You put in the effort to get good enough at the craft of basketball to attain this amount of money.


But you might say y'all want to go and learn how to do X, y, and Z. You not necessarily taking the hours that it takes to go learn X, Y, and Z. But the the basketball shit is a layup for you. Nobody Intended. Wait, but I'm wait, I'm with you. I'm with you here. But that's because my hours, it ain't like my hours, my hours pissed me are dedicated. I'm serious though. That's not true. But lemme tell you, But Lemme tell. I think that my hours today, most of them are dedicated to my goals. One to 10. One to 10 yours. I think he's a Seven. Thank you. What he did yesterday. Thank you. I'm I'm taking off you what he did yesterday. I know that he, that part of him, he could be more ambitious and that's a part of his, his personality has to embrace.


I agree. That's a flaw. I don't even know. It's not a flaw that speaks to ambition. You gotta Work on them. All of the flaws that we have in our personality, I'm shy by nature. Yeah. The people that know me know I'm shy by nature. I don't talk to to strangers. I don't talk to people, nigga. You gotta step outside of that personality trait that you have to get what you want to get. And those things like what Corey is talking about, a million of them have come in your path and you turn them down all the time. Yeah. I just don't look at it as a lack of No, no, that's right. I'm ambitiously chasing something else else. So I'm not doing that right now. But I understand what y'all are saying. I don't, I don't really Agree with that. And I don't know if I'll ever get to a point core where oh no, where Maybe I will let, let me, let me not say that.


Look. But Kenya, I did it. I went de fix yesterday. I got on the jet, I went to the shit they offered to pay. I said no, we'll, we'll do it. I showed up. I sat in the middle like a fish in a fish tank. Everybody who was anybody was able to come say hello, shoot the shit. They were patron patroling, they were fans. They loved y'all. They loved me. They had stories, some like when I was a rapper and it was smile. And I'm not good at that. That's not uncomfortable. That's not, I'm not comfortable. Wow. The fact that you, that's just the fact that did That shit is fired. Yeah. That, that you, that ain't you. I can't say that without ever be comfortable at that. But I don't want to put But you took a step to what I would be comfortable at And you might get comfortable if blah, blah, blah came out and said, yo, we wanna give you 50 mil to do X, y and Z.


This is a part of what we gotta do. I want you to meet the, And if anybody out there would like to offer me 50 million to provide services, to be uncomfortable, feel free to call Brother Schwartzman and, and discuss Come And you'll be on 10 that day. Because Steven a win cracked. They, they, they kicked Michelle Beatle out of out Sirius for Steven A and they got a little beef. So that's funny. But Steven a just got 25 mil annually from Sirius for his show to go on top of the hundred that he got from that he just got. So Steve a might be at call Anthony Town's money now, which I would be too if Paul Rosenberg didn't have any black ball from Sirius.


It is cool. The alternate route is a long one, but indeed it'll get you to the same place. Congratulations to Steven A. Smith and all you niggas out there getting a bag, running it up. I see y'all. I see y'all salute to y'all. Mel, your questions. Well, when I was at the birthday dinner, you know, we kind of went around the table and you know, just said a bunch of nice shit and stuff like that. But we asked each other some questions and I was like, huh, I'm gonna bring that to the guys on the pod. 'cause it, I feel like it will make you kind of introspective but also kind of allow yourself, allow yourself to congratulate yourself if you know, whatever. So one of the questions was what are you most proud of having happened this year so far?


We're like halfway through the year. So the three questions were where do you think, where do you see room for improvement? What are you most looking forward to this year? Or has it already happened? And what are you most proud of yourself for having done or completed this year? Three part question. Yeah, kind of. Sort of. Yeah. What are we most proud of? What do we, what are you most proud of, of where do you see room for improvement and what are you most looking forward to? Or has it already happened and what was it I'm most proud of? I'll start a New York time to think I'm, I'm probably most proud of my kids Today.


Today. Like that's probably where, it's funny, I just had that talk with my dad this morning where he was like, Yeah man, I need to go make a run. But I was like, dad, you can go anywhere and you and that you want in the world. Like It is fine. I know You think it is, but you could pick anywhere in the world and just go like, I got you. And he said, Joey, it ain't even about that. Like, my joy today is for my kids and one day you'll understand that. And I said to him, I'm already there so I feel you. But just watching my sons gain understanding or lose understanding of the world and humans and people. That's probably what I'm most proud of, where I could improve 10, 11 years, 12 years into this pod and think I could still learn when to shut the fuck up.


That's Introspective. Watching y'all. That's intro watching y'all. That's introspective. No, That's that. Don't snicker. No, that's a good one. I'll take it out on y'all. I'm Episode I'll take it out on You on a few episode. Seven episodes down the line. Niggas just coming firing, But no on the, on the playback. And we've been adding mics. It's been a rotating cast for the most part. And how you show up is should, how I show up shouldn't be the same in each instance. And I'm still working on that so I can improve in that. What was the, what was the final question? No, where where do you, Oh yeah, what do, what are you most looking forward to? Oh yeah. What are you most looking forward to Talk? Can't say Just no, you gonna know actually, hey, there'll be signs.


There still will be signs. I can't, I can't say, but It is something I'm pretty much looking forward to. Okay. Should, should be soon. Any, any day. Will everyone know what It is When it happens though? They'll be like, get That's what Hey Jeremy Hecht. Jeremy Hecht A fucking, There won't be no denying what's going on in a conversation. This is what No, no. They'll no. I'm gonna try to lie too. I am gonna try to lie but pay intuitive. Y'all's go try me Flip. Go ahead.


What am I most proud of? My family. Okay. My family is what I'm most proud of. How do they let you move around? What, What's the second one? Oh, that Was damn the short answer, right? No, my family. My family is what I'm most proud of. Man. What do you need to Improve? See, See. Hold on, chill out. Now I'm watching my daughter become the woman that she's growing up to be. That she doesn't let my behavior influenced her thinking just how she just thinks of her own and stands on her own and she's willing to check me on something just as a, a 15-year-old turning and 16 when she's like, oh daddy, you bugging. That means a lot to me. Watching my son jr just be around me every step of the way.


Even though he wants to live his life, but just still own choice. Making a sacrifice. Watch your mouth. He does have a choice. Still making the sacrifice that he makes and just Nico being a badass kid, that should remind me of myself. You know, Nico's bad. Yeah. Watch your mouth. He said pause to you. What, what, what was the second one, ma'am? Room for improvement. Room for improvement. Just being, listening more. Listening more. Not thinking I'm a know it all. Willing to take advice. Being more willing to just get more understanding. I mean, we protect what we create, but even with that protection, there is some flaws in the creation. If you are in a bubble, a lot of times I'm in a bubble creating without having, you know, getting outside forces.


So I I really wanna listen more. It is Right because you don't listen to me and, And get comfortable. Well I started to Lil Wayne, I started to, I started to listen to you. I made some moves. Me and you had a talk last week. I made some moves. As soon as you had a talk with me about the studio. I made some moves. You, I'm, I'm, I'm talking to you. Do listen to. So Yeah.

You said you got Imani locked in? Yeah. And what's the third one? What are you most looking forward to? I'm looking forward into taking the flip your view and when I'm doing just to the next, to the next level with JR. Just, just being the father and son duo and actually getting him on the camera to get me comfortable and putting my family in front of the camera.


Next, you know, when I, when I turn 40, I just, I just want to switch things up. So these next two years is very important to me when it comes to working. So I'm looking forward to where it's going. You know what I mean? Stability. Yeah. Shut the fuck out. Shut the, yo. That's financial abuse. Yo, that's like financial mental abuse. Yo. Like I be doing that shit JR. Yeah, right. Yeah. Stability.

Little merger, mergers and acquisitions. Right. Little m and a M and a. We Gotta talk man. You though that's overdue. Leave alone Improvement. I could get out of my own way with regards to some of that shit. Like the ambitious shit or embarking on new shit.


Attempting new shit. I could get outta my own way with that kind of sabotaging some of the shit I could be getting into where I'm going. I just had some good meetings. I think I, I'm gonna push it. Did you take off to Hammer? Uhuh. Okay. I gotta at it because I see 'em, I see him, me trying to see, I mean you Can't say that To people. I gotta ask though. This guy's An idiot. No, I, I I, I had some good meetings. I think some, some bigger development shit is on the horizon, so that's dope. But and that's where I wanna be in that lane.


So I think that's dope. I think that's promising. Yeah, that's Good. Shit. All give us some advanced notice though. For what? Before it pops off. I don't Gotta go nowhere. Let us No, no, right here. Just let us like what you just did like couple days. Yeah, I don I wouldn't do that anyway but yeah, that's not why. But I don't gotta go Nowhere. Got a Jeremy, I gotta keep eye on him. I'm good. Thank You for eyeing that guy right there. Freeze nuts. Most proud of course. Look at us bonding and shit. I don wanna use the same answer everybody. This is, that's why I ain't, I ain't use it's a hell. Corey says I didn use The family shit motherfucker Specifically. So that's why I ain't do it. I am, I am. But It is, It is family for me. Yeah.

I'm fuck you up where I can improve.


Seriously. Taking more initiative, yo. It is, It is. I got a lot of opportunities that come right to me and I just, because it means I'm going to miss time from doing this or being there for my family or being here. I let shit slide and I, I again, It is back to that shit. Stop putting everybody else before me. I'm, I'm really trying to work on that. Listening to y'all. It sound like if y'all ambition level wasn't at a three, y'all would be outta here. Yeah, I know. I know for a fact. That's what it Sounds like. Like I'm off, I'm bugging it. Sound like y'all got a lot of opportunities coming your way. Be Careful. No, yeah, I'm talking when I say outta here.

I don't even want to participate in this really. I don't like to dwell in the past. So yeah, It is gay. I'm proud of everything that I do and everything. I'm mostly proud of what my friends and family members are doing more so than my own personal accomplishments. 'cause I'm always gonna work hard and that's kind of that.


Oh Yeah. I'm proud of this skincare Routine. The skincare routine. My girls got me on, I'm like 10 days in. I feel like my shit's glowing a little. I'm just a little, I don't know how the cameras make it look. You Look good. Thank you. Thank you. But no, I, I am extremely proud to be here today. I'm not just saying that. 'cause all you guys are here, obviously that helps. But I remember like seven, eight years ago listening to the podcast on the way to an internship that I hated being like, this is what I look forward to every morning, you know, every day. And to be here literally in the moment, having a conversation, God is great. So I'm very proud of myself for the work. Thank you.


You Took to us Game. Yeah. And I could improve on being more the same work that I do for others and the same energy I put into others. Putting it into myself. Yes. I feel like I've helped build a lot of people up, a lot of companies, up a lot of brands up a lot of channels up and, and I've done a lot for a lot of people. And when it comes to me, I always push it off and I'm like, ah, you know, I I don't need to do that for myself. That video can wait, that my YouTube channel can wait, whatever it may be for myself can wait. And so I think putting more energy into me and I know like what you guys have done, where you've done Joe with your, you know, enterprise, your network is super inspiring. So more, more energy into me and then yeah, looking forward to whatever, whatever the rest of the year brings.


Thank you man. Make some noise for joining. Thank you guys. Elliott is taking care of you over there with the up rocks. Did everybody Yeah, Everybody. It was the first, first Let's Pocket watch for a little bit now. No, it, it was the first time in, in a long time when Up rocks took over Hiphop dx where, you know, shout out to my boss Jared and Elliot. They just saw what I was doing and they said go. 'cause before that it was a lot of, you know, stay over there, stay in your lane, you know, you could do that little thing over there, but don't get to when, When I don't care about that. When, when do you, when do you get to Reapproach in the negotiations? So I'm, I'm technically on a work visa. I'm Canadian as you know, so I Didn't know. Oh, you didn't know? I had no idea. Oh yeah, so I'm, I'm from Winnipeg, Canada, actually.


Okay. Get outta here. Yeah, so, you know, they're, they're, they're helping me, you know, stay in the country and work H one B. I'm on H one B right now currently, you know. Yeah, you I Didn. That was the one I was on. Yeah. So, you know, I asked him about his work contract boy and he started telling me about His work visa because he, because he's not, he's smart. He's smart. He's smart. He's smart. Yo, We good. Very Thankful to be in the country right now. And you know, in the future maybe there'll be some renegotiations, but right now I'm very Happy. Damn. Hell No. You gotta go get with Julian now. Hell, you Bo it. Oh man. Get out. You and Julian got get out there in that shed. Boy. Shout out.


Stop Jeremy and Julian. Shout. He did the reverse. I did the reverse. Wait a second. Oh, I got him mature. That's foolish. That's dope. All right, what else? What else is important? What else needs our attention in here? Let's see. Timberland signs a AI artists. I don't know if y'all care about that. No, let's talk about the Pacers. Yeah. Don't say Okay. Yeah, don't say what? Shout out to the Pacers. No. Yeah. I ain't coming to make jokes. I I ain't coming to make no jokes. Listen out Pacers. Shout to the Pacers. Halliburton does it again. I left that game at halftime 'cause I'm leaving PrizePicks in Atlanta, so I'm trying to get home.


But the shock on my face when Keib shows me the final score and the Pacers won in the first half. They had 19 turnovers. I think the line that I saw was 16 and a half for the game. They just didn't look the greatest in the first half. But the thunder were, were never able to take off. It was always an 11 to 13. I think it ballooned to 15 at one point, 15, 16. But they were never able to take off. And as a Nick fan, I've seen that movie before. So it was eerily similar to game one of the Knicks as a Knick fan, I'm also validated that they went and did that to the Thunder. I don't, I don't know if Tib feels the same. I know he curses somebody out right now.


Oh yeah. But shout to the Pacers. They've won game one in every series. So, and the line was nine and a half. People were expecting a thunder blowout. But so congratulations to the Pacers. I wanna start with that. Secondly, I think the NBA is doing a horrendous job at the finals. And that's outside of small market teams. How so? It's only been one game. I don't care. I wouldn't give a fuck. No, explain, explain. The finals is your final. Right. So I mean, if you old enough to remember the NBA on NBC and what they did for the finals, you would damn near see a monologue for each team and their journey to get to the finals.


They don't do that anymore. Fine. Maybe I was busy in PrizePicks. I didn't see player intros that resembled the finals. They didn't have NBA finals written on the fucking court like my entire life. That that was special. That was special when we saw I didn they did not. I'm positive. And you know what? They ain't even have it on the jerseys. I'll take it a step further. They didn't put the Larry O'Brien trophy in the middle of center court like they started doing. It is inexcusable for playing games courts to look better than NBA finals courts. Yeah. I don't think there's an excuse for that. And Adam Sil was doing a horrific job with how the finals are being presented, how the finals are being covered.


They not treating this like the creme de la creme of your sport. And I just think it's a mistake that's outside of the small market shit. I get that you got your YouTube money, so maybe you don't really give a fuck. But the finals is a big deal and if it ain't, you should make it look like a big deal. This should look Like a big deal. So, no, it's a big deal. That's, That's, that's, that's what I got for that. Congratulations to the Pacers. They've made this a series for the people that thought it wouldn't be one. And I'm a believer. Ty Halliburton, I mean Tyree, Halliburton four for five on tying or go ahead baskets in the clutch in just this postseason. None of us have ever seen anything like that. So I think it's time to get 'em some props. And I'm, I'm here to do so I, I told people from the rip I said that I did think OKC was gonna take the series, but I ain't think, I still think that, I didn't think it was gonna be a layup for them.


Like I think Indiana matches up pretty well with them outside of the bigs. I think Indiana is just as quick as them. They defend The bigs wasn't on the court for that final offensive possession for the Thunder. You and I agree with that. That was a mistake. Shaa shot that shot. There was nobody get a revamp, No bound, no nothing. Yep. I think that, I think that Indiana is just as deep, if not deeper. I think Indiana defends well and they shoot the three, well a lot of them could shoot the three. And that was the thing that I said Well we got a little more grit too. Yeah. I Said I don know, I don dunno about that. I said that the Thunder had some of that cavalier in them where they a young team. So you're gonna expect them to resemble a young team at some point with A, with a superstar.


Yo, They, the Pacers had 25 turnovers. The thunder had 11 points off 'em. You're not gonna win like that. You're not gonna Win. And the pacer shot amazingly and the thunder didn't shoot well. So even though they were getting all these turnovers, they still were shooting a shitty percentage at the half. Yeah. Like they weren't up by amazing, You know what I mean? At the half the game looked like it was a, a runaway, but it really, really, really wasn't. I think that coaching is gonna come into play it in this series more than, than I think Carlisle did it again. Carl. Carl, he, he coached, he's the fuck of a game. No, he's a monster in the, in the, in the timeout. He said, yo, you get the defensive rebound. I'm not calling the timeout. Even though they had one. We just running this shit and you see Halliburton begging for the ball, went to the right, got to a sweet spot, mid range hit, hit the mini, got the bucket.


Like I was watching that shit live. I couldn't believe it. I watched the whole shit live. I didn't turn yo, I had to pee. I was just sitting there like, I'm gonna hold it like this is some bullshit. They not gonna do it again. 'cause at one point it was just 10 11, 10 11, they couldn't break 10. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? The fourth quarter, it was just 10 points. 10 points, 10 points. They shot a three to cut it to seven. I was like, okay. They, they, It is something different now. So I think Indiana deserves all the kudos in the world. All the kudos in the world. I'm blaming the fucking stupid ass players in the league for calling this nigga the most underrated player. Overrated the most over when the most overrated league. The most overrated. And when we gotta go see about the dude. No, seriously.


It is something to be said about that after I order this Strom bowl. Let me play. So Play. I thought you were looking at stats. I thought you were out there looking at player stats. I'm trying to time the food to Get here at a certain time. No, let me, let me play this clip because again, I enjoy, I enjoy Halliburton when he speaks and, and he finally got honest after they stole game one. And I like people talking about his voice keeps changing. I like that too. Where's my Halliburton clip? Like to hear it, it hear it, it go After you have a run like last year, then you get swept in Easter college finals. He just keep it at a bean. Right now. All the Conversation is about his, how you don't belong there and how you lucked out to get there and that it was a fluke.


Guys are gonna be pissed off. We're gonna spend the summer pissed off. And then you come into the year with all the talk around how was a fluke? You have an unsuccessful first couple months and now that's easy for everybody to clown you and talk about you in a negative way. No, Joe Biden As a group, we take everything personal, like as a group. It's not just me, it's, it's everybody. You know? I feel like that's the DNA of this group. And that's not just me, that's our coaching staff does a great job of making us aware of what's being said. Us as players. We talk about in the locker room, we talk about it on the plane. We're a young team, so we probably spend more time on social media than we should. But I just think we do a great job of taking things personal and that gives this group more confidence.


You know, and we turn things around in January, which you guys know and we just stuck with it. I'm really proud of, we just all got each other's back and then at every, every point, Shut up nigga shit sounded great. Right? He's absolutely great. Right. Inspiring. Hearing him explain that like makes sense. You totally get it. I like, I like that. I like that. Also, before I toss to my distinguished cast the fall off of Doris Burke as an announcer needs to be studied. Stop. True. She's a goat though. She's A Come on dog. If y'all don't want to have to talk, we don't have to have No, 'cause I I there's not, there's nobody has to bigger Doris Burke fan and me.


I love Doris Burke. Yo, she's been horrendous this off season. I mean this playoffs, if you keep talking, I'm gonna find clips. She has been absolutely horrendous this off season. I mean this, this play. Why do I keep saying I've seen her a few times. I don't know if I necessarily look. They made the announcement burg not guaranteed to return to lead ESPN's top broadcasting team in 25, 26. You don't fucking say hold, hold back. She older. I I ain't watching much of Here we go. Hold up. Oh much about, and there's contact on the elbow. This is why he's called the free throw merchant. Every player in the league Can do this. They lit up for that.


This is from the wolves and there's contact on the and Thunder series. This is why he's called the Free throw Merchant. That's not the one that here we go about History. But I know the French and German don't like one another. And Rudy says Bojo, Mr. Hart and Stein have a little bit of that left-handed dunk much about history. I was watching again when she said French and German don't like one another. And Rudy says Bojo. Mr. Hart and Stein have a little bit of that left-handed. Have a little bit of that left hand. Lemme tell you what the advertisers probably didn't want to hear while they were watching the, the, the findings. The French and the German. The Germans don't like each other. Don't like each other. That's snow picky. No it ain't. No It is not. I don't think that was horrible.


It was a little corny, but I was Always, yeah, I was watching Line in particular will cost her her broadcasting job. That one line and that presentation of a basketball play is gonna cost her entire job. Are you crazy? You kidding? That is not how we Present. That's not what's so bad about that. It's horrendous basketball coverage. We not then That matter if these announcers be having some cringey fucking Yeah, I, Reggie Miller's been having cringey fucking He's bunch. He's Been shit for 20 years doing That. That that's offended anybody. Like do we need to get into fucking race wars now? That'ss not race wars in the basketball.


Hey, let's see if she's back next year. I'm, I'm not, I'm not. But it might not be because of that. But She has not been, this has not been her greatest display is what I'm saying. That's possible. I I I just love Doris Burke. But me too. She's replacing Mike Breen and j Jeff Van Gundy. I know. They should have never fired Van Gundy being cheap. Well, I'd like Jeff ain to be a next coach candidate. So, so I'm gonna shut up anyway. Back to y'all And, and y'all what y'all thought about the game, the finals? No, I just thought, I thought, I thought, to be honest with you, I think these NBA playoffs have been amazing. They really have. I think these NBA playoffs have been, I you could see the parody in the teams. Usually. It, it wasn't that many just runaway series with sweeps and shit.


Even most of the, the favorites lost to underdogs. Indiana was the underdog to Cleveland. When you say the playoffs have been amazing, I don't think that applies for the, for the Western Conference. I could see how you say that on the east. I disagree. The thunder got, they injured Ja Morant. So we had a Ja Morant list first round. Okay. Yeah. That Denver series was impeccable. Denver Series went to seven was Amazing. They, they, they made quick work of the wolves. And now we'll see how this goes. But Wolves clippers, who? The Clippers lawsuit the wolves, right? Yeah. That Clippers lawsuit clippers long to D Wolves people.


Lakers. Yeah. You are correct. Yeah. Pardon? Right. I think the Clippers were an amazing team in the Western conference. I had them high up there. It is just unfortunately they ran into a buzz saw. But I think the Clippers were good. I think the wolves were good. I think in a bunch of these series there was just, it wasn't a blah, You know what I mean? Agreed. Like it wasn't a block to, there was a reason to watch outside of the Lakers, and I'm a Laker fan. I didn't think the Lake Lakers had the chance to winning. But outside of that, I thought that everybody played exceptionally well. And I think it was a bunch of close, close close games. It was a bunch, a few blows. But I think overall the series were a lot of crazy comebacks. Yeah. I, this guy Pascal aka is getting the love he deserves.


Former Raptor, he was getting shit on for a long time. They were saying he was overrated. Highly underrated. They were saying he wa didn't develop enough. He's not a superstar. And he, I blame the commentators for that too. I highly that too. The commentators said that AKA should, should be a first option. But he failed at that. So he needs to learn how to be a better second option. Frank went there was about to play the Knicks. Say a word. Wait right here. All right. And then he went off 42 on you. 38 or Yeah, like Mike said at every last dance. And then I took that personal and that was enough. That was enough. Nah, aka is balling. I'm happy for Al Turner. That Nim Hart cross dribble, tween, tween.


No, no, no. Jab Stack back up. Let me hit you with it again. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Step back. Swam. See that's the problem with the picture. Nim Hart going turn into Kyrie at the end of the game. Won too and hit some shots that he just, It is like, what the fuck, what the fuck On, on the man after y'all got a little push and match going? 'cause they both from Canada too. Yep. They both from Canada. So it was one play where Nihar foul Shaa and Shaa pushed him. Nihar walked to the foul line and pushed him back. He's going to shoot foul. Fuck you talking about Also having nothing to do with basketball. That that SGA post game, whatever he was wearing was tucked in. But you seen it still, it was a lot going on up under that shirt.


I ain't See that. And he had the, the pearls going across. He looked like somebody that's about careful. You started sound a Little Beasley Ish. That's how you want, you weren't dressed like SGA yo. I think if you had it, you, you weren't dressed like SGI think SG is one of the best dressed players. I you want to be him On the low. He he, he looked like somebody that had 700 million a year in the future on his radar. Which is what they're talking about. Rumored for his supermax. Eventually He's a 10 on the ambition scale. He's sick. Halliburton is gonna pay for that. That cute shit he did last night. When that's g came back. Hey, we Said that against the next too. I'm not counting, I'm not counting him out.


Yo. He, he not After what I saw last night. He and Jalen Brunson that fourth quarter. You can't take nothing away from Dylan Brunson. Yeah. In the fourth you'd be like a motherf again. Halliburton is different than that fourth quarter bro. Yo Nick fans out there. I'm gonna say this in closing. I know we still distraught over the Tims firing. It is a lot of rumors going around and false misinformation being spread. Some of which says that Rick Brunson players are unhappy with Rick, Rick Brunson and want him removed from the team. And some of y'all fans Is pump pump pumping that up? I'm here to tell you grave mistake. Grave grave mistake pumping that up to the best contract in the NBA.


If he go to his son's bedroom and talk and then he demand a trade. Don't everybody going don't Let a tear fall. Do what the fuck is wrong with these niggas? Y'all bark up that tree, that tree will fall on you. Yo, I just don't like the way they was treating me son. Rick Brunson. Y'all want Rick Brunson removed? All right nigga. All right. It is gonna be him and his fucking kid Nigga. And I'm gonna come in here and read, read every point guard that has played for the niggas in the last 25 years And his son is college homies with the other three. They Added it. Yeah. The college homies is out. What? Go Back, back to vi No reclass. Yeah. And anyway, stupid. That's my, that's my sports report.


I don't have anything else in sports. I got one thing that it pains me to. Yeah, right. Welcome to Pittsburgh. You right. What? I don't want that nigga there. I've been saying this from day One. You ain't want Mason Rudolph starting. Yeah. I fam I don't want Aaron Rogers. I never, I told y'all last year. You did say that. I've been saying that that shit. I hear you. It's the rest option right now. I mean outside of Yeah. Of Of, of the bullshit that y'all done to lead us up to this. It is the best option Now you left yourself with no other option. One thing that nigga could do, You could still sling the rocks a little bit. Throw that ball. Yeah. I'll be curious to see How, I think he'll have a good year. Yeah, Me too. I hope he, I hope, I hope they do. I don't know how his leadership is gonna be really, Really curious.


'cause he does things his way as we m right down the street and Tomlin does not play that shit If he's there in the 10th round of my fantasy. I'm getting him as a backup 10th Because I think niggas gonna play with him and leave. Yeah. About 10th. Oh yeah. 10th. Oh yeah. Quarterbacks And if he's there at backup quarterback positions. Very important in fantasy. It is For when your starter want to act cute or Go get hurt. No for when your backup want to turn up Get crazy. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. When your backup be fucking, what's my man from Minnesota? Kurt Cousins. Oh yeah. You start getting Kurt Cousins as your number two and he start acting like a one A. Yeah. Sam Don will be doing that shit too. Talking about, yeah. He be going off on some backup shit that fucking run Joe Flocko had with Cleveland.


Somebody was, he Went crazy. He was lighting me up. Good wave of wire pick. That is our sports report. We have yet to del in the Trump. And real quick, What the sports, what do y'all think about the NBA Allstar game next year being USA versus the world instead of East West? I'm cheering for world. That's fire. I think that, I think it's, they needed to do something because everybody was fucking bored as shit with the all star game. Nobody cared. They tried everything else. They did. Yeah. That's So now they gotta tug on your pride. That's fucked up patriotism and shit. I just think, listen, I understand trying to come up with something new. So I would be tired if we get cooked though. I don't think Adam Silver has watched the foreign players in the during All Star weekend.


That's true. Yeah. I totally disagree with you on parts them foreign niggas, with the exception of a few of them, they don't give a fuck about All Star weekend. It's egregious. Yoic might not show up. He's The main culprit. Oh, I see what you're saying. Luca. I will never forget they passed him the ball from the inbound And he shot that Shit from the other team. Free throw lines. See that He was dead. He saying, and this is what I think. Oh, okay. I think, I think, I think their pride Freaking Them niggas, I think they probably gonna come out Are women. Yana, I think their Shay. Yeah. Luca Embi.


Well they be not mbi. Yeah. If he's, if he's got two letters Players with pride better outnumbers the dude better outnumber the dudes that don't give a fuck because none of the American niggas like the attention that the foreign niggas be getting. And I think it's gonna be coming personal game. Think It is gonna personal. Now we get a, I think it's gonna be personal. The only thing I don't like about this is with this format, you're, you're announcing that you're robbing some people of their All Star spots. Mm Mm Yeah. How? Because you have to fulfill a a, a world roster And a USA roster. So people that might but, but people that might not have made the world roster will make it just to fill up a team. Yep. Maybe the USA not so much, but the world roster.


'cause it's not enough. I think both sides. Both sides got got old niggas. Yeah. Man, you fans be picking that shit. The old niggas be making it fans just pick the starters. I like it. I'm also interested to see how inside the NBA looks on ESPN without them having NBA rights to games. What does that look like without y'all being able to show me the game? So we'll see about that. That'll be podding basically. Yeah. ESPN. Not having the rights to games just sounds funny, but whatever. We'll see. We do have to cover Elon and Trump for a second. I know you guys want to go enjoy your Friday nights, but we got at least another nine hours in this bitch.


17. At least another nine. Especially these niggas got opportunities that might change their life coming. Hell you Shit. I need nine more hours outta y'all two before some deal gets signed. Yeah. Do y'all care? Hello? Trump. Trump. Trump and Elon. Man, the the bromance fell apart in the messiest way possible. Yeah. They said this is the Drake and Kendrick beef for Republicans. Yeah, I like that. Yesterday on Twitter, I saw people going crazy's funny. That's funny. Back and forth Because half of the party kind of did pick a side. They picked a side. And I think I, I think this is more telling, I think that a lot of Republicans really don't fuck with Donald Trump.


Like I think they really don't fuck with Donald Trump and they just been too scared to come public with it. Agreed. That's been case for, for a while. Yeah. They don't fuck with him. And I think that Elon is right and I think the Elon fanboy helped him win the election this year and possibly some Other things. And some money and some money and, And $280 million. You know what I mean? I think that, I think, I think Eli, I mean Elon, pardon me, did get a little big in his britches and forgot that he was talking to a narcissistic motherfucker and Donald Trump that you not gonna just come in here and just keep publicly big broing me. I don't think that's gonna keep happening. I'd like y'all to break this down for me and like I'm a kindergartner, but I agree with that tenfold at least for a year.


And no, at least for six months, Elon is seen to be getting too big for Britches as it pertained to Trump. Man, they was running around saying that he was the one running the Country. For real. They were. Because it looked like that. It did look like that. Yeah, bro, I'm in, I'm in the Oval Office. What With some sweatpants. He ain't have no sweatpants but him. Nobody comes in the Oval Office dressed down like they going to dinner. Right? Like, yo, you in there with your kid, your kid telling the president, shut up publicly. Elon set this off with the debt they win or the debt plan. He said that the bill that they just passed, the bill that they just passed was trash. A lot of people are saying the bill that they just, the big Beautiful Bill Donald Trump caught the big beautiful bill Pertaining to everything.


A bunch of shit. Mad shit. So the budget, shit. A lot of the budget shit. So Elon came forward and said, yo dog, not for nothing, no disrespect. This bill is trash. This bill is gonna add. They're saying way more money to our deficit. Donald Trump and them said, it's not public. People that are in support of Donald Trump have come out against the bill. Kevin O'Leary, who's Donald Trump's man from Shark Tank, Mr. Wonderful. He said, this bill is horrible for all small businesses. He said basically, 62% of small businesses are the driving force to our economy. You shitting on them. So he's like, yo dog, my people gonna be calling me like, yo, what the fuck is going on? So Donald Trump and them of course said, no, it's not.


It's helping small businesses. The tax cuts to the 1% are enormous. Again, they're saying that it's some future shit that's going on where people that are making under $30,000 a year are gonna get hammered in taxes. Like if you already at under 30 grand, no disrespecting nobody out there like, yo fam, you can't afford no more tax hits. Okay. You know what I'm saying? So it would, it just, and so the motherfuckers that are being truthful saying, yo, this is some bullshit. So I I have a brief summation from like New York Times. I love, all right, here we go. Hold on. Shit. Rewind. Come on. Yeah. You've been killing since that whole take Fridays off thing too.


Shut the fuck up. Never seen anything quite like this. Elon And I had a great relationship. I don't know it went well anymore. So last week, Elon Musk left government. It was the end of his tenure as a special government employee. He got this nice press conference with Donald Trump in the Oval Office. Thank you Elon. Thank you. Thank you, Thank you. But behind the scenes, it didn't seem that everything was going well. Over the weekend, president Trump removed the nomination of a key musk ally from the head of nasa. And throughout this week, Elon Musk has been posting about this supposed big beautiful bill that Donald Trump has been trying to push through Congress. And he's expressed his worry about this bill adding to the federal deficit and increasing the federal debt.


And on Thursday he Became a little bit different. Donald Trump addressed that kind of rhetoric. He Knew every aspect of this bill. He knew it better than almost anybody. See that's what I was wondering, which To explode online. Musk unloaded his full clip on Donald Trump accusing him of being associated with Jeffrey Epstein. He talked about how Trump's tariffs were gonna be bad for the economy and lead us to recession. I don't think we've ever seen Joe Biden someone at this level fall out with Donald Trump. You know, in some ways Elon Musk is his equal. Someone who is incredibly wealthy and someone who has taken Credit For a lot. I don't see them as equal. Trump's Wins. Both men are known for. Are You getting his opinion now? All right. We don't win. I don't see them as equal.


Why? Why? I mean, Elon Musk is way richer than Donald Trump. Well, Richard, but power, powerful Influence. Power Influence. Yeah. Power means a lot. He does, I'm, I'm thinking on the power tip, But Elon basically with wealth comes power. So, but Elon basically said in his tweets, he was just like, I got this motherfucker elected like I did. Thank you for your service. Yeah. He's like, you, You, you, you so rich and wealthy and, and intuitive and, And you ain't doing me a favor. I'm waiting for him to say that Donald, they rigged the election. Well Don think he's all but said it. Donald Trump is just a New York nigga. That's it. And what I mean is that we'll let you feel like you got all you inside and we all cool and chummy.


Chummy. And It is all great and it's all good. But in the back of my mind, I'm watching you and I have a plan just in case you get a little bit too comfortable. I would agree. And that's what John, he played Possum Trump. Played possum, made Elon Musk get extremely comfortable and then wham and showed him that. 'cause he, he been saying things in the beginning. If Elon Musk tried to run against me, well, you know, he's not even from this country. He's been saying things and he got quiet. So then Trump just showed him, man, never, you know, I could play possum better than anybody. You know, I got, I got 50 years dealing in the swamps. Yeah. Nigga down with the mafia from the mafia to talking about this. Like, yo dog, I've been with them. Yeah. It is different. I've been with them. You just a a a, a wealthy dude.


That's a genius. And your genius And You and a dork and the goof, you goof. So when we need the money and when we need the tools and the assets and resources, then we'll call you. But other than that, nah, you ain't Nah. Trump's narcissism is, is is one of my favorite reality shows because I can bank on him doing Something more serious To act like he fly with Pence for the rumors to go around yo, when Pence ain't over, yada yada. And then Big T saying, nigga never the case You done. So he does this. He does, he does. So when him and Elon Musk was acting like friendly, friendly, friendly. And Elon Musk didn't see it coming, I was like, oh, this is happening.


Yeah, he It is. He didn't see it coming at all time. He was none wiser. I Don't think so. And I think it, the relationship was mutually beneficial. Like Honestly speaking, definitely. You can't say Donald Trump was no corny nigga in the eighties. He wasn't no corny nigga son. He condo was himy for Huh? He was corny. No, he wasn't, he was not corny. No, I don't wanna defend him. I mean Either I'm Saying I'm just, but in the Eighties, I'm just being honest. Donald Trump Was, he was him. Okay. In eighties, nineties. Donald Trump was him. Like he was running around here. Playboy nigga, like Iron Man or some shit, you know what I'm saying? And then his other views started to cloud. Honestly, if he never runs for president of the United States, he continues on that trajectory of, of being one of the, the cool whites.


Unfortunately. Alright, we Now No, I'm just saying because a bunch of that shit would've never come, come out publicly that he did when he started running for then people started going to search and find some of the little racially motivated shit that he was doing. But Donald Trump was a cool ass white dude running around billionaire, messing with all the baddies back when we was coming up. If I have to pick between the, the which evil I like more, I'm picking Trump over Elon Musk. Absolutely. Sorry buddy. I I am absolutely sorry. Sounds bad. No, Don't. I'm with you. I'm not fucking with those fucking doofy ass Elon Musk. I'm with you. And I don't fuck with Trump, but Elon Musk. Me neither.


Yo. So it's funny. So he says, yo, I'm about to drop the big bomb. But I think that was a mistake. If this is your big bomb, I don't think it went the way you planned. Yo Trump is on the Epstein tapes. We, we like Well we knew that. We knew that. But why? You didn't know that He did. No, you knew that too. Oh no, you did know that. And good with it. And ain't say nothing. Y'all started beefing. Yeah. Yeah. And if you did, why did you keep working for his people's question? Your man came out. He the king goof. Who? Kanye. Oh Yeah. Oh, I'm not even doing No bros. Please stop. We love of you guys. Yeah, that's what he Said. Yeah. But he been, he sucked a lot of dick. Yeah.


Yo, What the fuck is wrong with you? Because literally what's, literally, you can't say he did. Don't tell me what to say. He did suck a lot of dick. I'm not telling you To say no. You Can say whatever you, his cousin, his uncle, or some shit. You can't suck. Yeah. Again, talk about that. You can't suck your fucking uncle Dick and then chime in when the president's going, your cousin, you can't do that. You can't because now it look like you rushing to suck another dick. Mind your fucking business. You not a politician. We are not checking the album. You lost the gap. Deal. Sit down. Enough of you lost Amber Nigga. Move move. It's over. You lost the white girl. Move. We don't want hear that right now. White and black. We wanna see the titans. It is a big fight. Here you come. Making it about you. You are a different class of narcissists.


You gotta move. Wait for a second. We've been waiting for this for a while. Sorry, Kanye. It's not about You right now. Mm. How, how does this end? Like, what is, what is a possible result of this? Nothing. Come On. You ain't gonna find another Trump? No. No, No. Not yet. Not yet. We No way how that goes. I don't think he's done. No, no, no, no, no, no. Trumpet el laws. I, I think Trump pulls a bunch of that money. 'cause that's some of the shit it gotta do with some of the money. The government contracts. Yeah. Okay. Is it true He stopped signing the contracts for the Elon shit. The, You start pulling my money. We gonna start beefing a little bit. Yo, you, you might have made some promises to me that I, I need you to follow through on.


And now that you out, this is all speculative. Now that you out here fucking with the motherfuckers in UAE and you got some other heavy hitter money niggas behind you, you don't necessarily gotta sit down and, and, and, and, and kiss my ass no more. Trump said the easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars is to terminate Elon's government subsidies and contracts. I told you, I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it. Told you. Then he went on to say, hold on. What is this Shit? Big, big politics, boy. Yeah. He says, I don't mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago. This is one of the greatest bills ever presented to Congress.

Just it Look Easy.


It is Kate the Lucky Daye Look Easy. I see you repping for the Canadian man. There you Go. Ka Canadian. Ka is Canadian. Lucky Daye. Yeah. Yeah. And it was five And gay. It's Pro. It's primo. That's So I what you were saying. Okay, Y'all always think y'all gotta stop Kare and Lucky Daye I've stepped away but that It is Fire. Fire. That sounds fire. It Was fire. Yeah it was cute. Was little Summertime vibe Almost to hers. Know the Lucky Daye in her joint. We The summer It is her. I wish she hurry. Oh no I don't wish she hurry up. Take your time. I ain't rushing greatness when she come.


It is going be And we're summer too. Supposed To be. She talking very start. She we should get something new from her. She got the single Her probably waiting to step on summer. Everybody not like you yo. Everybody, you yo don't matter out there right there at the moment. Yeah, You right. Don't, nah, nah, nah. Nothing. Nah, aint nah, nah nah, nah. Nothing. Her better be aware of when Summer would like to drop. She don't have to. Yes you do. Why? No she Don't. They're different. Different. It is a little bit. You could buy two albums. They're different than what Right. Demos Levels you could buy. I don't know how different the demos are. What do you think the, the demos are?


I think her's a little bit more earthy. Earthy and like appeals to adults a little bit more. I think Summer's a little bit more. Man. Her got the secret earthy holes. Summer got the overt earthy holes. Okay. Okay. I'm saying I, this is what I'm Saying. That's different. That's Different because I'm just talking shit in a pot. I I think that summer will probably break 300,000 units week one and whoever. Yes. And keep going. Yes. And her, what'd she do last time? I think she was close last time. Was she? Oh we Sleeping last I think. But we can look it up. And I think that's Lot. And I think that any, I think you need to be aware of anybody that can do 300 week one.


Why would anybody have to, why did they have to choose? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Summer ain't ain't do nothing near that. I remember her, her shit being hella low. She did 166,000. Yeah. 1 66. Where'd I get 300? That About her. Her didn't do 300. Hers was hella low. Oh Her was mad low. 'cause that was a topic here for a while. She might did like 50,000 or something like that. It was Low. Okay. Well I could see summer breaking two 50 then. Let me bring it down. Nah, Shit. You think she's hotter than another than she was before going into the last album? I don't, that's a good point. I don't, I don't think that her album sells week one will be predicated on heat. I think summer is out of the, I gotta be hot to say. See I think once you start talking to anything over 200 heat, it's predicated on heat.


Nah, I thought Jeezy coulda did two 50 when his heat was gone. I'm, I'm taking it to ancient dinosaur time. Yeah, We're talking that's a whole different Yeah, I think Summer could do two 50. I think honestly if you're talking anything over one 50, it gotta have some heat. I think 1 50, 1 50 for summer. So you think she goes down A little bit? Yeah, I think she does too. Oh y'all got so but fucked up. I love, I love, I love summer. I just don't think she, I think she's been quiet. Worry. Don't worry you. She will learn you. This is like that Wayne in this prime thing. Y'all doing it again? Yeah. Hey, before we leave, can y'all stand on? Just stand on the fact that you said it and I'll shut up. I didn't say he was in his prime. I said he has plateaued but Don't worry, I'm gonna go back.


But The plateau, you gotta still be at your prime level, right? Like you go up and then left off. Yeah, Because the argument was peak versus plateau. I think he, I think he was spitting. I think He still raps extremely Well. Yeah, I think he was Spitting. I just think that his Production production, Which You right. Falls on him. I think Wayne can still put out an album on the level of those other albums that we love him for. But he needs the right team. He has the talent to still do it. There's artists that don't have that talent anymore no matter what team you put 'em with. And I don't put Wayne in that category. I'm, I agree with what he's saying. I agree with the niggas that make this cereal with the milk first. I don't know any of those people. I'm Just, I don, I don Ice Cube make put ice in his milk too.


Corey do that Shit. He put ice in his shit too. That's Corey shit with the ice in the milk. My mother do that shit. You do that shit. I used to, when I Ate cereal, no freeze. He, he in a Soft Guy Era. So he warmed the milk up. I believe that he warmed the milk in the microwave. Put some honey in it. Yeah, you are heathing yo Big freeze. You free. Is it bad for men to have like a soft, is there a Soft Guy Era for men? Yes. Nigga now? Yeah, I'm in it right now. I'm in, I'm in it too. Freeze is in it. I just love my family. I just want to chill home. I don that's it. I don't care about the World album was my girl was talking to me so rough the other day. I just was like Rough as in message or tone? Tone. Just like, oh the old. Oh yeah.


You be like, oh that, that's 'cause she know your foot ain't healed all the way yet. Hilarious. You can't move it so fast. I don't need my mouth is a whole boy. We can see. I just like, yo, you can see tongue, we can see. Look. I'm just like, yo, you got it. The old me, I Don need to let her have It. I wanna be in my Soft Guy Era. My wife too, nigga. She was talking, You're in your soft, Soft Guy Era for sure. But he's not. But you got the shorts On maybe. Maybe soft shorts on maybe. Yeah. Right. Salmon, salmon. Sal, Sal. You gotta put the S that nigga Lululemon is in the Soft Guy Era maybe Soft guy. Soft era means something different than for men than it does for women then. Oh it does. For sure. Yeah. It gotta mean, So what does it mean for men Then?


Less gardening For women? It means like you letting the, the man take control. You don't want nothing to do with that for the men. You just want to be pampered and taken care of nice. Oh, okay. That's what the women, that's it. Right? For women. For The women, yeah. Women just want to be aloof and not worry about nothing and be led by a man strong enough to where they're able to be their soft self and not have to wear the hardcore exterior and that they present with. I think for men it just means not fucking, Not doing too much. I'm grinding your hands to the nubs. Yeah. For men It is just being rich. Just relax. Well, I guess that's a way to put it Leads to it though. If you, If you rich Ben, I guess. Okay. Yeah.


That's, That's crazy. That is kind of, that's disgusting. I guess it also could be, if you find a sugar mama, you could be a Soft guy still. It involves money. Well, I think soft. I think that always involves money. But If you, that's Soft girl era does not involve necessarily Sugar Mama involve money. We'll add another hour to this podcast. Okay. Nope. If you lie like that, I'm not Are you kidding? You're full of shit, Mel. Come on. For Real. It doesn't. Yes, It is specifically about that. No It's not. No it ain't specifically. But it goes look hand and fucking big hand in little hand. Kidding. Cousins. They real close. Close Real Close. No, they're, they're They West Virginia. They're In the room with each other.


They're in the room. Now explain yourself before we end. Okay. They're, they're in the room with each other. But it doesn't necessarily mean that when women, when women are saying, you know, like, you know, I feel comfortable to be my softest self. It is because I feel a sense of security. You know? How do you think What provides the security? JP I'm Not doing, I'm not doing that. The Mel, y'all listen to Mel. I ordered food already. I ate, I'm good. IY niggas, I already ordered some food. So no, it just, it just offers a woman the chance to, to be her softest self and feel like she is secure in her relationship. Not Worried about anything. Right. You know, just not worried about anything.


Mel, what girl is with a broke nigga is in her soft girl. What girl is Secure? I, I personally don't Know what woman that don't have to worry about anything. One of those things is financial stuff. So when you don't have financial cares or worries, then that means that homeboy has stepped in and taken that worry away from you. That's maybe one way of looking at it, but not necessarily What's the other way. That's just one of the things. What's the other way to look at it? Okay, I'll put it to you like this. I have a girlfriend who was very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very fucking tough. Her exterior, everything about her was just combat and fucking fight because no motherfucker ever made her feel confident enough person for you, confident and comfortable and, and allow where she could feel vulnerable and feel like he wasn't gonna go anywhere.


So the man that she ended up marrying him, marrying, that's what he did for her. He made her feel soft and secure and that no matter how she showed up, no matter what insecurity she displayed was Hebrew. He wasn't going anywhere. He was No, no he was not. I don't even know He wasn't, bro. I Don't even know how. Yo, Thank you for your contribution today. Honestly, that Jordan did this Really great. I feel big. We could help amplify the woman voice today. You had enough, You've had enough of the woman voice. I got It. No, no. We always wanna help amplify the woman voice. You did it.

Tell us what Jay-Z did. Nah, nah, nah. I saying you know what the real problem is with Wayne and this is Yeah, He's been fine in studios. No, no It is honestly. It is. It is. That's funny though. That's funny. Wayne don't rap about shit. That's really what It is. Yo. I was about to say that song that we just heard, he wasn't spitting nothing crazy. The raps from the earlier album that we heard are much better than those. But on that album he did. He did have no, he Went crazy. He had concepts, Did very, very, Dr. Carter, not a lot though. That's not a lot on Carter three. Yes. He had Like Dr, You know, way more about way the mean. But Carter three was, he had conceptual album songs on that album. A couple of songs. Overall he does not rap about shit.


And it's hard to stay current and do that when you just putting words out there and putting words together. Just rapping. You just rapping. Just rapping. You just rapping to a beat. He's basically in this, oh they ain't gonna kill me. It's almost close into the pot. Ain't gonna hear this Shit. No. He basically is Eminem, just not as technical. M do that just at a very technical level. You were right. They are gonna kill you. M does it too. Just technical putting work Together. Hey Tanner. No, no, no. Hey Tanner, you We good? We good?

He named a Wayne Hook that he did. And I'm like, you could still be a great rapper. Not being able to do hooks. Okay. And picking A hook or a feature hook is not, I'm talking about you doing, I don remember the era I was, I was around for the era where producers are saying to get a Jay-Z placement send him a beat with a hook on It. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Don't, its okay To say that Don't nothing away from that. It Don't take it at All. Well then I'm talking about It is talent to know that Let Let identifying a good hook.
