That's the other part. Love I'm telling You, it's not the same time. That's the other part about love. I'd be shocked when she don't uphold the values of, of what? Be Phony nigga. What did she do? Double standards nigga. And our argue house. Our argue house. I'm with the double standards. I am Too. Look man, I'm in trouble again. So yeah, good stalking. As much as I'm against this, this falls under good stalking. What? I just don't think you should do it. Nikki's too big. No, I think, I think it falls more under, If you, if one of your exes fucking had potential and really met that shit, you gotta, you lose.


But it's not stalking you Lose Your ex is on arena towards, they brought her back out, she finished the arena tour, sold out everything she did. Album sold. They called her back out nigga as a mom and a wife. So, so thinking went into that. Don't come up here and play. Don't come up here and play. Not here. Come it up. Said you coulda did it without letting even. Yeah, I I think you did it for the, he did that. He was attention what you call her shit, click baby. Yeah. Cl chasing, clap chasing. Yeah. If it's, I think he Did that. If it's an isolated, but I also do think he was proud. I, I believe that both could true, but there's a way to be proud without doing the attention season. Stalking would consider more than once. Like it's isolated. It is one time. So I don't think it was stalking. I think that he was just, I And he playful on some, you know.


Oh, I don't, I don't even think he was proud. Think stalking would be like three. He's or four shows. Or two or three. Then are you stalking though? I think that this was just, just to be funny. What Do you think that was? Like him knocking her? I don't know that that's true. What? What? As far as the stalking charge applies, but I don't want sound knowledge. Oh I don't know. It can't be one. So one time you can get a stalking Charge if that person can prove that you are not supposed to be here. Don't be here and are only here for to harass me, then Yeah, I think they can put that charge on you. The law experts out there could let me know. Please let us know please. But I sure enough went to Papa CTO's one time. I wasn't just popping up to Papa CTO's like that on.


It was one time. Yep. This nigga is outside of Papa CTO's in a hood and 90 degree weather and across the street. 77. His 90 cigarette, 90 cigarette. He on his 90th cigarette. Yes. And I don't feel like that's normal. They coming to get you the fuck outta this you stadium look. So we that's a wee bit different. Look, that's a wee Bit different. I don't wanna sound knowledgeable though. Yeah. What happened? Him going to the concert, It is not harassing Nah, It. It's no, no, no, no bitch. And she ain't gonna do that. She see, she she gonna handle it with street justice. Yes. Yeah. She ain't, She's not calling the police.


Him going to the concert is not, the concert is not harassing her. But it's corny that when you took that moment and made it about you. I agree. No I agree. You could. You could've did that without the V without all of that. Yeah, but C OE gets your ass s whoop too. How'd She find out that he was there? He put it public like he's like he puts that out. Put It public. Okay. So like he's in the concert and he's Like Yeah other think entertainers don't see nothing, huh? Well I mean she's on the stage. No, She on the stage. He did prior crew of people prior To. He said he was going, he, he did it prior to Now we looking vest, I'm going to the show now the fans are gonna see me. I'm wearing a vest. I'm doing Attention. So did pre post vlogging. That's Why none of this had to do with any genuine being proud of her shit. I wanted to go there to make a fucking spectacle.


Yeah. If I wanted to go there on some real proud moment shit. And even if you weren't proud, you've been about it, weren't proud about her, you were proud that you were attached to those moments. So it's still about you. Yeah. Yes. You would still be proud of I was proud of her. That's way to This show. I was about to say yo, I think that's to do that from where they came from, he might feel some genuine and sincere proudness for her. So To showcase that you do it in a genuine, sincere Way, you don't do it this way. I'm, look, I'm not disagreeing with that piece at all. I'm agreeing with you. I think it was clout Chay, but I think that deep down inside he's probably mad proud of her. Both can be true. Yeah. Maybe. Yeah, I agree. Safari is a friend of the show. Nikki is a friend of the show.


I'm gonna wish them both. Well Safari you gotta be careful when you, when you're doing the lighthearted stalk, you gotta be careful. That's all I'm saying. True. That nigga Kenneth look like you all Of all of us stop stalking, right? We don't do the lightweight stalk no more, right? No weight. No, I don't think so. Yeah, we do the no weight stalking. Yeah. Oh y'all think that you can't do it 'cause y'all all in relationships. No, You can stalk her too. Oh, Okay. I'm just checking. Oh, Oh. Yeah, you can still stalk your GirlTalk her page. That's crazy. You can Disney. My carol Stalking me. Think mine too. But it's cool. I nigga yo I Don't, as long as they don't ever talk Oh Shit.


I don't want to get, It is so stupid. Yo. But it's only for content. I know. It is only I content and It is only because I, I keep it squeaky clean outside of the content.

Ish, New York. It's only one place to party in New York on nigga I'm gonna say it. I Wanna go to the lit spot. I'm gonna say it 'cause these niggas don't wanna say it. Y'all jail nigga. You are. They're married. You are able to do things like that nigga. Nigga go back and get your wife. You able to go and pop? No he missed the combo Greenhouse nigga. It's only one spot nigga. I wasn't married. It's only one spot popping on Tuesdays nigga.


I'm On both sides of this so I don't wanna make a whole bunch of jokes. Got it. You married. I do feel like you should be, you Could go get your wife. Yeah Go get your wife back By any means necessary. Not by Don. Not by any means that that's Too long. I'm just saying some people that believe in love are in the no matter what club and we're gonna uphold our vows even when it gets difficult. That's not so After all that shit Fuck that talking on Yeah that's not exactly And after all that shit talking you did online. Well that's why I'm on the other side of Both of them. If you want to keep your marriage you do have to behave a certain way. True. So it's such a personal matter. I don't really want to comment on that this situation. But I do understand both sides Man let's speak like niggas Do it.


Nigga was out there yo. And if anybody over they get too handsy. Yeah B nigga. That's nigga that's your wife. I told y'all though and we not gonna argue, I told you that you gotta play with your partner differently if they have a different level of cache. And this is only what I mean because if you thought your wife was chump, like if you thought your wife couldn't get shit shaken out there, you wouldn't need to pop up to nana house or the club. That's a fact to that. You say what? That's Not true. That's a fact. Let me hear them expound On it. So what I say to That is the same thing I said in the initial argument. I think he's seeing something right now. He's seeing a side that He ain't never seen before. Exactly. Like now I might believe Oh Shit shit like So then you agree with me.


So why would you On the other side of the nobody think she's chu you not marrying her if you think she's chu with nobody was saying chump nothing about that. No you're not marrying her if you think she's chu he don't think she's chu he's in love with her. Yeah he put babies in her. Exactly. He don't think she's Trump. What are we talking about? I don't Think he put babies and bitches that we don't love every day. He Didn't marry, we didn't marry them and put multiple in 'em. That's true. So I'm not talking about that. Those are Different. He don't think she trump nigga I'm out here playing around and got caught playing around now I gotta I gotta find a new bag that I gotta do to get my girl back That's find a new bag to get his girl back. What are we talking about? But Oh Shit don't work no more. Yeah. Let me find something new to to to try to get her Back. But the fucking shit that he was firing off before, like when this whole story fucking that's ego Shit.


Ego. Yeah. That they both were firing 'cause she just put some shit out like yo that's still my nigga or something like that. Yes she did. She said yo that's my, that was old or that wasn't this. Oh that wasn't, no, no that wasn't new. It just resurfaced. So that goes back to my question about when do you as a man check your ego. Exactly because he was sounding so go ahead. I was gonna say he just sound, he was sounding so fucking cavalier about the whole thing reducing her to baby mama. Yeah I feel like y'all, I feel like y'all on that check it when we had that argument was on the side of niggas half egos for a reason and if you keep coming back there's no reason for me to relinquish it. Correct. I'm saying as you do the good stalk when you found out the club that your girl is hosting at, you don't do it with your ego leading first.


No I don't think he's in ego mode anymore. No He's saying I'm telling you, you agree with me. I'm not agreeing with you. I'm saying that He Ego was there at first and now I'm seeing some shit that I've never seen before. I might really lose her not before where it was we and dance she'll be back. This Aint that. You looking at me. Stop. I don't want to go on my stefon digs ran again 'cause my girl just took her ass to the, the Texans game as soon as I did it. No threw Stefon Diggs tickets like alright go God boy listen, God must be guarded. This Is a far cry from what y'all were saying like last week. That's What I saying. It's not, it's not get no it's not nigga true. No it's not gotta, it's not be true. It's not. It's because you guys were talking about the past behavior and the past behavior is you always came back.


That's all I fucking know. And now there's an acknowledgement of like, oh wait, hold on. She might not Hold on, hold on. Yeah. Shit. She really actually moving different and this does not look normal. Yeah. You can't play both sides of the fence. Exactly. Why gotta Pick a nigga you when you've been bunny hopping over the gate the whole entire time. What I, what I'm telling you is when he got on that stage and did the grand jury gesture, it worked. What's the difference in him doing a grand jury gesture? Now We are here. I just have to take it bigger and better. That notice just happened, right. I might have had to buy one carrot before then I had to buy Lambo, then I might gotta do this I gotta do that. I can answer you. Shoot. I think that's fair. Cool. That's it. We've done the tricks before when we've had to pull the rabbit out the hat and go on stage and get our girl back and it worked.


So we applaud him for that. Cool. Okay. If we're talking about that, I'm on y'all side. Okay. We talking about 90 million times later where this the, the It is new tricks going. New tricks to a new cat. It's a, It's a bunch of rabbits out here Joe. It's a bunch of Hats. You don't want those rappers. It's not. See and that's what you said before, you want your wife Wait how Do we notice it's Not gonna work in different behavior. No it might. It works. This conversation is mute. Hold on, hold on. Ish This shit just happened a month ago. Yesterday. Yeah, yesterday. We don't know if he's now realizing, okay, what had worked before ain't gonna work today. So now Lemme go ahead. There's also one part y'all keep overlooking just from the public side.


She, she fuck somebody else. Exactly. We don't have, We don don't Brian saying that we don't That for sure No. you Don know That for sure she said and did bro. Cool. Not the and did and at least in his mind she fucked somebody. He's, we've never seen that part before. Exactly. Me and my girl could go through it. Whatever, whatever. We have our fallout, we come back, I do whatever I gotta do in that time. I never knew that she went and fuck somebody else. He's under the impression like okay so now you're moving different. This is something I've never seen before so now I might really be losing the chick. We go and left flip clothes. I don't want us to beat this down. Yeah, okay. All of this stuff is the stuff that's coming out in the public, there's probably so much other shit we don't fucking knows. Interact Offset. And Cardi might be sleeping in the same bed right now.

If I, if I fuck 70 girls and your girl, fuck one dude. Yeah. It is gonna hurt the most. Well she did hurts. What You talking? You know why I don't want to continue to have this argument with y'all because Cardi is a Libra and I do believe that he's gonna get her back. Connie's solid more than a Libra. She just, She's just, She gonna get her back. She's Solid. She's solid. It's just who she is And she's the wife. Let's do that. Yes. And she's solid. She know the game I was So I'm not gonna keep having this talk with y'all but I'm way on the other side of wherever y'all stand at in regards to how, how niggas But joke, if you have something valuable out there To hold on it, Hold it that do what you need to do to Percent.

No listen, He didn't want Holly Berry. Listen to what I'm telling you. He didn't want Holly niggas cheat on, cheat on today. Y'all saying that, saying that we all are all in agreement. Y'all are saying that Cardi B, Cardi B is above being cheated on. Never. And that's what we all sat on and said No I'm never saying that.


Y'all said He should cheat differently. Y'all did say that. That's literally what child, Y'all bringing up her social status as a marker for him not to cheat. And I'm saying if the lady was a School teacher that's not and she was a principal's not, that's not what they said. Yes they did. No that's not, We don't Need need to harp on it. We did it for three hours then. Then if you think that's what we said then let me, let me rephrase it then. You shouldn't do that. If That is the person that you wanna be with a Thousand percent regardless of how much money she got or her status. So then we fought for nothing then No The whole don we fight for quite a bit of let's move forward. But the whole point that would be made was Let's move forward.

So I'm gonna give him mercy because I can squash him like a fucking black eyed pea in my hand if I fucking felt like it.


He doesn't even know who the fuck you talking to. Yeah I'm talking to You. right. You on bullshit. Act like it. That's bullshit. Sometimes I be on bullshit. Acknowledge it. It can. We just said acknowledge you're bullshit. As long as I be on bullshit Now what move if you ain't with the bullshit, go to the tree house nigga. I'll hit you when I get back to home base. See you didn't move out. Put a nigga in the tree house nigga the tree house. The fuck they talking to you See? Nah, you a nigga that don't care if we get jumped when you get jumped. No but I would.

No. Or how about don't Do nothing two, I'm with that piece a thousand I you talking about No but you could. Okay wait. It Seems like y'all are unclear and then I'm toss right to you. It seems like y'all are unclear long ago I made the life choice be cool with people Or Or Or Or pod and take the things that come with Podding. I took the red pill. You I don't care. And that's what DDG needs to know some people when you get my age, don't give a Fuck That Quincy about Who you are, where you from, how you dress, how you smell.


I don't give a fuck about none of that shit. I walked in my dad house, my little brother Anthony ran in there and said Joe, what happened with DDG? And I said Nigga fuck DDG. Wait you think you could my brother we could talk. Huh? My oldest son called me yesterday. He said Dad, he said, what's up man? He said, I'm coming to work with you tomorrow to see you flame up DDG. And we laughed and I hung up. Then I thought I might be setting a bad example. That's a horrible example.


But I do like that everybody that's important to me know what time It is when It, it's digital warfare time nigga went and followed my girl. You offered the kids some snacks. Oh okay. You giving a little bit more information. Okay In the stream. Listen, I spoke to ak, I called AK 'cause I seen act do a little, do a little Joe button, DDG thing and I called AK and I said nigga I don't care that that's your man Fuck that nigga. And then AK gave me some information about DDG which I didn't have before, which I honestly respected one and two.


I wasn't mad at it. Can we ask what It is? I wasn't mad at it. Act explained to me that he sees similarities in DDG and myself. I said well what might those be? He says the DDG seems to be caught between music and content space. He said he's someone much like you. That was early on the internet, early with the vlogs. He had a run on Vine. He was able to move that audience much like you over to YouTube and he got popping on YouTube early and kind of paved the way for some of the streamers that you know today. He said and then he stopped with all the money that he was making.


He decided to stop for whatever reason and pursue a career in music and he's passionate about it but he's being viewed a certain way because that people think he's corny or people think he's immature or people think whatever they think. So access, he's fighting through some things right now and he's doing the best he can and the relationship with Holly might not have helped because you get with this superstar girl because you might be a good dude and he said he is got some girls before. So a guy put some respect on his name. It's not just Ruby. He said he is moved around out there. I appreciate that much like myself who did that as a corny broke nigga. So I identify.


So he said he got what the girls helped them like gave them the blueprint to kind of help become what some of them have became. And he said he is doing his music now and he's just facing backlash from a a fan base that's much larger than his saying yo you ain't shit you didn't deserve her, yada yada y. So now he just got a uphill battle I felt for that. I did okay, I did okay. So I was like oh man, not the worst guy. So then I watched him as he spent the next three days attempting to flame me up. And even in his flaming of not just me but y'all too, he was kind to Melyssa.


He only shouted her a little bit. He said you a girl so I'm not gonna kill you. Thank you. I do appreciate that in digital warfare. That's nice. It means you may be a little immature but you not all the way stupid. Also he's put some younger kids on some members of his family that are doing really well. Yeah, JR was telling me that. Yeah little kid. Yeah my little brother told me, even in him following my girl and doing all of that C Emanny cloudy shit, he kept the kids out of it. He kept my girl out of it. He kept my baby moms out of it. He tried but for the most part it was a fair, it was a fair little more whatever he is doing and the same way I don't know shit about him, he clearly don't know shit about me.


So do I want to come in here and use my powers for evil and fucking just end this nigga for sending all these bots my way. And he got a emoji, they was putting some little, they was putting something. I was like, oh look at you. You go, you go, you go. Yeah. So, so I wanna do, I do want to have a little bit of mercy film like he clearly is just a little immature and maybe have been tagged LA but at at 27 I was immature and tag lane so I ain't gonna kill the guy. What I will say is younger people, when y'all do the whole, hey old nigga shut up.


You niggas is old, yada yada yada yada. You gonna die. You got 10 years, 15, it's not a flex. 15 years It is not the flex that You think it is. And boy if any human had that superpower bottle it up, put it in Walmart only God can look at somebody and say when they life expectancy is gonna be up number one. And number two, you young niggas is dying at a much higher clip than niggas my age. I keep telling facts so I don't want to come on here and like perpetuate that type of energy. Do I think I could beat the doggone dog shit out of DDG whenever I felt like it. Yes. Do I feel like that DDG can't talk none of that shit?


He was trying to talk to me. Yes, but I think that would be irresponsible. I think that would be irresponsible. I think that that that young man needs some support right now. And who better to give it than me. Somebody that understands where he come from. When I asked who he was, all y'all had to do, I told all you had to do was say that's one of my sons This nigga, I can't, I can't go to work and kick the back end of anybody that has climbed up the Joe button family tree Joe, you gotta stop Your shit.


You're a fucking rockstar Mel. Don't act that shit on. I'm sorry there's nothing egg on Imani. I'm very accomplished. So when a DDG fans start telling me he invented vlogging, I would give him a round of applause. There's only one problem with that Joe. You can't start and disparage someone and then make it seem like they were wrong for responding back to You. Who said that he was wrong at one point? I nev don't put words in my mouth. Okay, hey gimme iso nigga move you too timid for me right now. Move. Yeah I don't need, I don't need help in this. He's not wrong for responding. I'm never saying that. I sit here and talk mad shit. I expect for people to respond normally. I don't even come come in here with a decency to respond. I don't be one to have conversations with niggas.


I say something and move on. I could have totally ignored this point. He on there talking about let's crosspollinate nigga I'm 44. I do not have time to cross poll. I had to look it up. Yeah. So yeah, I just wanna shout that young man out rather than coming here and kick his back in. That is dope. You Done? You good, You good now? I was good before, I'm never not good at his depart. I live for shit like this. We know before AK had that talk to me. Oh I had it written up. I was coming here to have some fun and he seemed like somebody had fun with Paul but Well one of the things that's destructive, one of the things he said about you was he, he was gonna get you canceled.


I think that's interesting because was cancel culture kind of over? No It kind is. Yeah I don't, I don't see people getting canceled at the clip they were before. Yeah, I I say yes. Guess what? They learned their lesson. My answer is yes. What's your answer? Cancel Culture is over. I think it's over to y'all are Cancel, they get transferred over to cancel culture to timeout culture. Just go take a Timeout. Some, some people, some people can't be canceled. And we were talking about that before we got on the pod. I said like Quincy Jones, he was talking a lot of shit. He said a lot of things but they can't cancel him. He was saying niggas was having sex, he was exposing niggas secrets nigga like big stars shit. He looked up anybody and he did it with a straight face.


I washed his hand. He didn't, he didn't fidget or nothing. Parkinson's didn't hit him that time. I'm not saying he has any, I'm just saying he was, he was, he was focused content and it came from the heart and they can't cancel him. If we, if, if I was to do some shit like that, yo, this person did this, this person did that. He said Marlon Brando was on the rah. Marlon Brando, Marvin Gay Gaye was on the rah. Marvin Gaye Richard. And You know the gays be suing people, the Family. He said Marvin Gaye was bit Like, and that was a question I asked. You said double entendre last Name. Huh? I like that last name. That was a question I asked earlier. Is anybody else besides Quincy Jones Un cancelable. I don't think it's that Quincy Jones is, he wasn't Cancelable.


He can't cancel. come on Canceling goes with relevancy Kid. Cancel Quincy But also legendary status. Whoa. Quincy Some legends kids Quincy's a hundred years old. But. yeah, we've seen Bill Cosby. Yeah, We've seen people get canceled. What I'm telling you, go to cancel. Culture worked so now niggas know better. It is certain niggas is still out here wilding. Okay. And with the Bill Cosbys and stuff, it wasn't that he was canceled. He went to jail. Yeah. Yeah. I wouldn't Say that he was canceled because the show still runs. He's not canceled yet. Not Yeah, He's not canceled. He's not canceled. That's, Yeah. What does cancel look like at this point? Because the only person that I know for sure we can say is at some way the guy that I even, I can't even say Kelly. The guy that made the no on his neck.


Jesse. Jesse Got him on here. This shit was affected. No he that shit was effective. No, he just did. Yeah, he's back some stuff. He actually put out a film himself. He ain't Well that putting out a film yourself To actually speaks To the cancel. I had to do This shit myself. I couldn't go nowhere. So here You go. It was one of the one, one person who I think of automatically, it was a long time ago, but Michael Richards, was that his name? Oh, From, From Feld Kramer. Kramer. Isaiah. What's he doing today? Isaiah, Washington. Isaiah, Isaiah, Washington. Isaiah Washington. Girl that wanted that did the inauguration and they, they canceled Her chrisette. Michelle. Oh yeah, that was a cancellation.


See a Lot of people. Okay, some cancellations we need to take back. Yeah. Chris Sat Michelle, Chris sat Michelle ain't do nothing but a breakfast club interview and, and said And she wore a Basquiat skirt, you know when performed at Trump's inauguration. Yeah. Daniel Caesar. We need to redo that one. I think He, all he did was defend some white ass. He did, he rep foot nodules. But he went out there and yes, Begged For it. Like he, he don't correct the, I'm So sorry. I'm so sorry. All Niggas when war don't correct no op names. I'm, I'm making Listen, I'm so sorry you make, sometimes I sometimes I don't.

But they're saying that we say that we could, they're saying that a power could put enough pressure on you. Yes. To fire. So you have to do something. But if you're employing yourself, Then wait a second, y'all. That's what I just said. That's what they're saying. Wait a second. Hey po somebody gimme that time outta here.

I What's up dog? Do you feel like coming on the podcast helped unca you? No, I took care of that beforehand. Okay, okay. Okay. And then some people still try it. Do you feel like it, it painted you in a different light? Because I was thinking about that like No, I, It was a, I tell what painted me in a different light because one, when I dressed all of that shit, it wasn't because it wasn't a gotcha moment.


It wasn't a reactionary, it was just the fact that I came out and you know, like if you somebody get exposed to something, came out and explained the situation. What about you? You did. So you did rock this weekend, huh? What about Ain't say you. That's true. How about you did so well that it sort of pushed all that shit? Nah, because like they got a new ice Because No. 'cause even before that, like I said, Good dad, RER, He took accountability is what he's saying. And so, and, and you know, optics, people really like when people take accountability without there being an incentive. There you Go. There you go. Yeah. Like it wasn't like shit hit the fan and then, all right, let me address this.


Yeah, gotcha. I Got it wasn't one of them moments. Now it don't come off as, as genuine when that happens. Yeah Nigga, I, I think Joe and Ian will send me packing nigga you, hey come, come here on a, on a on a Sunday. Listen, family day come on a Sunday. If, if it's that detrimental, those Is for the niggas that feel like they can't make another hit. The route that y'all are choosing is for the niggas that got made the one slap caught lightning in the bottle and feel like they can't make it against. So I'm gonna hold onto all things related to this hit bar none whether that be friends, family, whatever. I need this hit. This is the income I make hit time and time and time again.


No we saying if somebody affects business, Joe, if I come up here and say so Then I could go make new business saying with the niggas that I, But the main but the main thing that, the main thing I would, one of us would have if we do something like that, we would have to be removed from the main product. Well no that's facts. But if I, that's not what he saying. What saying? That's what saying He saying. That's what I'm saying. He's saying that that's up to him. That's not, he won't be but The pressure would still apply. He's saying but he not gonna cave to the pressure because he's saying that he gonna get deal the way that y'all gave me XI could go get X from somebody else based on who I am And my You're Losing it off. You losing it off the strength of, of someone else and not What you're doing.


And not just that yo the next company go look up and see what he did exactly And he's still there. This is what, and they saying Yo Don, I don't really wanna work with you either because he still got this Listen, they got, They got rid of Brock Ing nigga, nigga one thing. True. Two things for certain. Yeah. If, if you could provide value, somebody gonna fuck with you. If somebody can make money off you, they gonna fuck with you. I'm shocked that you believe that man, I'm hurt by that. I listen But everybody weighs the put on the scale. That's true. Listen, y'all can't be canceled. Y'all ain't nobody come on. That's not true. Oh, Shit, This shit. This Shit. Damn. Because is that what it really says when you feel like you can be canceled? Is that Oh? Shit? I'm like they might end my run. True. That's funny to me. And I do think that shit's over with It is over with.


Yeah, It is And that's partly for me in my mind. Partly just because of the where the economy stand. No that makes that make sense. They learned niggas but niggas are still whiling. No just maybe not against them. They not whiling to the niggas that have the ability to cancel you. No, I think niggas are still wilding. Niggas are definitely wildling. No whiling. But again they don't face any recourse or any recourse. They Got RJ Hampton right now about to try and get him. Do you think that he gets canceled? He is on video saying whatever he said to his baby mom, she's recording while she got the kid. She went to go see him. He's on there. Hey ain't nobody about to kill you. Whatever he's saying I don't wanna report on it 'cause didn didn't research it. But this is one of those we want to end him.


He did some dv. He said Remove Him from the team. Get get him outta here. So do y'all think that happens for him? I don't. I saw, I've never seen it happen Before. I saw some of the tape. I ain't, again, I ain't really research it and I don't know his history. You know what I'm saying? Like your history plays a part in that. True. Like if if if this was a one off or do you have a history of doing said things, all of those things. I think It's because he a new player. Like do You think it don't mean nothing. Do you think the team is removing him is my question. I don't see them removing him. I see them suspending. That's Usually, and we don't even need to go through this. You see what the Hornets did with with Homeboy? Bridge. Bridge. Bridget go sit down to the side for minute. Yeah come back brought him like It is more time out now. Yeah but listen, this is to the point I just made.


He has value. Is he a good player? Yes. No the kid Bridges is a kid. Bridges has Value. I think in order for you kid be cancelable, you have to have value. You have to Have value. Yeah. No because they could go sit you down if you nobody, they'll get you up outta here. But if you're nobody, it ain't worth them even doing it. If it's nobody you don't even hear about it. If you're a nobody, yeah nobody cares. It's nothing to cancel. There's nothing to cancel, there's nothing. Don't hear nothing about it. It is it's bye. That's it. I think the whole cancel thing before there was a particular community, if you said anything about them you were canceled. Sure. That's not the same anymore. Now that other one, careful tough still both of 'em. Oh yeah. And the, yeah. Careful. Anybody here got Halloween plans? I know I'm a little early.

But no, it's funny This be the signs of someone really experiencing in some crisis shit that I be, I don't, I didn't watch that and think it was funny.


It wasn't. I I thought yo, for a nigga to have to get to that point, you gotta really be going through it. Well, Oh, so oh my God. We've seen the telltale signs of other big stars go on that level where they started doing things that were out of norm. That's right. And then down the line we start looking at shit and be like, they experienced a different side of the industry that we couldn't understand And he, and he is a TV kid. Aw man. That's what you're saying. Right? All I'm saying is when people start doing things to that level, Britney Spears abnormal shit that we just like, why the fuck you doing? I think they really be going through a a point where they don't have no other spit out. So what's, what's the posting of the, of the Solange and all of that?


What is that? I don't know. No, no, no, no, no. That's not good there yet. I want him to stand on this bullshit that he's saying right now. Why you feel his bullshit? Because Drake's real fa friend, fake friend spiel is all over the comeback season. It is all over so far gone. It is all over. Thank me later. It is all over. The whole discography. It is over. Like this has been his story. So for me it was disappointing to see that your song hasn't changed in terms of you feeling like that. It's disappointing to see that you haven't made the changes in your circle. And maybe you can't because that's again, when you just part of too many circles when you're too huge, you're just a part of everything and maybe you can't, but it's a shame that he still feel like that and didn't make the necessary changes to avoid that.


And that's been his story for so many years. Well sometimes your music, that's all your, your music sometimes can contradict what you're actually going through. I think a lot Of people also, I think it's time to question whether he knows how to be a friend or not. Ooh, yeah. Possible too. Okay. That's a difference because That's kind of the point I was making before with a, you could fuck everybody's girl cool when you, that nigga, some of these men hold you higher than that and you have a some relationship equity there. So like him unfollowing me, to me It is very different from him. Unfollowing LeBron and Ain't LeBron's had it on him. Yeah, yeah, yeah he Is. So it's like, don't tell me that that's not a friendship.


And if you keep burning the bridge or seemingly seemingly, 'cause I don't know, then at some point you gotta question the type of friend that you are. That's all. I think I'm very possible. Like you unfollowed DeMar de Rosen and I don't know what happened but I know that these are people, It was in the video. You know what happened? He picked the side. He was in the video. Joe, We about to get hip hoppy. I'm talking about in real friendship, Joe. Wait, Joe, stop man don't I Don, don don't follow me. Still follow my son either. There is a difference. Joe, are you crazy? Fuck outta here. If I was in a video or somebody dis to you, you'd be upset. You've Been in mad videos with Mandy and you've still been my friend. But that's, It's not different. But you, But you spoke to her.


You gave the okay to speak to her because you engaged with her. If you didn't, didn't I give you the okay to do it? Because I don't care. But if I saw that and was sensitive, same with Ish and same with Amma. Any of you niggas that's cool with people I may not be cool with and I unfollowed, You're not enemies. Listen to me. Let me land you. right. Because my point, 'cause my point is didn didn't even forget my fucking point. The nigga that tried to bear spray you nigga. No, no. Wait, wait. The nigga that Tried to bears, wait, wait, wait. If I was in the video with, If Drake, if Drake saw Kendrick in the street, they would talk, I don't know. Gimme a guess. I don't think so. I don't know. I'm good with no gimme a guess. I'm say no I no Called him a, he called him a P word bro. No pussy.


Okay, cool. Maybe not if you see man in the street, maybe y'all talk. So you and Mandy are not out here. Mandy's not trying to end your career. Mandy's not trying to stop the Joe Button podcast from generating revenue. That's a totally different thing than this man That is trying to put you for all intents and purposes under the ground, it's a totally different thing. So if You, I don't remember what I was arguing. So, So I'm I I'll bring you back. So if you are DeMar Rozen and you played in Toronto and me and you have a, let's say a 10 year relationship. 'cause DeMar Rozen was in Toronto for a long, long time. He was right. If you are LeBron James and I got you tatted on me now, now sound like a caper for Drake.


But I got you tatted on me now. Right. So I think that we have a certain level of relationship and a certain level of Rapport and then you go do a Video and now you go being in a nigga's video. That is trying to end me. He might feel a certain type of way He's allowed to to what if he got That relationship with him? I'm just asking then you stay neutral ice. If you beefing with a nigga and you my man and I love you and you beefing with another nigga that I'm is my man and I love one, I'm gonna try to mend the relationship. I'm gonna try to mediate as best as I can. If I seek That is outside of mediation, I'm gonna remove myself, remove myself from that particular situation. I'm not gonna be in the nigga video. I'm not gonna go to, you know what I'm saying? I'm gonna just chill the fuck out. I'm not gonna go to ISIS tour and ice shitting on this nigga that I fuck with and I love and be on the stage.


Like This is what I was literally saying about LeBron showing up to the pop out. Like I was literally saying that and everybody was just like, no, it has nothing to do with that. He plays for the Lakers, this, that, the other, he was there for his wife, blah blah blah. And I was like, mm. That's not the way that Drake That is going to pro. It's not the way that's Drake's gonna process it. I don't know. And evidently it's not how he processed it. It True. And I don't know if any of us up here would process it the same way. I don't know that I wouldn't and I be, I wouldn't, I'd be upset Joe, if a nigga is throwing a concert and the lead to the concert is the fact that he has a song calling you or anything. I can't sit in that crowd.


You are getting unfollowed after that. You wouldn't unfollow me after that. Whether, whether you show the emotion about it, but you at that point would have to say, this person can't be for me. Not saying you have to be for the other person. I'm agreeing with what y'all are saying. That's why I wish I remember what I was arguing. Okay, you was, We was saying that he unfollowed DeMar Dero, he unfollowed LeBron. He unfollowed certain people based on the premise that I'm assuming, I can't speak for him. I don't know him decide. Oh We would, I Would ask About him being life a good friend And not real life. Yeah, yeah. Got it. Y'all are saying That is real life. Got it. Alright, I understand. And also, and you were also making point about him not being a good friend. Yeah. Like I think that's fair too. I think, I think all things are fair here.


But you know what y'all say things like that, right? And it goes back to something we was talking about earlier, which is just respect, especially respect amongst men. True. You know what? Get people to treating you and handling you the way in which you care to be treated and handled. They respect level for you Or, or no you treating and handling them in a way, in a manner in which you want Reciprocated. That's, that was my next point. That comes from the respect level. And again, I just don't think, I don't know, but I'm not sure how many of these industry friendships and relationships he had the most respect for Or, or Right. But I think that every relationship is different. So I think that me and Corey could have one relationship and I might not not have the same relationship with Parks.


You understand what I'm saying? So if, if I treat Corey to a certain standard and I treat Parks to a different standard, I might be soso with Parks. I might be a one with Corey. I might be a hundred with Corey. I don't expect the same recept reciprocity from Parks that I get from Corey. But in this particular situation, there is one action that keeps on coming up. Mm. And That is he will fuck your girl. We are not gonna unpack that again. No, I know, I know. But If I fuck no Bitch. But they, it just leads into the conversation. I fuck Parks girl of you saying girl, and I didn't Fuck Corey girl. Then I, I'm expecting a different level of loyalty from Corey than I got from Parks. What's interesting is the person who's talking about, you know, friendship and feeling alone, et cetera, et cetera.


Wait, If Corey seen you fuck Parks a girl, then that's on Corey and Parks to beef That up. No, it's guys Got it. That's not what I'm saying. I'm joking. I'm saying don't Can see your man doing something that may be dishonorable to somebody he don't really fuck with. He he hasn't done that to you. But how is your man supposed to feel watching you be dishonorable in that manner? I mean, depends. Every person is different. Yeah. Every person is different. Listen That I see one of y'all being extra muddy and I'm sure it's vice versa. I would hope that y'all say something to me or judge the shit outta me. I'm gonna say something to y'all, but we don't have to do that again. Tell me about, tell me about the Solange photo. How do y'all, how do y'all dissect That one? I think it's encrypted. I think it's something encrypted Because it next, it was next to an an Aaliyah photo Too.


It was Aliyah photo. The Aliyah photo. I don't even wanna discuss. Okay. Because he's been a huge fan of, of Aliyah For Aliyah for years. And he could just be posting a picture of Aliyah. I also think it was the anniversary of something. It was the anniversary of something. I don't know when he posted the boat, when he posted that thing. Okay. So I don't want to focus on that. I did not research it. I do not know. Yeah, I know the Solange thing though. I think the Solange photo that he picked is definitely a indication. Like I'm taking a shot at you. I just don't know for what you get what I'm saying. Like I know 'cause it's a million pictures floating around the salon. You don't go pick the picture of her being in the elevator after she just kicked you and smacked you. You know what I'm saying? To represent like, I just don't know what it's for.


We don't necessarily know what's let's, I know he's shooting at him. Let, let's theorize at this point. He's shooting at him Drake, Drake's whole mo. It seems like when he wants to throw his shot or he wants to do something to get at somebody, it relates to him using a woman. He uses some type of image of a woman. How, whether she's connected to you in some type of way and whatever the situation is. He's clearly saying something about Jay. What other reason do you have to use Solange for one and use that photo? That's the, that's a theory. I'm in agreement with that. I Agree. Do y'all think it's wise? No. No. And it's on brand for how he likes to engage and I dont Yet. Why don't you guys think it's wise?


What's, what's, whats the consequence of this? Because you're Ing two when you do that. That's why every time you bring, you mention something with somebody's family, it don't end the best for you. Yo, you playing with the the Big and now you're playing with the big Dog, you're playing with the big dog. No matter what people think pressure, he might be under the little Franklins and fucking with whatever the no family shit Fuck that that too. But you talking if you are, I'm not saying if you are playing with him, you playing with him and you playing with him about something that he's already cleared up in his household. So now you just trying to stir some more old shit up to try to cause some confusion and you know by posting that, even if that's not the meaning behind it, you know the for us go crazy us.


Yeah, That's true. Lemme ask you. He's Smart. Drake is smart. See and that's what I meant pardon him in my DDG rant when I was like, hey I'm cool with the digital warfare but glad to know you not dumb enough to like start take it there Kids. Yeah. To take it a certain, to take it to a certain place. See y'all got me talking about Drake and I said I don wanna talk about Drake Y Yeah but this isn't it. It is important. I get it. Because of who he's shooting at. Yeah. Like I would've came and It is method of shooting. I would've came in and skipped it and Yeah. S lawn, I would've came in and skipped it. I too don't wanna talk about that nigga no more. Not after that unfollow. But he's shooting at Hove. Y'all are saying Hove is the big dog Ish face.


Tell me he's thinking what if Drake feel like he the big dog. Yeah. I keep thinking that we are, we are holding people in a regard that he not holding them in. You just took, took it what you mean? Alright, I get it. Everybody get out his, I don't think that loss makes Drake feel like he's not the big dog. Yeah. I don't think he is still the He is a big dog. Yes he is a big dog. Okay. Can't take that away. But you're coming off of an L. Okay. Major LA. A major L. Yeah. Okay. Whether you want to own it or how, how Better to redeem myself. I hate what you about to make me agree with Ish. How better to redeem myself. And I don't wanna agree With Ish. No, no, no, no. And Broader than that, bigger than That is this goes to, this is redemption. This, this goes to the Jack Dorsey point.


This goes to the Kendrick point. This goes to all the points that are being made. This nigga is hell urban music on his back for the last 15. I don't give a fuck about that. Lemme finish my sentence. Go ahead. Go ahead. Yo. He's held urban music on his back for the last 15 years. You think in his head Jay-Z's bigger than him. You think in his head Kendrick Lamar is better than him. That's why he fucking took Kendrick for granted. Because he's looking at this nigga like a little nigga. He mentioned Taylor Swift, he mentioned Travis, he mentioned all these other people that what he said, what was the Line? So you're speaking to every reason to why he lost I? Yes. 'cause in his mind he is the big Dog and that's why he keeps losing. 'cause you could get the fuck out your own mind, put your ego to the side. We talking about two, We talking about two Different points. No we not. We talking about a nigga first. So we talking a nigga who's smart, he's not dumb, he's not a dumb guy.


This is a dumb move, but Arrogant. So Make you dumb. Keep going. This A dumb move. Keep being arrogant and now you being arrogant with the big dog. The fuck, if you think you a big dog today, the past 15 years, that man is battle tested with not the underling. He's battle tested with the top of the top with the other big dogs. With the other big dogs. And we have, we've had moments where we had to decide who do we think when. Like even with the Jay and Na shit people, there's people who really feel like Jay still caught the better end of that for sure. There's no debate with this nigga. Drake, you lost twice, nigga. Two people who we don't even Herod as high as Jay.


And this is the shit you wanna start the battle with a clip of Solange. All right, let me, let me respond to what, what you and I are saying. Yo, I received that. I get that. And I also feel like he lost to Kendrick. Okay. We all, we All in agreement with that. And I feel like he lost to Pusher. Indeed. I'm not mad at if I'm him saying, okay, I'm losing these creative battles with talent. And to i's point, I'm a big dog. I'm not just talent. I'm now going to start shooting at a page after the Nicki Minaj books. The companies that I think are sabotaging me. Mm. So I'm shooting, I'm no longer shooting at rappers.


I'm shooting at the businessman execs. Yeah. And for as crazy as Nikki has looked in the past doing this, when you look today at Atlantic or when you hear her speak the company that she accuses of building up ops to take her out when that whole building gets wiped out, Nikki's feeling pretty heroic. I felt like there was something strange going on between Hove and Drake when Meg was sending shots at Drake. And I do believe that there's probably a billion reasons for them to have some type of tension. I also don't fall for the features that niggas have done together.


That means absolutely Nothing. It is business historically. That's just business. I I, I do hope that we get a whole album soon. I don't think that Drake is ready for that type of pen. Creatively Hold's gonna be subbing him in 2026. Man Want Soundtrack. Remember now remember Ho Ho was subbing birdman yo that my art Noal cost just as much as youre po Homan. Like he was my boish. He was like, he was so there's been little things to tell you that there's tension there.


I don't know when a whole album is coming And I don't know how crazy he goes on Drake if he even addresses him, but that salon Whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa. It'll be sub, you know got you know him Well you know the UPS box will be on some of the albums. This is gonna be a address. If HOV ever raps, he's gonna respond. Okay, Gotcha. Alright. Hey listen. And I think Drake has every reason to have the, like you said, he has every reason to have. But you Can't tell a nigga that's worth a billion dollars at. You're absolutely Right. 30 something years old that they, not a big, but if Your starting point for all these things women It is women or some shit and you seeing it not pant out the best for you, you should find a new tactic. Yeah. But that's the other thing that I don't love about Drake tactics and what he feels a slight versus not.


I hate that he keep going through it with all of the niggas that are married or engaged have been with this girl for a million years. This woman for a million years. It seemed like I can't, I can't say what it seemed like 'cause I won't. But there's something in that. It's Weird. There's something in there that's like Wale calling me as the lyrical Miracle guy saying, yo man, why I'd love to just be the lyrical Miracle guy. And I'm like nigga, you are the lyrical Miracle guy but you got hits. I'd love to have the hits. It's like the guy that has the world and all the money and all the girls and all The missing that one thing bro. The only thing that you really missing and you empty inside is you did Say that a while ago.


Shit. Bad times. But. Yeah. We're not the first to say this, but I just think as time goes on, small things kind of becoming clearer That money don't matter no more. These girls, not all money don't matter. No more fam, I'm 40, I'm ready to settle down, do some behind the scenes shit and I want to play with my kids and raise a family and be in the house with my wife every day. Yeah. Guess what? You gotta also change some things about yourself to obtain it. I don't know him to say that. I'm just saying I think from the outside looking in everything in the world that the world tells us to shoot for, he's attained it. Minus one thing. But that's a really weird way to start all your beefs. Oh I don't know. Yeah. I'm not speaking to if that's really No I'm not speaking to that. Some subconscious shit. I'm not speaking to that. That's My go to. Well not not, not really.


That's the comfort zone. If if in every one of those beefs, one of my goals has been to tarnish the union with Pusha TI was throwing shit out there in the game to make you fight with your wife with Kendrick. I'm throwing shit in the game to make you fight with your wife. Like it's kind of like I know how bad this feels when you without that. So I want that for you. Mm. Like it's like hater Ish a little bit and it's hater is coming from him who just seems, seems to have everything. And I think if you're trying to beef with Hove then you should do it silently. Nine scenes, 100%. It ain't time for a Instagram post if that's the tree that you wanna bark up Right after a loss and for it don't even like I, that's my problem right there.


Like yo, if I'm shooting that go shoot go shoot. I don't like, I don't like this decrypted Instagram post. Leave it to y'all to interpret. Drake said something. I think he was a message you sent to academics where he was like, we were all wrong about something and everybody just talking. Nobody knows what they talking about. You know how niggas would know if you said something like, I don't like the fact that I do these things. I let y'all speak about it. I'm very cryptic, be direct. I don't clear nothing up and then y'all talk and I just sit back and say, well you're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong nigga say something and say what you mean. That's pop of it again. That's What generation we end though. That's part of it. Yeah, but you just corny now. You don't, you don't get to complain about that.


I know, I know. We fight. You don't get to complain about that. We cut the streams and yada yada yada. And while we theorizing, let me just go down a rabbit hole and put my ten four zero hat on. Oh my favorite part 10 fo Hat. What if Lucian name don't come off of whatever documents he's trying to get 'em off of? Hmm. I think the case goes drastically different. What if knowing that you get your son hired at your competitor, which is the still the craziest thing I've ever heard in life. Yeah. I also heard some other Things. Why do you think that? Why do I think what? Why do you think it's the craziest thing in the world to get your son hired at your competitor?


Not its crazy. It's not crazy for You to do it. It's Crazy for it to happen. Exactly. YES, IT, IS flying shit for you to do it. Yeah. It is also now you control would patent that should not be able to happen. I shouldn't. And when it happens, I was about to say, okay it's it's, it's a sign. It's a sign of something else to come. It's above my pay grade so I can't speak to it. But in the event that all right, I know some shit is coming, I'm gonna get my son hired at my competitor. Well that means that I'm gonna tie up my loose ends And that means that something is about to look different at Universal. And I could tell you how I go when the person that gave you your deal is no longer there. So I don't really, I'm not paying attention to the streaming numbers.


'cause Drake is Drake and he's gonna get all it. It's their job. All artists are dead now I'm just gonna say it. I ain't gonna hold you. You niggas is doing cryptocurrency schemes. You niggas is driving Ubers and Lyfts. You niggas is working in Burger King. I'm gonna come out here and tell you that the state of the music business, podcasting, the economy, if you just look at the different face, you could see where it's hitting at. So the labels ain't trying to, they trying to save every penny. They're not investing in none of y'all. They're not putting music out, they're not improving no budgets. Nothing is shaking for y'all. Y'all gotta go shake ass as stalls now. And Drake is too up for that for me to ever be able to picture that.


But if the support comes outta Universal then how you look at him will continue to, will continue to do that. Yeah. What's this diminish? Yes. I think it's time for him to step away from music for a little bit. I think he wants to if he can. If he can't then I understand Also remember that slick comment that he put out when the Johnny Blaze shit leaked about being a slave to Yes Live Nation. Live Nation is whole Ho has his foot in too many doors for you to do the normal It is Nation Is ho. That's not Jay Got It or he got YES IT.


IS. Oh okay. It is if it ain't It is if it ain't, y'all gonna learn about these powerful people dog. They gonna pick up the phone. I get it there buildings that I can't call right now. I get it. I understand Because the head, head, head, head boss is fly with somebody I ain't fly with. He ain't gotta be part of nothing if he pick up the phone. That make sense? No, I understand. Then this is what It is. That's the nature. This business. That's the entertainment business. That's it. Unfortunately that's, that's why you don't go be in this nigga video over there to make a complete circle. Same shit you ain't fucking with that nigga because that's my man connection. You my man. You don't go over there when Joe button call and ans you don't answer. No. That's that Off.


Yes. See that's us saying that here. I don't know about That. Yes it definitely can I paint a different Picture? That's a good point. Yeah. We all Dunno. I paint a real different picture Today. I don't know's How y All view him. No, I paint a real different picture of how y'all view him. We view him of, we view him the way to view him in music. It's established already. Sure. There's there's nothing to, there's nothing to debate anymore with that. But I don't know Outside of that though, you we talking about Jay-Z we talking about LeBron James We talk the the people that Jack like We talk about the nine figure. Yeah. High building nine. And it's not just that it's circle with power and network. It's the power. Yeah. It is that part 10 figures.


So Drake is him 10 figures. Yeah. Word. So Drake, so Drake is him. We got that part. If we just talking on the podcast, the niggas he's choosing to do it with, I don't feel like they look at him like that at all. Not at all. Not at At all. I just meant from the company standpoint, like you said, a Live Nation HOV makes a call to Live Nation. Well guess what? When Drake goes on tour, that's a lot of money that you, that Drake can forego. Are we gonna really just say nah because ho called I don't know that to be true Today. Let's simplify it out. Do y'all, do y'all think, do y'all think that? Do y'all think today Drake can rap with with Hove Rap with no, Well he's rap with him but you know what I'm saying like in that if they were to engage, No, I don't think so.


I think it'd be pretty good. It would really be a battle. The Olds and the Youngs. I think the olds would be very heavily centric and I think the Youngs would be Like, get this dude outta here. Yes. Lemme say this, I'm not writing that boy off. Put his pen and paper on. I think if D Drake goes in the room and Jay-Z goes in the room and y'all know how I feel about Jay-Z I think Drake could rap with anybody in the world. I just think that Jay-Z is just on an elite level of life and wit and all of those things. So my money is on Jay-Z but I don't think it's just a walk in the park for him. No, hell no. That boy decides that I want to go in the room that Don't think Jay-Z's engaging in the way that we've seen any of these other Battles. And I think that, I think that Kendrick mopping d Drake Drake up has made us forget who this kid is.


Like I think he, I think he played his hand wrong. I think he just, his arrogance just got away from him and made him approach this in a whole different way than he should have. But let's not forget what this boy can do with a penington pad in the paper. Oh no, for sure. That's, I'm not writing him off in the, in the room with Jay. That's what he lose me not doing it. What do you mean? Yeah, I don't feel like that today. I Know, I know. We know. Y'all know that. So I ain't gotta say We know. I will say that I think In that whole battle, the rapping just, if we take all He to me has the best rapping song. Drake. Yes. Gotcha. So I do think he Had and what and Kendrick shit In Yeah. He don't think he'd do well with cerebral niggas. It ain't even so much rapping.


Okay. Like he could probably rap with whoever he wanna rap with if he put, if he put his mind and heart to it. The cerebral dude seem to give him a hard time. I know nobody knows Pusha T but I know him enough. He, he He he's a mental case. Yeah, he's, he's not, he thinks he thinks like a psychopath. He really do Like I'm think no, he's very meticulous in real life. Eminem another one very meticulous. They think different whole very, he's, he's 18 months ahead of what you thinking tomorrow. Some people just are, I try to be like that. I'm thinking that fucking two years from now. Like some he don't seem to do well with Just artsy creative. It's not just creative. Creative. It's artsy Creative. And you know what, if you was gonna shoot a ho, 'cause I'm with a little lyrical, just lyrical competition shit.


Just fuck it if you going I like that about Drake that you know why I stood up to every test. I'd do like that too. That's one of the badges I have on my, I stood up to every test I'm there. So I like that about it. But if you're gonna shoot a ho, shoot a ho, shoot a ho. That's obm. I'm not including Solange. That's what I'm saying. I'm not, I'm not. I just heard Fab the other day tell the story about how he was on the mix tape and he put a bar about Solange and then he got a call and they was highly upset about it. Like, yo did you think about that? And he's like, yo, when you just rapping you don't mixtape shit. You're not thinking Beyonce is about to hear your mixtape. But once they hear it and you think about how it affects them, he went on that whole spiel. I heard that story before. But if they felt like that about that they not taking kindly to you putting, putting the picture of Solange up there from that night.


That night It is probably better. You know I think he knows that though. Night It is probably very traumatic. I think he know that and so, and humiliating. Alright so alright. So get what you asked for then. I'm done. Keep playing. There we go. I'm done playing. I'm done. There we go. Yo. Hey, if you put cheese in the grits, it's gonna be cheese and grit if you put the cheese in the grits Nigga don't be surprised when cheese, grits, gum, the day got end the day got the day got end. That's one of the best quotes of all time in the light in the world. That's one of the best quotes of all Time. It is one of the Best quotes. Shout out to Glow Real. I'm waiting on that classic It is coming. Yes sir. I'm waiting on that classic coming of days Yo. Yeah, I just think all these music niggas is corny down. I ain't gonna lie. I do. I just want the music. I don't really care about all this other shit. Word. Just give me the music and get out my way that Part and let it be fired.


Please. Yeah, that's it. Like I, I, I missed the artist that just put out some fire shit. No antics, no bullshit and just let us get to it. They wasn't rich, they wasn't operating at a high level of business like these niggas are unfortunately tired of it. Bark up that tree. Yeah, she would fall on you. I don't know why if four you please not Jay. She's s not play. I feel bad for Drake. I do. I do. Why you say that? I feel Bad for niggas. I do As I said earlier, Keep walking. Why you 'cause I mean we said it already like, I mean money is great but once everybody got money you gotta put that to the side Dog. Once you start getting older. I don't think it feel good.


You've accomplished all that Shit Yeah man. I don't think it was like that Will Smith quote shit where he was like, yo, once you've bought everything money could buy the money don't mean shit no more. You not happy. Like what is real happiness nigga? Like I'm looking at his face when all them niggas got the OVO black hoodies on. Like He don't wanna stand there. That shit looks a mess my nigga. It looked like I know what that looked like. Been there before. No y'all, y'all remember the picture of Jay-Z after the Michael Jackson shit. It looked like that. It looked like that. You could tell when you could just tell When nigga checked out, I'm about to go do something else my Nigga. Yeah. I don't feel like he don't want to beef with people. He got tattooed on him. I know how he felt about Jay-Z I don't give a fuck with the end. Yeah, what you saying? That's true.


I know how you feel about Jay-Z That's true. And I mean, again, I've been saying this for mom don, nobody want, listen, if that's happening with Jay-Z then I'm imagining what's going on with Wayne. I don't think that they great. Oh, I could imagine it. I Ain't so it's like thought that, I don't think that feels good. I just don't think he feels good. You're on an island by yourself Committ And You Dunno how to fix. And you also don't know how to fix it because you're resorting to like old tactics that don't work At all. And all the people speaking for you is just goofy. Like you got homeboy coming home sounding and something don started. You try to fight for respect and the niggas that you want to respect from don't respect you. It hits a little bit different.


you know what I mean And you gotta, you gotta, And then you realize, and then to him it's like you wasn't involved. You wasn't involved, but you realize that you niggas really in his mind, you niggas really never fucked with me in the first place. You, I feel you You know what I mean. Yeah. I feel used. Like you niggas never fucked with me. I thought you, you just was using me 'cause I was hot. It Wasn't the industry In general. You Know what I mean, which is why I said when you watch him do that on stage that don't look funny to me. I I Agree with you. That really, Like I've been saying it's, I've been saying And whether he Doing this fake love, We not talking about It is one thing to put it in a song's e to stand on a stage. But he's probably known that these niggas really don't fuck with me for Years.


He don't look like he's Feeling great. That's all these niggas don't fuck with me. They haven't fuck with me in a while. And I think after a minute after maybe the first 7, 8, 9, 10 years, he realized, yo, you don't really fuck with me Dog. Yeah. Real quick, you, you hear stories about people being in business, relationship with others and then when, when the person that's up leave how the person who's not as up fall down from Grace. Right? You see the different stories. But imagine, you know this nigga who's considered up or where he's at. Nobody fucking with him. I know y'all said this before, but just imagine like, it's like all the cer all the walls are closing in on you. Mm. You Know what I mean. Let's say, let's say We can close after that. You The nerd dude, right? So you've been longing to be friends with people.


He's admitted that on camera. Like, yo, when I was coming up rapping, I wanted to sound like Joe Button. So now I meet Joe Button, I'm saying, yo my nigga, it's an honor to meet you. Idols become rivals. I'm cool with you, I fuck with you, whatever the case may be. So he felt like that about you I'm sure he felt like that about a, a multitude of other rappers. Right. Now, finally, I get to meet y'all. I'm working with y'all. I'm thinking y'all my friends and y'all not really my friends. That gotta feel some sort of way, my nigga, I've been, I've been invited to the cool table and y'all niggas really don't fuck with you. Me, y'all look at me like a asset and y'all using me to make hits, but then behind closed doors, y'all calling me a nerd, or y'all calling me a fuck boy or y'all calling me a bunch of other things. White boy, boy, like dog.


Y'all don't really fuck with me. Like Kendrick made him look Canadian to me. I know it sounds funny, but I'm not trying to made Him like a corner. No, I understand what you're saying. Sure. Made him look like a foreigner. He made Him look like he's not of this culture. Boy. Yeah. Outsider. And even cosplay. Even, even when he is doing the rant, like I'm listening to his voice doing the rant versus his voice on the Johnny Blaze tapes versus his voice over here. It's like, damn it. Yo, I feel bad for some of the niggas. I feel like this just can't beat theirself. Which is what yo who even Are you Today? Hold on. Bottom line, yo. Drake, get the fuck away from This. shit. Word. All I, I'm, I'm not saying talk about, I'm not saying, I'm not saying don't continue to try to build on business.


I don't know if you are a good guy or a bad guy, but you sound like and seem like someone That is going to be broke by this industry. Yeah. In the worst ways. A a if He's broken by or broken by, we're not broke moneywise. And it'd be sad to see that again. We saw it with Mike, we saw with other people. I think he's headed towards that way in the industry. Then the other way of the Jays who figured out how to stay at the top also play the game the right way and not have to have these That's that go. Can we compare it to Mike? I don't. I I, I see, See it. I don't think his constituents turned on him. Mike. I see it talking about the Yeah. 100% he turned against him. One 1%.


But he died along by choice. Ish, I'm talking how Do We know? No, no, no, no, no. We don't know That. No. How do we Know that? We don't know that. Not So, okay. I get what you're saying. What I'm saying is that I don't, I didn't see anybody saying they don't fuck with Michael Jackson, but Oprah and them still fuck with 'em people that he No, No, no. If you interview, If you do, if you do enough research, you will find that he kept himself a sec at a certain point. 'cause he couldn't trust anyone. But That's himself too. Okay. Because of the Things He's experiencing. See, it wasn't the internet generation. So we used to get all our information from the news and shit like that. Yeah. From people. So when reports start coming out about him and the kids and all that shit, motherfuckers I'm sure was turning they back on him. Okay. Okay. You know what I'm saying? I'm sure niggas was turning they back on him, so I Got it.


Yeah. This That Is just fucked up. That's other reason. That's the, i I agree with everything you're saying about dude fulfillment is just priceless. Yep. And we think it come from fulfillment, looking from other people. So many different things. Looking from other, looking For it from other people as crazy. You feel bad for real? I do. Yeah. You feel bad. No. You feel bad Or is that I've Had, I've had, I'm sorry. These feelings about homeboy since way before you even made that mean post, that's why I feel like niggas that don't have the fulfillment, you can't even make that post about niggas that, that are fulfilled It. is it feel bad or I I I saw this coming 'cause you, you, you, you can see a lot of things. So is it like, I feel bad or I saw this coming and I didn't see this coming.


Granted what goes up must come down. But I didn't, didn didn't, I didn't not like see this. I didn't see this coming. Okay. Okay. I, I want people to feel good about themselves. I want people to, you know, especially when you in entertainment to where it's like, you know, they say three weeks in real life is an hour on the internet. Like I feel like that about entertainment. Like if you 40 in entertainment years, then you might be 70, 75 years old. Just in what you've seen, what you've experienced, what you've accomplished, what you've done, what you've made versus what you like. But without the salacious shit. So let's just, can't you understand like without the salacious shit attached to it, you have shown respect.


I remember when he sent you a DM and you didn't want to read it on air. You like, I'm not gonna read this part. I'm not gonna read this part. So you had love and I remember some of the stuff when he was acting a certain way, I could see it in your body language that he was like, are you supposed to be cool or we cool? Are you doing this to me? That's my opinion. I'm not saying that's how you felt. I'm just saying my observation. So can you understand when a nigga fuck with somebody and they don't really fuck with him? I'm saying putting yourself in that position where you like, yo, I show this nigga love. Yo he cool and then you, you going on the internet acting like you don't really fuck with me. If you understand what I mean. They Both have that argument though, huh? They can both have that argument. Got it. 'cause 'cause He, he can say Joe ain't really fuck with him. He Can say he's experienced things where he expected him to hold him to a certain respect and he didn't.


So they can both have that argument. I didn. I came at the later end. I didn't see that when I was here. He was showing that nigga love to me. Yeah. When I saw it initially. But You know, instances can be, but when we start looking at his experience, he start the Kanye shit, all of it. You start watching people get into this industry, reach a certain point. Yeah. And then certain things just happen where you feel like, yo, something, something's gonna go either really great here or it's gonna go really bad and not talking about the business, just you as a person. It's starting to look like that. And Am I, am I, and and, and this is the last word for me, Joe. I don't want to drag this on. Sometimes I feel like I'm outta tune because when somebody's spiraling outta control, if I fuck with them and I stood on this hill, I don't believe in joining the public against them.


Right. That's not me. I, I'll go down with them with the shit going down and that, that may be me being blinded. So sometimes when I hear these things, it looks like when these guys are speaking about things, it's like you accept society or you understand when you fuck up, nigga, we ain't fucking with you no more. If you do some fucked up shit. I'm distancing myself. It seems like people are more comfortable with taking that route instead of the loyal route or, or maybe not be loyal When you've been the guy for 15 plus like it said, and you've had everyone champion your music. And in the moments where we thought people were gonna shit on you, people still showed up. And now there's a moment where it seems like everyone is on the other side of the fence. Not just the the the general listener but also the industry that does a lot to your brain to figure out what do I do at this point?


Got it. How do I just create, how do I even create now? 'cause I don't even know how I can create on some normal shit. And on top of that, I gotta fight with the big wigs as a artist. He's still just like, don't get me wrong, he is business Got it, but to them he's still just an artist. You can't play with us. Yeah, that's true. So we will show, don't get me wrong, Michael was the top of the top. But we will show you nigga that you just an artist, you're a nigga. Even with the control that he had, nigga Mike owned half of niggas publishing. True. And because we want that asset back, nigga. We'll do whatever we can do to get rid of you. Yep. Drake is in the same position in my brain. I agree. I agree with that. We feel like you are at a point where either you getting too powerful or you control too much and it's time to shut This shit down.


We'll lose 400 million today so that down the line we can control 2 billion Got. it. That's what it seems like to me. Yeah, I I agree with you a hundred percent. I'm Yep. That's, that's exactly what it looks like. Like I'm trying to make a move off to be a boss over here and they saying you are a threat. No sir. I, I don't think, I don't even think they let this go that far. If they ain't filled some a certain type of way about what He's doing. Listen, as wild as 2024 has been, if you want my prediction, I anticipate 2025 strap up 10 X-ing it, strap up Jesus. It's gonna be a good season. I feel like I've said that before. The Drake ho salon shit is more of the same for me. Falls in a bunch of Oh, y'all getting ready to turn it up.


Up. Yeah. And some of y'all trust y'all selves too much. Niggas got trust issues with everybody but themselves. Niggas are here betting on themselves. That's the problem. You said that's the problem. You said they trust themselves too Much. You trust yourself too much. Niggas trust themselves enough to believe that when they want to crash out, it's the right decision, y'all. I want to crash out right now and I trust myself to do that. To Come out. To come out Of it. Yeah. To yeah. Come out on cave. I trust myself enough to believe that I'm the king of the castle and ain't nobody fucking with me. Get the fuck outta my way. I'm smelling my shit. My shit smell good. But you but you Was always trust myself. But but we but that was instilled in us though in life.


That's Not true to yourself. Trust. Did that shit work for you a couple times? What you mean that's not true in believe it, that's not True. No. The same way I might not trust one of y'all the same way. I might not trust myself. Yeah. I've seen, I've been with myself enough times to see me be chaotic in enough situations, to be rebellious, to make the wrong decision to snuff a nigga. You shouldn't have snuff to fucking stalk a girl. You shouldn't have stalked. I've seen me in all my worst moments. Mm. So I might need to run this by people I trust And that But Joe, what happens when You don't trust nobody? No, Not just that. When they, these moment. Well no, you've been in these moments and it worked out for you. It ain't really be as bad as you thought it was. Oh, then you're not, so now you're sitting here like, hey I could count on myself because it Works out for me.


Then you're not as humble as you need to be. And there's two people on earth, the people that are humble and the people that are about to be. So if you feel, if you feel like that, then you, then you don't know that it only take one. It only take one. It's Pat Mahomes versus the field. It's Mike Jordan versus the field. It's LeBron versus it only take one instance for all of that shit to come crumbling down. We Watching it Unfortunately. And I don't want to, We not just watching it with him. I don't want to, he's watching It with because I love Drake's music. Mad niggas old music. Maybe not the new shit, but it's played too much of a, a instrumental part in your life. In my 20, in my thirties. So it's like, and that shit come on, it'd be fire.


It's like where Is Him? I hate to see people not talking about him now, but just come in this industry and seemingly lose themselves. Yeah. But a couple That is the worst. Been a couple of, that's the worst loss you could take is losing you. And that's for you to decide who you are, who you want to be, who you will be, who you was. That's on y'all. That might be part of the trick of the industry convincing us that they lost themselves. It put you in such a great position that you end up losing yourself. We see a lot of people go mad with, with with great, with great power. Drake in spite of me rooting for Kendrick, nigga, I don't, I don't, I don't wish you any ill will. And I do hope that you feel better if you are feeling down. Same to DDG saying to anybody else who might think I'm on some oppy shit on, on just being mature.


I don't want This shit to get to better or none of y'all as someone. I'm saying that as someone's gotten the better off Honestly. Yeah. In the past. Not now. I beat that shit. I beat my demon nigga. I forgot I caught the raw. I forgot. Oh my God. They send me some paper. I Was like, Oh Shit. You copped it. Yeah, I Got it man. You are a bird. Yo. Where is that?

Snoop Dogg is the one that told you that there was an opportunity to be serenaded at October London Show. He asked me if I would allow for that to happen Because October London has signed the death row.


Yes. Which is Snoop. Yes. Yes. And Mel's Like, you know what man? Oh, I just don't know what the way I've been sleeping lately. I've got a little crick in my neck and my, my back isn't feeling the greatest. I dunno what to wear. You know? I don't wanna gain like the reputation of being that girl that just goes to the shows and the hot r and b guy that all the girls want. It is just discerning and singing tune. So I mean I did that for Lucky Day, I think Rock October, London. I'm gonna take a little break because I've been on a tear recently. Tear. I've been on a tear. Actually A tear recently. What? What do you think? And I was like, Nah. Yeah, that ass, that that sounds smart. Like you don't want just be the girl on stage at every show.

Hey My mom text me to same. Your Mom's too. Yeah. My homeboy that was there sent me a video. Same Thing. So clearly I'd say Melyssa Ford changed her mind from the morning when we spoke. You don't think that that request coming down the pipeline was a request to not be ignored? I wasn't thinking you should ignore it. I was thinking you should say how you felt. So you didn't feel like doing that. You know, honestly, I really actually liked how it was done.


Got it. I liked how it was done so, and I was the little parent. I was like, oh, is it gonna be the stool situation? No, they had, it looked like a cigar lounge and so there was a couch there. And so I was like, oh okay, so I'm just gonna sit on the couch. A couch. Yeah, a couch on the stage. Alright. Yeah. And then you know his bass player's right there. And I'm smoking a cigar and drinking a drink and I liked it. It was cute. And October was amazing. Okay. Yeah, that's what's Up. Well I'm sure you were just as amazing. Shout out Toto London. Jasmine Sullivan. Maxwell. Jasmine Sullivan was amazing. And you know what? Maxwell was talking a lot about Embryo, you know, Thank you for sticking with me.


Like the fans Embryo is literally like one of my favorite Maxwell albums. Hey, when niggas don't know their best slaps, I love that album. Niggas don't be knowing their best slap. That Might be the best album. I wouldn't be thinking nobody for sticking through me while I made some of my Best Heat. Every Years Is the one. Yeah, But I get what he's saying though, because That is, He's saying they around, they've been around since Embryo. Oh, that ain't what I take that as. No, he was saying like, yo, for, for those of you that know this, you know what I'm saying? Like, they just riding with me this snow. Oh No, no, no, no, no. It was about Embryo being like he, he received a lot of criticism for that album when it first came out because people were just like, it was such a far cry from his debut album.


It was more cerebral. And then it's one of those albums that like, it stands the test of time and it just gets better and better and better. I loved it from the second I fucking heard it. That embryo is different. I like knowing that we have a guy of that legacy. Yes. Performing and then having a guy who's now just coming up super dope, being able to open up for him. I think that's Fire. Yes. And Backstage there was like, you know, Maxwell was just so grateful that Wait, You was backstage. Hold on. Yeah. Why you can't never, she was a performer. Why you can't never just go to a show like Safari. Yeah. Like why are you backstage mingling, rubbing your little ashy elbow on that?


I mean, I'm saying hi folks. Yeah, but October London was in Maxwell's room. No, he Or he was in his room. He Was in his, I did you see Maxwell? He was in his own room and then we all walked down the hallway to go see Maxwell. Oh. And I went to go see Maxwell's manager, John d, Jill Scott, John D who I've known for a really long time as well.

Yo. Lemme get the canal LOEs the strawberries. We want Cokehead and Some lines. You Know what I mean. Shout to LeBron. Now that you got all the photo ops, they can send that nigga to the G League.


I'm not on the side of that. I'm saying that because some of the basketball minds think that that should happen. There's nothing To roll with it. I'm not, I'm getting that photo op 41 times. Oh oh not 40. I'm 41 times on the Laker on the home court game. 41. I think he will get sent down or he'll get sent down. Sent down. Wait What he's getting sent down. He's definitely get sent down, bro. Back up. I don't think So. I would take some pictures first. I think this is Mark. That Whole bro bronze shit is the best marketing shit in the world. That's dope. So why would we send him down even though basketball wise we should send him down. But other than that, I think the market, this is bigger than basketball. Beat That. This ain't about Basketball. You want that picture? You wanna see LeBron do the baby powder in the air with his son next to him doing that.


Imagine LeBron throw bro a alive. Oh that's gonna happen. You want these things to happen. So You don't think he's gonna be sent down? Do you think he's I don't, I think it's too much market in here. He's definitely being sent down. I don't think he's being sent down only because I read a story that says LeBron James has hired a DJ for before practice and after practice. And then I remember that he also started a podcast with the head coach and I'm like, oh we in the era of LeBron can do what the fuck he wants to do. He just did it. His, his son drafted draft a $8 million deal. The warrior said they was thinking about drafting him but they wanted to respect LeBron. So I'm with all of this.


If Lucian Grange could get his son over there, I motherfuck a thousand percent. And that picture is some of the hardest shit I've Seen. That's dope. Dope. And I do wanna say he does look like a good defensive player from what I've seen. He looks like he could be a really good defensive player. So I don't want to just go put everything on Bro. And they pointed like they pointed it out on the internet. How well bro walked down this to look back. Sure. The camera got the shot. All, all right. Now I could go, you know what he doing? Yeah. This is big business at play. Me, me and Trey took in the studio when I was rapping and shit, but I ain't LeBron's and nobody gave a fuck about that. But as a dad you do feel good when your son is doing something.


Oh, you're a prick layer too. It's like aw. Aw. Kendrick and Rihanna. It is announced that they have turned down, Coachella turned down the opportunity to headline Coachella. I absolutely love this move so much. I hit the round of applause. What do y'all think about that? Why do you like the move? Why do I like the move? Yeah. Because I'm with not continuing to lease our superpowers to people. Agreed. One two, Kendrick is doing the Super Bowl and then the tour. And the tour right after that. Yeah. And the tour after that I, I heard and heard and His room with That is doing the stadium tour after that. Yeah. Coachella is a two weekend event.


So you're not paying me 2, 3, 4, 5 million for one week and you're paying me that for two weekends. Not coming off the Super Bowl. Okay. That's Kendrick. What about Rihanna? Rihanna is Rihanna. Yeah. I'm not coming out. My name is Rihanna. I'm, I'm selling draws and I'm had a, I'm having another kid or had another kid I'm in love with asap. My catalog is still killing. I'm Rihanna.

And I don't like how, I don't like how fast Coachella be replacing niggas when they have a problem too. You have to though like something. I understand but how they do it when they, what was that, that time where they put the weekend Kanye instead of Kanye. Kanye. Right. But that was on him. What the fuck Were they supposed to do? I don't care. You Tried to bomb This shit in the, in the 24th hour. 23rd Hour. That's not Kanye's story. Kanye's story is, yo stop, stop boycotting Travis Scott. That's my man. If he can't perform, I'm not performing. That's not trying to bomb. That's repping for your people. Whenever that decision was made, it appeared when that story broke that it was late and they had to get a replacement contract.
