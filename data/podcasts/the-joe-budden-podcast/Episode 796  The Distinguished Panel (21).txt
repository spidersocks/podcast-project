It's a, a synth masterpiece for my synth nerds out there. Mike Dean went absolutely crazy. Mike Dean and Metro Woman also should just produce everything because the records they did together on this and on Future's last couple albums are fucking incredible.


And some of the Kanye shit, I love the shit. The second half to me, I don't know. It kind of dragged, but I also listen to it in the morning. It's not the same. I listen to the first half on Edibles at midnight. Mm, That's perfect. Yeah. It hits a little different than Driving in the morning, You know what I mean? I, but I Love it. It is the first weekend project I loved on first. Listen, since that EP he dropped however long ago, My Dear Melancholy. Yeah, I think that's what it was. My first, from Track one, I was like, this sounds dark For sure. And I love Dark Weekend. Yeah. Like it still had that eighties synth sound too.


Like we just heard. Yeah. Yeah. But it wasn't Poppy Facts So I was like, Oh yeah, I'm locked in already. I'm good. I didn't get as far as you did because it was late. Yeah, yeah. Kids and that shit. But yeah, I just took away that okay, if We on some dark sounding shit that is super synth up. You got me And I like, I like weekend's development in terms of melody writing, they seemed a lot more interesting. And I don't know if that's a result of being in the studio with Mike Dean, who's a fucking super musical fucking, he's created all these melodies on the keyboard so maybe they're bouncing off each other. But for a while I feel like can got into a, a flow that was like that rap r and b flow where you're just doing a simple ass melody. Repetitive, it was super repetitive and this is not that.


Yeah. I'm, I'm looking forward to Really making with this, this enjoyed the first half of this project, but to me it took off at Track nine. Now when that, that future Travis Scott and the ones right around that Track nine was Reflections. Laughing. I'll play little bit of that. Like we've already said the production on this shit. Yeah, It is a Travis record. This one. Yeah. Crazy. Do we still love the trend of them not listing features on projects? I hate it. I appreciated when Elliot uploaded the track list with the features.


I hate that shit. I did that shit. Yeah. Let me know who's on the fucking song. Yeah. Even though I'm gonna take 'em off on, on the title, but I wanna see. Yeah that's all The credits are easy enough to read on Apple, so, or Spotify. A lot of the places the credits are easy to read. So I think you have to, title's a little different. You can just go in and look. Right. Reflections laughing. Track nine Being stupid. Yeah. I gotta go out tonight. This Sound like weekend. You gotta head it outside. This Is a road trip album for me. This sound like old weekend, old house of balloons Ish. Yeah. Let's not get crazy. Yeah, No, I'm just, Let's not get crazy.


Not saying let's, let's not get too crazy now. I see what you say. The dark darkness of It is. That's scent Of Yeah, that's what I'm saying. The first, Yeah, there was a little two album phase where he was just a little too popped out. Yeah, Yeah. For sure. It was too much. There's a color record that Star Boy era when he was Yeah, I'm a motherfucking star. You know, I like some of them joints on there, but some Of the songs is cool. But overall, Yeah, he he back in his dark bath. Yep. Oh my Lord.


This music is just, yeah, this production mixing, mastering. It just sounds Expensive. Very, Very. But it sounds good. Absolutely. I'm trying to find a song. Luxurious. That's That's what It Is crazy too. This is 10, I'm telling you from nine. Absolutely took off record. I think I'm in God damn Future Went Crazy too.


Future went crazy too. We got singing RB future. Yeah. That be stupid. Yeah. Yeah. This is definitely, it's Fire Man. Jump on the road. It's fire. I ain't gonna sit here and and bleed y'all to death. I'm looking for a certain Song. Where the fuck is that song? Is this the song? Let see. Ooh. Oh Yes. Oh my God. Nah, nah, nah. Cock this back, cock that back. Cock that back.


That's the one. Just when you thought you just, when you thought you had a peg? Nah, this is West Side Highway. Late night in a Beamer. You love a Beamer or GWA second date. You already gave her 95 hours on the phones. You already talked her ear. If she know everything about you now you're just taking a little ride right quick on the late night to the mailbox at the hoodie store. Let's go. Oh my God. He's fucking, do we have production credits on this shit yet?


Almost all Mike Dean And we Can, justice is on there a couple times. I wish I was still doing music so I could pay Mike Dean to sit next to me while I do music. Let him go, let him go him Cook. We just enemies Not forget Metro.


Metro did a too Metro did a bo too. I forgot to He's showing out. Yeah, he's showing out. That's How you close out man. As, as as great as the first half was nine on down.

Since It is legit. I be legit. I hate all you fans that are stalking people's tours to see if they sold out and how many seats they sold.


I think y'all are annoying. It's weird. And And it's stupid because I don't, I really don't think y'all know how big a stadium is. Yeah. Like you expect somebody to announce a tour today and the stadium tour sell out in a week. Wait, They're already clocking his shit. Well they were clocking Kendrick and Scissor shit from the minute they Dropped. Oh yeah. And they doing it with Drake and Australia. They just do it now.

I Feel like we're gonna to re-put the tag at the beginning before we get to that section. Mm Yeah. Might have to Nuts. Yeah. Wild King Nights. That shit was way better than the freak offs. Oh Man, It is. Are we here now? I mean No. You sure? We can't be here. All music SG Yeah. Come on. Oh Yeah, yeah. Est G dropped his album. I ain't Feeling You My first Listen It is short.


12 songs, 30, 33 minutes, something Like that. It is even shorter than that. Once you roll the window down, I, it took me a minute to find something that I'm I'm, and if you got Power Window, all you gotta do is Automatic. Nah, get back. Alright. I ain't saying nothing. I'm up. So Ice could give. I was really, listen, there's A whole generation of people that will not get that reference at all. Yeah, That's A I what you was talking about the That nasty. That's a CD Joke. That Is true. Because what do you do now when there's nothing to do? Delete it. Yeah. But dad don't have the same effects. What?


No, what they do now is they make what they've been doing for a while, they make the meme of like somebody slam dunking and shit into the trash can. That's the, that ain made the internet version. It is not the same. Not first Frisbee, Frisbee somebody shit Fla the phone down Fri weed Play or making a coaster. Yeah. Yeah. Frisbee and the weed play we won. Yeah. But go ahead. I y'all have been waiting for this album for a minute and my first listen, it was too polished. And I know that sounds like a crazy critique to have, but when you have somebody that makes gritty street music, this shit just sounded too clean. I'm listening to songs, I'm like, all right.


It's just not hitting the same as his earlier music has been. It wasn't until I got to about track five maybe when I'm like, okay, now we back now Do you think that's like a sonic thing or like content wise? It's, it's a combination of both. Got it. It's a few things. Yeah. When, when I played the first track off the shit, and this is just off the sample, I did not purchase it. His voice was different. Oh his, his voice don't even sound like it sounded when he was on his run. Like, it sound like fucking sick Ish. It's, it's, it sound like that telephone like he's rapping through a, a telephone like the prison raps when a niggas do. Yes. That's, That's what it's been sound. But that's been a thing for a minute now with him. Where my fucking, why Yeah. I could play it Joe, I don't know.


I do not know the reason behind it. But you, there has been a moment where you could hear this, the change in his voice and it almost sound like he's before this album, it was sounded like he was mumbling through a phone. Oh, ITTA Girls? No, this is just track one drum on it Blowing Money. But I wasn't with Big Meat. I with we had 50 on us some play. Okay. I can't, I Can't hear his voice a his voice like That, that one get a couple out. You, it might get a couple dollars outta me, but in like by, by the time I got to about five or so, soon as I heard that forever rolling, we were back.


Okay. So I don't know if it's maybe him trying to expand his sound, him trying to, I I I can't pinpoint it. It just didn't really do it for, for me. Interesting. It didn't do it For me. It Didn't do it for me. Now there, there are a few flips that he did that I was like, okay great. I love this flip. I, the the duffle bag boy flip, which I believe I played the sleeper when it first dropped. That one was cool. I don't know man. I'm just, I I immediately cut this Off. Expectation expectations might have been too high. No, because I didn't like his previous pro projects. I, I ran right back to bigger than Life of Death.


And I don't like when I do that, when I listen to your album and it needs me feeling so underwhelmed that it's like, you know what, let me just go back to what did it for me. Pause. Right. So I, I feel like he should have been more aware of the fizzle out or the wind down to do this. Yeah. I don't know. I feel like there's something's missing. This is Something you just dropped when you all the way on fire. Don't have a care in the world and just wanna give your fans something to hold, hold 'em over until my real shit comes. This don't sound like the the real shit. The Shit you've been waiting, working on for Years. It might, it it might not be the real shit. But How long do you have the luxury to, to play like that right now?


How long In between the two projects was there like his, this album, last album? I have to check. But it, It is been a minute since we got a project from him. Maybe maybe two. When, when, when maybe when were you satisfied with his music? How long ago Joe? Like what was the last project that you said your SCG gets some, some heat A few years ago. Two years. Two years. The last, Last one got it when I came on the pod and said, oh my God, What are y'all gonna do with this boy for the next 10 years? I get hyped too fast. I get hyped too fast. Somebody come out, come out the gate smoking for a few years. I automatically pinned them. The king for the next 10. I gotta stop. I gotta stop doing that. This shit is too fickle.


Fans will love you one minute, hate you the next minute. It's too many variables. I gotta stop. It's, It's, it's unfair to a lot of artists. 'cause as fans one hand will say we want you to, you know, expand your sound, grow, et cetera. Right. And then when you take that or experiment something and it don't work, people will start complaining that we, 'cause we want your old shit. Mm. So it's like you damn near gotta be perfect. Even if you got them two or three new ones in. Yeah. You gotta give 'em eight. You gotta give 'em two. Yeah. And if they hit, then they hit you. It work. You can now expound on that. But if it don't hit, then you can shy away from it.


Especially in this era where you can just do singles and digital releases and shit. You could test shit out. See if that works. Okay. People ain't really rocking with this. Let me just give 'em some ESTG share, whoever we're using this an example. Anybody. Yeah. Let, Let me get my wheelhouse and do that. It, I don't think you need to play the game anymore where you just drop an experimental album. Mm, No. No. You can tease shit. Not shit. Not even experimental. It's just like, Experimental is the wrong word, but expanding album. Yes. Yes. That's what It is. It's like, 'cause on one hand I do want my artists to expand. Right. I don't want you to stay the same person over and over and over. True. And over. And then we have artists that stay the same person over and we Love It Over and over and we love them.


Yeah. Future. So e Exactly. So it's like, it's, It is really unfair to them because you, like, if you're a artist, it's like, all right, how do I do this? Do y'all want me to fucking keep making the same song over and over and over and over? You're gonna kill me for it unless it's all hits. But that's where your real artistry comes in. Yeah. Because you're not making albums for the people necessarily. You making albums for what makes you feel good. Well there's a, a lot of people that are not really artists. That's true. Oh sure. I'm just saying that's, that's The whole Is Drake, is Drake the only one that could switch it up and be successful? Kanye West, Kanye West of course. But I mean to have the longevity. Kanye West has been doing it for 20 years. Shit. The weekend. The weekend.


Hmm. People do it. It's just sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't work. I know what you're talking about. Wouldn't Kanye be more on the production level of Switcher the Artist with that sound? Yeah, his whole, he went from basically rap rap shit to rap. Rap in the eight oh eights. Yeah. Than Switching techno shit with then to gospel shit. Like he has constantly evolved and changed his sound. Got it. Successfully. We It is. Alright we got it covered. Don't do that again. Yo. What the Fuck? So when they say Kanye West is A producer, yo No, no, no. I got it. I got, I gotta ask a question. Don't do that Joe. Is is Hawaiian punch from Hawaii?


Hawaii? Yeah I know. Is It, is it Punch for real y'all damn. So yeah I never heard that. Is Hawaiian Punch really from Hawaii. That's Fucking trying to make fun of his man's questions. That's no We've unpacked the flip questions while you've been going. Yeah We miss you yo. Yeah man we really did. Yo, normally when somebody take a week off the Pod they come and fire you. I think that they about to come back and smoke shit. Go crazy. Well come on Wheels. You Been podding for 30 minutes. Mm I mean even knowing that yo how you been? How was your wheel? That is good. What else is supposed to do? Nigga's 70 years old getting covid nigga he just survived. He's happy to be here.

That's what he said. Black people always hear shit different from what somebody say. He said this ain't hiphop. Hip hop is black music. Yes, but he didn't say that. So when you say this ain't hip hop, keep me out of that category please. I don't wanna find his tweeter. Got him. Exactly. I don. But that's what he said. That's his way of saying what they be saying. Which is, yo, I'm white doing this. Y'all are mislabeling me. Don't don't put me in a box. Yeah don't put me in a box. I do it broader than the   Oh ERS?

I've never said that. That's Ever, that's that's peaceful me. That's Yes, that's ultra.


I Believe you. That's Sonic peace. That's the biggest piece. That's Nah, that peace. That's PeaceCorp. That's On gas. That's red call. That was fucking I Believe you. That was in my craw. That's super. I Believe you. That shit was just sitting in my C craw and I could not, I could not. I don't think you ever said that. Your C craw. C craw. Like honestly Yes. That's not even in your dm. What's Craw ma'am? Just Gullets. That's not even in your, oh, you wouldn't do that. I ain't gonna lie, son. They, they, yo they they, it was Like food got stuck. They took the picture and posted it on the internet and said, you know when we take pictures outside, they said we can tell this is post shit. She's sitting there looking dumb as hell in the face.


You look crazy. That's she caught a temper tantrum. I didn't No, I know You're not motherfucking talking about 10 tan, 10 Tans. You gave me credit other day. But that's Why I'm bad at beefing with, with women. 'cause they just get the extra shit now. She got a face in the picture. Face on the Face. And look at Joe, Joe, Joe Leaning face in the room. I'm thinking like Joe Leaning the the other way trying to stand firm. Yeah. She's trying to not have her leg touch my girl. Chill ass outta here. She was crazy. I Stand, I stand in my opinion of it, but I never wanna hurt my girl Mel's feelings. Yeah. So I'm with you. Thank you. I'm with you. Fuck with ice. Yo Also Who, but I do think that It is your time. Like it's yours.


So like I can't waste it. It's it's yours. It's like self-esteem. That shit is in you. Like it's your time. If I come to you and, and spin you around the block with Mad Lies. Yeah. I'm not fucking my baby moms. Oh yeah. I'm trying to get mad. I'm not trying to get married one day. Yeah. Ain ain't got no other bitches. If I come to you with this just gauntlet of lies, it's on your job, but It is your job. So hold on. So To shift through 'em. So, okay. I can't tell you how many times a guy will say to a woman like, let's go what you do Ayo, do whatever's happened to you in your past? Don't bring your baggage over to me. I did not do that. Let's go ma'am. So don't make me, don't make me pay for another man's mistakes. Yep. That's the line. That is the exact, that is the exact same thing.


How that relevant. So if you are, so if you're going to regard somebody with complete suspicion just based on past experiences that you've had, like how do you move forward in a relationship? How do you, how do you develop any level of trust with this person? Like how you can't, like you can't have it both ways. And that was But you just included the other way. No and no. And that was the point. And that was the point of the conversation. And that was where Mark was coming from too. Mark Was wrong Too. No, he was not. You and Mark were wrong. Why do because you say so? No, because you're emboldened by Because no matter what we say, it's still your time. No matter what we say up here, It Is your time. Somebody sent me the argument. I got you. What do you think? Ish? And, and, and listen, I couldn't have wasted my time because I planned to get somewhere with the lies I told you.


Mm. And I got there. I lied with intentions. What I got with that, I lied. What intention was you could have started off and all of that stuff been the truth. And throughout that particular relationship, your feelings changed or that person wasn't. When you start a relationship with somebody, this could be where you really want to go. I really want to get married. I want really wanna do all these things with you Until we see her Dirty as bad. I know that that's Yeah. No. Until we see How she keeps her car. Yeah. Or just some or until you and I don't necessarily get along at that clip that I thought that we would. So the way I felt three months ago, I don't necessarily feel that. And So you don't feel like speaking up, please Finish.


Okay. Right. So three months ago I felt like this and these were my intentions. I don't feel that way no more. That don't mean I led you on with lies in the beginning. My feelings have changed. That don't mean that I started off on bullshit. That was not the, that was not what we were talking about. Mark and I were making the specific point that there are motherfucker that will literally just lie. That's true's true. They'll lie to get the goal and they get the pussy. Exactly. Exactly. And it's just like, that's foul. That is wasting somebody's time. It is wa when you intentionally lie for your own self-serving goals and you know what that person is looking for because they've been explicit in it, then that is, that is wasting somebody's fucking time Question ask, at what point do you, You right you not wrong.


You not wrong man. That time don't jump her. Let me ask you a question. I'm not, Don't jump Just having a conversation. I think You right. I think that It is immoral for somebody to do that. But I also have heard you come in here twice and I don't wanna fight you. I've also heard you come in here twice to say, y'all, y'all stupid ass men. Y'all don't have no intuition. Women got all the intuition. Mm. So to that I say, where's the women's intuition to read the nigga? That's lying Nigga hit it with the alright. It's no, no, no, no. That's no I'm just, it's false equivalent. And that's Oh you could, It is, It is. It's, it's literally a false equivalent. Stop It. I'm sorry. Yo don't one V one. Yo, what The fuck we do Don talk like And you today the fucking do that.


Yo, I'm not beefing today. What are you talking? I'm on your side. I'm on your side. Don't let them gas you to Make I'm not letting, I'm not letting fucking gas me. Okay. They're they're doing, they're doing this thing. You don't an they're doing this thing flipping Joe. You're having an adult conversation flipping Shut, fuck up. Flipping Joe. When I speak in general Cox, he always business. I'm Just kidding. When I speak in, when I speak in generalities, like women have intuition. I did. I'm not making it up. Is there not something known as women's intuition? Yeah, but I think it's okay. I'm not making it up, But, but I think it's, Y'all conveniently Forget it. But it, That's Stop, stop. Intuition does not mean you're psychic. Intuition does not mean that you can't have hope that somebody is just being noble. Sure. And being honest.


Agree. Like why would you go into something with complete and total suspicion with, of somebody why bother? You know what I'm saying? You, you, because we're on No, no, no, no, no. Hold on one second here. And hug. Hold on. No, no. Hold on, hold on. Finish on one slip. And Joe, just Because I have a question for you, man, hold on one Second. Dip. Joe, You literally, I swear to God a I'm just gonna speak from the perspective of being a woman. It's either you are completely jaded and fucking bitter and cynical because you let all of the experiences in the past taint the way that you see men or you are com you're hopeful that this is a new person and you're not gonna, you know, take your experiences from the past and apply it to them. And you just hope that what they are telling you and the experiences that you're having are genuine and you're actually building towards something.


Like you can't have it both fucking ways. No, you Just can't. I'm gonna explain the question. Do you, do you, do you think that by not taking accountability, not you, no. Listen by a person not taking, not you or not, not by a person not taking accountability for being responsible for remaining in the situation. They allow themselves to, they, they treat it like it's just a bandaid. Meaning they don't allow the, they don't want to face the fact that it's my fault that I remain in this. We, so it's easy to say he wasted my time instead of look within and say, next time I'm going to move away easier. I'm going to look for certain signs. I feel like saying somebody wasted my time and not taking accountability that you allowed your time to be wasted.


It's like a bandaid on the deep wound that you won't allow to heal. That's how we Wait. Hold up for a minute. 'cause we jumping you now Apparently. Yeah. Part of, because I spoke, I I spoke to that. I Agree. Did you, did I agree with where he's headed? Right? Like who, who's flip? Like you only presented those two options. I didn't let me talk Now. I, but I did. But no, because no, can you just let really don't matter. No, because you're speaking on something that, that I made clear, Mel, I made clear. Now listen, if you just listen to me, I'm just speaking about something you just said just now. Go ahead. Like two minutes ago you said either we're a jaded from our past experiences, or B, we're hopeful, yada, yada, yada. I think what flip is saying is there are more options than just those two, right?


Like when I'm in the strip club and, and 50 niggas and Pelly jackets come in, I'm not jaded to say, Hey, because of my experiences and because of where I'm from and what I've learned, my radar's Gonna jump You. No, my radar Goes up. No. 'cause they, no. 'cause they all be lovable and, and and great people. But our instincts go up. It's not I'm jaded. It is, Hey, I'm playing probability now. So I think there's more than just those two options of, hey, I'm jaded because they are those women. And that's annoying to deal with for men versus the, I'm hopeful. I'm just glutton to it all and no, that's, that's No, hold on. Well, oh, let's just be clear that jadedness and bitterness and cynicism is not just, it cannot just be related to the women experience.


I have met way. Oh, I'm not saying that I've met a lot of niggas that are, I'm not saying that bitter and jaded and that's number one. You right about that. Right. And number two, when we have this conversation Tuesday, I definitely said there are experiences where, where people, not just women, men, they ignore the signs and that is their responsibility. Yes. You have to take responsibility, you have to take accountability that you had plenty of red flags in your face and you chose to ignore them. That is where you cannot say your time was wasted. And I said that that's true. There are some circumstances where you had all the signs and you chose to ignore them. So now you can't be playing fucking victim. I said that there's some circumstances I am speaking only to the circumstance where a woman approaches a situation or a person approaches a situation and she's, and they are clear on their intent.


And that person just goes about consistently lying to reach their own self-serving goal. That is the only circumstance in which I am talking about where somebody has wasted the other person's time knowing what they wanted and they just had their, their own self-serving goals. So You a question, wait Three more minutes on this. When, when they, when they lie, right? Are they, are they playing a role because that mean, are they playing a role? Do you not see the signs? That's what I'm asking. Wait, I I I can't answer why one person lies and another person. I'm saying like that's, I'm Still, and and I'm trying to, and wait, Hold up and, and yes, humans lie. Yeah. Right. That's, that's a blanket statement. Humans lie.


Are, is there not any counteraction that the person in this case the woman puts forth. That's why I said, hey, did she fuck him? And, and you was taken aback when I said that. But there are counteractions you can take to try to see what someone's true intentions are or get as close to their true selves as possible. We not just gonna let the liar dictate the flow of shit. Okay. So here's the thing. I don't really like to, and that's my final statement. I don't, I don't, I really hate the weaponization of fucking sex in a situation like that. Just keep your pussy to yourself because there is many people that have literally met the fucking their soulmate and fucked them the first night. We're not talking About them. No, but It is, we're not talking about them.


But no, because it counters your fucking argument. It is a counter to your argument that sex is not a dictator as to whether or not a relationship is going to be successful. That's a Mistake man. It's, it, it's not. That's a mistake man. It's not. Lemme ask and I know I'm not talking outta my ass here It is not. Let Y'all get the last one V1 and we moving on. I didn't Even really talk when we acknowledge that quote unquote men are lying. Fuck You freeze. Right? 'cause it's not a man. I'm glad that you fi fixed it and said it's not a man woman thing, but we gonna use men for this example. When a man meets a woman, right? It's a physical attraction. They don't know you. They don't know how you think. They don't know you're ambitious.


They don't know you're smart. They don't know you have an amazing sense of humor in your great parent, none of that. It's a physical attraction. So he's thinking physically. So are we, Okay cool. So are we, you got Now let Mel please lemme talk. Well, you've been running, ain't nobody cut you off. So cool. So when you Fuck that dude in the first day or the first two days, he don't know you. So he's reached his pinnacle in many instances. Right? Okay. So so now when you start saying guys, guys, guys, for a lot of men, not all men, there are examples of niggas that have married a girl that they fucked the first day they met 'em. But that's a rarity. It's outliers to everything. That's a rarity. That's not the norm.


'cause most niggas, once they fuck you that first day, they've reached their pinnacle and they moving on to somebody else that they have to. You know what I'm saying? So, And I ain't saying nothing that I ain't used to do back in my day. The chicks wanted to fuck before I did. Of course they do. No, I'm holding my dick to myself so I can try to see what your true intentions are. You've done it. I've seen it. You ain't lying. I've seen, I've told, I've told male about male. No. Said, you said you said this Bar before. I I, I couldn't attest to that. I've seen you. So, so I'm not just saying women People, my thing is yo dog people, If the lion get me the pussy, then why am I stop lying For dog? We, we think that Conflating two different fucking, we Think that because relationships go south, that the person necessarily was lying.


Sometimes they are lying and sometimes they were not lying. And I'm not talking about Mel's only talking about the nigga that's been lying. The Person and I and stop and stop putting in sex. That's Not all the other stuff. Like How do we differentiate the two? And your examples are always so extreme. Like sex on the first date, sex two days later. Sex. You Brought it up ma Because, because I Brought it Up. I didn't say that. I'm saying how do we differentiate between the two Two people. Okay. Just, just To be the liar and the person I Was just, okay, so just to be clear, you, you missed Tuesday so we had a whole lot on this subject so that you just don't have I got it. And so this is mine and his interaction is basically just carrying on from fucking Tuesday. And my argument is one sentence.


It's your time That that shit, that was my Argument. I don't have nothing else to say other than everybody is responsible for their time. That's true. There's gonna be liars, there's gonna be scammers, there's gonna be con artists, all of that. It's gonna be people that you thought you loved that that made it seem way and it look different on earth. It's gonna be mad shit. Shit. Guess what? And Men not the only people doing that because it's girls that be dating. Of course I said, I literally said that. You just fixed it. I said that. No, but I, I was saying that on Tuesday as well. I know what, that's what I'm trying to, when My time get wasted I go in the room and say damn I fucked it up. Yes. That's like what I Don matter what She did. That's like what I told her on. I know but I know I'm Your day to get lied to. My man told my other man this is funny to my mans right.


My man was mad at this girl one day. That Was three. That was three. And no second. One second. I was in the car with two of my homeboys in and my man was mad that this girl stood him up and he was like, dog It is your day to get lied to. She might have lied to another nigga for you the other day to is your day to get lied to. Yo, when you first meet somebody, people are dating multiple people. Niggas not just sitting on their hands waiting for one man or one woman to sweep them off they feet. So I might be dating three girls when I meet Mel, But nobody's ta. That's understandable. Bring us to a close please. Lemme finish You right. No, he's still talking. I might, nobody's done so I'm gonna lie to Mel and say Yo, I had to go do something with my sister when I really was going to fuck with the next chick.


That's a lie. But I still might be looking for a quality relationship. I just want that one person to overwhelm me to leave these other three girls that I'm fucking alone. That's not the lies that we're talking about though. In closing, that's all I'm gonna say. Okay. That's not the lies that we're not, we're talking, we're not talking about the infancy of getting to know somebody. We're not talking about the first few weeks, couple of months. We're not talking about that because it's understandable. You really actually don't owe anybody anything at that time other than maybe just respect, you know what I'm saying? But if you, you don't have to tell them everything that's going on in your life. 'cause I'm probably not gonna tell you everything that's going on in my life. You have to earn that trust and you build upon that trust by just examples.


Not words that come outta your mouth but actually living, breathing examples and behavior. And you have, there's at what point can you count on somebody? Can you develop that ability to count on somebody that their word is their bond, that they're not lying to you. Like how is it that you formulate relationships if you can't even trust that that is the system that you build a relationship on. Like that's what, that's what we were talking about. I'm not talking about the infancy of a fucking situation because we don't owe each other anything at that point. I don't think we, most relationships ever get to that point. What? Text each other. Okay. I don text each other. Okay. Okay. Okay. We did it. We did it a little, a little quick. Rubber game.


Quick little rubber game. Rubber game. Yeah like when it's one one. The tiebreaker that's called the rubber game. Be there. I've never heard That before. Me either, but okay. Even Jersey City shirt. No you never heard of rubber match. That's that's the sports, that's the sports thing. That's not Jersey thing. What sport? Average sport. Any sport Or game. Yeah. Rubber match. If we play, if you two football teams played twice and they won one, the next game is the rubber match. Correct. I've never heard that. Never heard that. That's crazy. Well Brandon Jacobs should have told you Reggie any won. I've heard tie Brady cry Ain ain't hear no rubber. We weren't talking about that shit. I know. So different Rubber match all we did it nice little rubber.


The words right out my mouth. I ain't say nothing. Alright. It's time for us to get to it. Prayer for those inside the pond and out light is in the air is In air. Rest in peace.

I feel like we gotta be mature during this topic. Come on. So everybody here or most of us have now watched the five Puff Refer to the tag before we start this. Yes. Five part puff doc on MAX. Yes. Yes on MAX. We are not talking about that other one. We're talking about the five part one on MAX Who we usually look to as a good doc source.


Yes. Yeah. Typically Max, HBO, whoever over there. Yeah. And they does Good shit through investigation Discovery. I'm not sure that I necessarily feel that way about this one. What do you think? Don't. Don't shut up and toss it. Us. I don't think that it was the greatest of docs. It started. It was pretty good. It was. No, it was entertaining. It didn't. It didn't, I don't think they didn't add anything If They were out to paint him to be a monster beyond what was known. For the most part, I don't think there was much new information. I agree with that. I agree with that. There were new voices and new people. Yeah. Yes. I was gonna Say and that was cool. That's what did It for me. That was cool to hear from. They did a good job of the timeline.


Yeah, yeah, sure. Across five parts. They walked you through him as a child. Him at uptown him with Andre Cl. Oh yeah, that's uptown him. Andre Royal. That's uptown. Yeah. Then well then Some people don't know that. The Sun Music Club. Anyway. Yeah, Him with Clive him with the reality TV up to the Ciroc and the And the liquor. Liquor shit. And then the final part five was them sitting with one of the drug runners, the assistants or whatever, whatever he was. And he was spilling tea. He had the texts. Yeah, he was showing the texts. Voice. Voice Notes. Voice notes. The last part five. Part five was only 21 minutes long.


But boy it was, it was, that Was the one really? That was the one. Everything else has been fairly public if not super public information for decades in a lot of instances. Well the the accuser, I believe her name was Talia. That story was, that was gruesome. Extraordinarily graphic. Yeah. And gruesome. Yeah. Which one was Talia? Which episode? The girl whose man worked for Puff and then he argued her at the studio. That's Puff move. That's Puff's move too. It appears to be The Ryan. Leslie. Cassie. Oh Yeah. Kim Porter. If you have Man, that ain't just that nigga move. That's a Lot of people. That's A lot of, well I mean outside of the R Part.


Well we're talking about this specific. Oh Because a lot of dudes would be like, oh you fuck with him? Oh I know I could get f she fuck with him. That's a lot of niggas move. I told you the rapper nigga that tried that with you. Well this, This, this is, you didn't See it. Wait, somebody's tried it with me. A rapper. Of Course he's mad at him. Rapper bro. Rapper got shit That shit. No, he tried it while Headache is yours nigga buy Motrin. A lot Of niggas feel like It is, if I could just get her away from him, I got it. Or that nigga's corny. If I, if she a fault for him, I know I'm a get, oh, that nigga drive a what? Well episode I know I could do. Well three, they said they, they chronicled Puff going through the extent of making a fake flyer to get Cassie to Miami so that she's there on work.


Just want Get away from this nigga. I've done that before. Y'all said that was fly. I've done that before. I've done it before because I came in and said that Was some I don't stand shit. And y'all was like, nah, that's fly. If charges come after it, then it's not fly. If charges come after then it's not fly. Yeah. If you do do it, like If you Do it, you just Get her away and she leaves and she with the shit's fly shit. Then that's fly. That's fly If you get away and then kidnap her for the next nine to 15 years against her will. I don't think it's fly assaulter. It is sick. Yeah. If she go on her own free will, It is fly. One of the things that bothered me most, I think is in episode three or four, I want to say four, is the security guy. The security guy says, and I quote Roger, whatever his name was, he says in one breath, when I knew, this is when I knew it was really bad, we were over here and they, they started fighting.


He started kicking Cassie. He started punching Cassie like it was a fight in the next 10 minutes. He says, Yeah man, anybody that, anybody that know Cassie, she don't tell it all right away. But she used to speak, she used to speak to me because we had like a father, like a father daughter relationship. Like I saw her like a daughter to me that didn't sit right with me for the rest of the shit. So You let the, so you let the, So you saw her like a daughter, but you let take but you let her get her ass beat without saying anything. Right. Which is why when I watch these docs, I do think that some of the people that they show need to be vetted. I agree.


Yeah. I'm not just talking about the Puff Doc. When I watch docs and they bring on people to talk about their experience on the side. Tell me, tell me a little bit about them. Tell me if they worked at Kroger. Tell me fucking where they was born. Tell me what their Family relationship We're. Complicit in ball. Saw a bunch of shit and did an Interview. Me how to fall out for decades. The fallout. The fallout being important. That's, its it. Tell me why y'all don't speak no more. Tell me how y'all fell out. Because that speaks volumes. Even I remember when the r Kelly shit was going on and they was like, yo, we was on the tour bus and the door flew open on the tour bus by mistake. Like they hit a bump and the door flew open and they said they looked inside and saw what they saw. And I'm like, okay and y'all just kept working with this nigga for the next seven, eight years.


So at some point, in my opinion, your character and your moral compass is off too. And you doing anything for some money. So my nigga, you ain't really the, you know what I'm saying That you're trying to be, now listen, too many people on this dock would blatantly said repeatedly, damn man, I feel so bad now. I feel so bad now. I didn't say anything and that was because of, but I feel like I can make it right today. It was like, nigga no, You can't make it right. No, you can't make it right. And if that nigga still had you on payroll, you wouldn't be trying to make it. Right. And what's your motivat and what's your motivation for making it right today? That's the point I'm saying you ain't on the payroll, so now I'm gonna pay you back nigga. Right. Or not even pay you back. I just bandwagon shit. Yes. It ain't even no personal thing.


Shit, I'm getting interviews. Niggas might pay me for some interviews. All of that shit. I also think some of them people in there will lying. I ain't See it. I'm not pointing out who I think was lying, but some of them people, it just didn't sound, some Of the stories that I've heard, they Don't, it didn't sound right. Yeah, I agree. Like the interview is sitting here, we, you know why we brought you here. You know what we're doing and you know what we need you to give us. Tell me about what happened. Oh, it's just, I don't, it's just too tough to tell you Why you here. I mean, what I can tell you is he was a different person. Yeah. Okay. You got it Bro. I, I You got it.


I think the people that are lying are gonna do the people that are telling the truth a disservice. Agree. Yeah. 'cause I believe this. I believe there's both. Yeah. Yeah. I believe that there are some people that have some truthful shit. I believe that there's some people that's gonna say some lying shit. And I think with the caliber of lawyers that his money can provide, I think they gonna get some of those lies on the stand and they going to eat they fucking lunch. And what it's gonna do is create reasonable doubt for the people that are telling the truth. Right. Wow. I still don't think he could have but so much money left. That And also, and Also, or even if that It is not true today. Not true. He Got money again. They didn't look, They, I Hear you. Listen to this. He came up with 50 that he ain't have to spend.


He's still locked up. He had 50 to bail out. He ain't, they ain't take it. Got it. He ain't spend 50 in six months. Let's see what that 50 looks like around the summertime. Yeah. Yeah. Like It is $50 million though. It's still, it's a lot of money. I think when you're playing at a certain clip, the shit that you're paying for is with Different lawyers. It is different. I'm not disagreeing And it's not just lawyers. I'm sure you know, you gotta get specialists. No Researchers, professionals. It's $50 million money for sure. Like I, I, in my opinion, I think You'd be shocked how fast somebody could spend Off. Yeah. And not exactly. And nigga I've paid lawyer fees for years, Not these lawyers. Damn shit. I know. So OJ that's what I'm telling oj. OJ I know what my lawyer ran.


Look, look money. Look at it this way. You don't think 50 people might want a million dollars out of this? No. Ish. Not in a year. No, I don't think he pays 50 individual people. That's what, A million dollars. That's what, that's not what he said. He said that's not what he said. He said do you think 50 people would want a million dollars out of this? Right. You Mean as a, when you say 50? Both. Both lawyer fees. Anybody that's coming to us. You mean paying people off to say the fuck. Quiet. Oh yeah. A bunch of different Shit. Of course that's possible.

This is just the digger talking about, he brought me in the back to this room and told me to have sex with this girl.


It was consensual. The girl said, yeah, he looked at the girl, he said, will you have sex with him? She said, yes I will. And I was forced to have sex with this woman While he stood there.

And I'm sure there was some level of NDA and there was some level of agreement that he signed prior to working for Puff.


I'm sure. Of course, Of course, of course. So that might have been a little Specific. That means somebody could get meek for when we go to the strip club. Like when me, Mel and Imani or whatever went to the strip club and I go grab a girl and put her on on Mel. Yes, Yes, yes. Nigga. Yes. Nigga Mel can say she felt obliged to do that because of the power dynamic. Yo, this dead Ass. I'm telling not trying be funny. You Right. No, you're right.

Ah, that's, that's you got his book coming. Best bestseller. And They gonna Talk about, I'm gonna ask that question. There you go. Well now we going now. There you go. You getting better? No, I just, I don't want What else? What else, what else, What Else? Talking about the, the DC crash Have at it. So a, a Black Hawk helicopter crashed into American Airlines flight.


Yeah. American Airlines flight. That was about to land in DC It's caught on video. Just respect to all the victims because it's a lot of side talk going around, want know to get into. But The victims, the pilot, the copilot, the stewards. All all victims. Yeah. Victims. The families like this. Imagine. Yeah. But I wanna shout 'em all out 'cause there's some news reporters out there. It is some news reports out there that, that that was saying, did y'all hear that there was no VIPs on the flight? Did y'all hear that one? No, I didn't hear That. Yeah, no. VIPs were on the, on the helicopter Everyone That, that, that was disgusting. Yeah, it's crazy.


The only one of the only things I heard was Trump tried to blame the crash on DEII was like, what the Fuck? Well we getting here, I think. Yeah. We didn't think that's where going. Yeah. But yeah, every, every Yeah. To say there's no VIPs was disgusting. Yeah. Nasty. And one of them reporters to, to a husband waiting on his wife that said, Hey, I was just texting with her 10 minutes ago. And in all communication see's stupid ass reporter talking about can I see the text? That's fucking disgusting. There's a lot of disgusting behavior going around surrounding bro, like mass tragedy. There's News for content purposes. Media. Yeah, content. All of that shit is disgusting my nigga. Like, yo, we really have lost the sensitivity piece When, when this, when reporting tragedy, It is really about the most salacious shit you can find.


So it's somebody waiting on their wife to come out. You're like, can I see the text? You mind if I take a picture of that nigga nasty? Take a picture of this. Niggas want to take pictures of the Roddy to be the first one to pose all of that shit. It's, it's the rush to be first. It's the rush for the exclusive. We totally lost all human decency. They said that the, who are the, what's the people name that the FAA The the traffic controllers. Air traffic Control. Air, Thank you. Air traffic controllers. They said that the airport or the air, the area where the air traffic controller is, they were unst. Understaffed. Understaffed, yes. Thank you So much. But from my report and I got a, it Was like 19 when it's supposed to be 30. I got an inside report that said basically that everybody at the airport did everything the right way.


Everything was done accordingly. The, the, the mistake rest solely on the Black Hawk pilot. They were talking to the black Pilot and the video it showed it looked like that. Yeah. They said the Black Hawk pilot. They were asking him, yo you do you not see this plane in front of you? And he was nonresponsive so Well no, in one of them he replied, yes, I see the plane. And then they kept asking him as he keeps going and going and going and going. It's like, yo, my nigga, there's a Theory out there that says maybe he thought he saw one plane and that wasn't the plane that they were talking about. I won't, I can't They said that. Speak To that. But when you watch the video, it did look like that shit almost crashed into about four different planes.


But they were saying that it's mad lights, like it's nighttime and there's so many lights that it can be blinding airport for the airport. Exactly. In the metropolitan city especially. And then I heard that In one of the busiest airport In the country. It's a huge airport in the country. It's DC So they said that also like that airspace is a different level of restricted airspace. We talking about DC my nigga. Yeah. Capital building. So many ba Yeah. So many buildings and important buildings like outside of New York. It might be the most important place in the, maybe more important than New York. And they saying that dude was just doing some shit. That was wild shit. The the Black Hawk pilot was just on some other shit. But He lost his life As well. Right. He did saw be rest in peace.


Yeah, rest in peace as well. But they, but for Trump did now he barely was sympathetic to the victims being because He's not gonna accept response. This we like did the lead us. So there's a whole article in Time Magazine about this where it's discussing the fact that Trump is now in office and all of his cabinet members, like he's appointing people. And so the article, it's in Time magazine, it says just days before the crash, president Donald Trump enacted a sweeping shakeup of federal agencies responsible for aviation oversight. Removing the administrator, administrator of the transportation security administration, the TSA and eliminating all the members of the key aviation security advisory group, the Feder, the FAA, which regulates airlines and aircraft manufacturers and manages the nation's airspace was also without permanent leadership at the time of the crash because its top official.


Got into it with Elon and basically resigned. So That's sick. That's so the first thing you do for damage control is blame Biden. Right. You know what I'm saying? Like the first thing you do, your first report is blame Biden. It's disgusting bro. Even when I heard the dude from American Airlines get on his first two or three sentences, he was like, yeah, such and such is a wholly owned subsidiary of blah blah. Like you talking about insurance shit and You know what I mean? Liability shit. Instead of addressing these people that lost their life in your first two sentences is disgusting to me. Agreed. Agree But but aren't like black hawks like military personnel. Yes.


So Highly trained you with that. Exactly. So wouldn't it just behoove you to kind of think that the increased military presence is a direct order from Trump? So if he's the Commander in chief, Indirectly it's been there a Week. This is he been there a week or two? Maybe, maybe not. He's Done a lot of shit inside of a week Or two. He, but I don't know about if it went down that far. My thing is dog, I don't know if you can address it as a mistake. Yeah. Don't address it as yo this is their fault. Or start pointing the fingers. I think all of that shit is goofy when 70 people lost their lives. I think that shit is just disgusting my nigga. I just think it's trash. Agreed. Whether we can Blame before they've pulled these bodies Out, out of the fucking water before Families have been notified. Yes.


That's the thing. Like whatever you call yourself attributing this to It's time's the time. It's time and the place, it's not the place of Tom. But that and then his, the people that are being, that are reporting on it, you could tell they so scared of the nigga that they tapping that they tap dancing. Oh, Donald Trump said that this is a direct result of DEI hires. What do you feel about that? And they'd be like, we going to just look at all the evidence and then we'll come to a Oh they said it's gonna take a year for them to come to a direct conclusion. They'll have some pertinent information in 30 days. But the investigation will take for the most part 12 months for them to come back. Wait. Then the news started putting up pictures of some of the people that was on The fight and that I can't watch that.


I can't watch that bro. I think it was ice. Many ice come On. The black lawyer, the the teenage kids that was doing The, I'm watching. I cut that shit off. Good. They showed the whole staff, the the the pilots. Yeah. And the black girl. That was the flight attendant. I was yo that shit was bad. Really disturbing. Again, our hearts go out to Everybody. Yeah. Everybody. Yeah. For real. The family, the friends America. Period. Period. You were the travelers. Yeah the travelers. Travelers. Because it was another crash too. That wasn't the only plane crash couple days before.


Yeah. Yeah. There was a whole nother plane crash at some point. If regular pedestrians just start seeing planes crash like as a common thing. Yeah. You're not getting them flights. There's, There's A Theory floating around. There Is About the crashes and the increase of them. It's to put the fear of people and getting in planes. 'cause they wanna try to put some type of under Ground. Yeah. Under, under the water. Yeah It is. To drive the demand for that fear is the biggest motivator. I said that last time the Paul You did. I said that. You know, do you think that there's a objective here They are trying to put a underground shit that train station under LA to New York. Yeah. Under the water on London to New York, London to New York one. They've been trying to do that.


So I don't understand. Let's let's unpack conspiracy theories after they've pulled bodies of water. Don't want us to do the same thing. That recent Piece that those involved Absolutely. That's peace. Those that affected our condolences to Your family. Whereas everybody's family's out there who I Can't imagine, you know when you to think about how just things just change right.

It is, It is disturbing. Extremely unfortunate. And again, again our prayers go out to the family, friends, loved ones of all the victims. Of all of the victims. It's a horrible, hopefully we as just onlookers don't have to continue to see again. He ain't been in there two weeks or he ain't been in there two weeks Bro.

They basically say that, You know what I'm saying? All of these niggas with power, it ain't just Puff, it's just mad niggas that get to a certain level of success. That's what they used to. Donald Trump is used to that. They brought up his speech again from the Lifetime Achievement Awards. He won. Yeah. With the nasty one where he was like, and shout to Cassie for the dark times. It's like, yeah, that's crazy dog. You are nuts. It just show what type of monster you deal with bro. Some niggas, I'm gonna take this moment to remind you. I'm him. I'm, yeah, I'm him. Yes. Because that also is a form of abuse. Yep. I recognize that. But It's a different level of arrogance bro. Like and it, but it just said to me and you might be disconnected.


Well no it said to me how long he may have known about what was to come behind the scenes. No, they said that that comment was what made her say, alright fuck this. Yeah they said that and that was why she started the, I don't know if I believe that, But they said that She's sitting at home with her two, two children and he still trying to like, you know, bait her. Nah, he was antagonizing. That Was too odd though on Instagram and all that shit. I heard. What's That? Yeah, when she got married he put the post up. Yeah. All all of that type of shit.

I was there. I don't wanna be there. No, they they, I don't wanna call a nigga broke on national tv the nigga they said the nigga wasn't necessarily broke.


I take it back. There you go bro. I'm just trying to have fun. Me too, me too. You Was deal when they told you remember everything I for forgot. I don remember how convenient and Once a nigga start telling me about how good of a guy somebody is, I tune it out. That's the shit. Think I ain't listening to this shit. Thought your Parents. Sure. Thos and prayers. Thoughts and prayers Also, Terry er of the Miami Heat, formerly of the Charlotte whatever their names is. The Bobcats C Hornets and Tic Hornets. They again, they Hornets game Hornets. Oh they back to the Hornets in the cel. Yeah. And the Celtics. Yeah. But the game, the game that they're highlighting is a Hornets game. It is a Hornets game that he supposedly threw Terry er is under investigation for his alleged involvement in the gambling ring that is tied to Jte Porter.


Who they already got Niggas ratting. Yep. Niggas ratting. Well no. Well maybe, maybe. But they said this was a little suspicious. Let me find my notes because around the game in question there was a young lady tweeting in a now deleted tweet of course saying Hey I'm betting the under on. Oh I'm with they was, they was killing the girl for fucking with Terry Rodier. And she said something to the effect of, yeah I'm with 'em betting the under though, so fuck what you talking about? And then that was the game where, let me find the game.


Let me find the game. 'cause it was shady. Okay, let's see y'all talk. Yeah, Because that's crazy. I don't See that wrong with just, just that part. How you say under it, it's shady if it Ends up being the game question was March 23rd, 2023. He was a Hornet. He only played nine minutes and 34 seconds. He finished with five points, four rebounds and two assists before leaving with a foot injury. He didn't play the last eight games of the season as a result either. And Ger is not charged with a crime or accused of wrongdoing at this moment. But federal prosecutors are investigating whether Terry Ger manipulated his performance in 2023 as part of an illegal sports betting scheme.


That is nowhere near enough of me. Yeah, that's nothing. Especially because he didn't play no more after that. The nigga might have really been hurt. That's one. And number two, that nigga was kicking up. If you only played nine minutes, you had five points, four rebounds, and two assists. You was getting busy. If you make up an injury and check yourself outta the game and now everybody that bet under on Terry er hit, then you're, we're Investigating. I'm not disagreeing, but you ain't have to do what you did in that nine minutes, Joe. That hard to do. Listen, five points, what was the line? Four rebounds and two assist is hard to do in nine minutes, bro. Six or nine. It's Hard to do in nine minutes. That's very hard to do. That's not easy to do. It is. Nobody is debating whether Terry Gie is nice tonight.


He's nice, But I could have played lackadaisical. I ain't have to, you know what I'm saying? You left the game, which is the same trick that, and I ain't come back no more this season. That's the same trick. No. Yeah. But that's the same trick that Jontay Porter was pulling with, Hey I'm injured, I need to not play anymore. All Right. His prop bets that night was around 21 and a half 0.6 assists and four rebounds In the event that you fake an injury and get out the game and now the whole country has hit on you. We're investigating you. That that's all I'm saying. Yeah, I, I'm Terry R is nice. He been in the slump recently but I'm not disagreeing. It Is been the worst slump of all. Like, Like if it was going up and down, up and down, I would say yeah but that just one game.


That's not proven enough for me. I'm not saying he didn't do what they accusing are accusing him of doing what I'm saying. You Don't think that's enough to be investigated? No. Oh You crazy. Okay, so wait, there's more. So Get him freeze and This, this tweet is still up. Somebody posted the whole shit and everything and he had 'em for under six and a half assists and his tweet says, at least I was in on it today. Got lucky that I was fed some inside info that Rose was leaving in the first or second quarter depending on the game flow in live lines. So that his unders would hit. That's and he posted, he posted his slip. That's different. That's totally, that's totally different. Yeah, that's, and he's saying I got inside info that he's leaving early on the same day of the game.


That's some other shit. That's different. That's other shit. Oh, That's what I thought I was saying to y'all. No that's not that was said different. That's yeah, If you're part of a gambling ring and you fake your own injury to leave the game so people can hit under Yeah. A nigga. All I Didn't say was people Tweeting but yeah, a lot of that proves that niggas knew he was gonna do that. So look, got it. Even more, a couple of the sports books pulled the roset lines report game so the people that got it in early got it in, he was still gonna play. And I guess they got win too of what was going on. So they took him down. You Can't bet him.


Oh damn. Yeah these niggas talk too much. I I fuck with Terry Rossier. Yeah he tough. I do. He can play. He can play. Yeah. I cannot believe, let me not say that. That's Not true. I Can't either. That's not true. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. I can't believe that players Terry Rose is a little different from fucking JT Porter. He got his back. Yeah. Te is much some dude that was making 350 K. Yes. And I gotta make ends meet. Yes, he got paid. You are correct man. What you I could, you could, we've seen shit where some, one of your peoples is into it with somebody and you gotta make right for them. True. That's possible. We've seen there's ways where it could come back to, nigga, I gotta, I'm pay you outta my pocket bro.


That nigga signed a $96 million deal. You in it with Joe how much he owed you. Yeah. I don't understand that here. I Don't, I'm not throwing no game and risking my career over a hundred million dollars over some money at all. If Joe owe you $3 million and you gonna fuck him up. Huh? I'm gonna take, I'm gonna write you 3.5. We good. 3.5. I'm give you extra 5,000 for your, for your inconvenience here nigga you owe me $3 million but I'm not throwing my a hundred million. And he's still young. He could, he about to get another re-up Was Well he still, You playing around Adam Silver, one of the best attorneys on the planet. Nigga Like Yo dog.


Y'all Keep thinking, y'all keep thinking Adam Silver, just the commissioner, the, I think A lot of these athletes know what's going on and they play the game. That's possible. I'm gonna be honest with you. I'm I'm, I wouldn't Well I'm gonna chill. Yeah, I I I'll Leave it alone. All right. I'm calling all of them stupid. It would be stupid. I'm calling each one of them stupid. 'cause Jte Porter ain't even, he ain't even cake off really from what's been reported to risk it all like that or to put the heat on my brother who's just signed the big contracts nigga is crazy. This nigga's made $126 million my nigga Roger. Yes. Yeah, I'm not playing with him. And He's still in his, that's just to date. Right. He still got 50 million left on his contract and then he gonna get another contract after that.


It might not be a hundred mil but it might be because the salaries is going up Dog. When niggas stop me in the street and be like, yo, y'all gonna talk about this in the pod tomorrow. I be like chill, chill, chill. You know what I mean? I can't give you the sauce because I can't, I can't let you know a little different but kind of the same to me. I'm not telling nobody outside nothing about my gig. Yeah, I I'm Terry hold your head dog. Yeah. Yeah man Ho hold your head while we're on sports or Hornet business. Lalo Balls snub or not for the All Star. All-Star game. Definitely a thousand percent. Who? Who? The guards. I couldn't disagree More on the bench. Yeah.


Cade Keep going. I'll pull it up. How about to look, I'll pull it up. Cade don't get a guaranteed vote over him. Yes he does. Cade is tough though. No C ain't been killing. They both been killed And and they've been winning. Jalen Brunson and Donovan Mitchell, Jalen Brown, Darius, Garland, Cade, Dame Lillard, Tyler Hero are the guards. He got an argument. I'm not letting him in. He has an argument. He has an argument but they won 11 games. You didn't impact winning. Your stats are great. I'll have to talk about Tre Young.


Tre Young leading the league and assists shit. Trey ain't there. Tre Young leading the league and assists and averaging 20 points. I think he's the first guard ever to average 20 points and more than tennis Assist multiple seasons and not make all Star either one. I had the conversation about Trey Young Lalo Ball, you won 11, 12 games. I'm Not, I don what happens? I don shit. Alright, so this is what happens. The fans pick the starters, right? Fans pick the start Not solely. Yeah, I think so. Think I think they changed that. Alright. But I know coaches and, and They did change it because Jalen and Kat was 50% fans, 25% players and 25% coaches. So it's not just the fan vote anymore.


Okay. Oh yeah. Fans account for 50% players in media account for 25% a piece. So before and Coaches You don't say that players and, but whatever, it's fine. Okay, cool. Allegedly people don't, like Trey says attitude is shitty. So if your attitude is shitty, I could see how the media, the coaches and the players will vote you out of sitting on a bench. So if you don't automatically get to the starter role, then your odds of getting a a a bench spot could be less than favorable. I understand that. Even though he's a monster.


He a monster but I could See that and now he might not have got Snubbed 'cause, 'cause, 'cause to for him to not make it then somebody else would've been in his seat. Cade has been killing. Right. Dame Lier is Dame Lier. Especially with the fans because I don't necessarily even know if Dame Lila is having a way better season than Ball is having. My nigga Balls had a couple 50 point games this year he's killing. So He also missed a lot of time with injuries and again they got 12 wins, shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I Ain ain't getting up.

But you asking me now do I Got 'em? Got 'em. You can't have a clear memory for 2021 for the shit that you want to have a clear memory about. And now you get a foggy memory about one specific or two specific text messages. It's gonna create reasonable doubt. There's a reasonable doubt that you're lying with, with a agenda, bro. Oh, here's where he took the stand. Hold on. We got more. Here's where he took the stand on the first time.


Right now We see like whatever this was. And then I'm right behind the lo I'm saying if you brought a gun, use it. Then like the fuck he brought a gun full pussy.

I don't know if I would roll the dice with a all white jury. I don't know if I would roll a dice with only having to do six months and only having to do six months.


Sound like nothing to us. Right. I mean, but The six months It's not, it might not be that part Where we from. Not say that They don't really have. It does. It does. But I, I said the shit is in California. California got a different type of gun laws. I heard. Like if you just got a gun, nigga, you going jail New York. If you gun, it's California in New York. Gonna jail. Yes. So I I I just, he got enough money where honestly speaking, the six months would literally fly by from him. But maybe it's not that part. It's the probation. I wouldn't give a fuck about the probationary report. I says It is again, that's a lot of people. That probation part be the hard part. What you looking at? 24, 24 years.


I gimme three years probation. I got you. I got you. Like this is the thing. If I'm confident enough where his current life is him and his lady, they, they 50% on in the United States or less they overseas. If your probation says I could go live overseas with my family and all that other shit, yo 36 months will fly by you talking 10 years, 20 years probation like they gave thug. That's something different. Three years probation. Fam. I think in my opinion, when you looking at 24 years, you gotta kind of weigh your options. Yo, you being away from your kids for four months and you being away from your kids for 20 years is a totally different ballgame to me. For sure. I agree.


I don know from the kids, black people. I don't, I don't know. I don't know black people to respond well to the plea offers. They No, no. What what Majority of the offers Most people plea. Most people plea. Most people plea. That's why the fifth. See what you hear, I'm looking at how much. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Most people plea That ain't got shit to do with how you feel hearing a plea. Oh Yeah, dude, you, You think About it. No, no. Yeah. Do when they say we gonna give you 50 years or you gonna take this 18 months, you go, I would go. You get what I'm saying? I would, I would do. That's what people do. I would do that. I I I don I don't want write him off in the event that he has a shot at this.


I hope he does. And he's absolutely correct. And it's just a bunch of lies. Like, I want to still leave that on the table. I mean, but from the outside looking in it, it just looks a little And look at the other side of that. Like I'm s like with the thug trial, you know what I'm saying? Thug's lawyer was saying, we don't want, don't take the plea. Don't take the plea. We Can beat this. We got it. He Takes it. Well, I'm listening to Drew. Nah, I'm listen. If Drew Drew not listen, say something. I'm listening to Drew. Listen, I'm not listening to Drew shit. If I'm thug, I'm not listening to Drew. He listened to him. I haven't, no, he didn't listen to him. No. His lo his lawyer told him, don't take the plea lawyer said Don't take it. Thug's lawyer told him, don't take the plea fam, I can go home today. Does he have Drew or Brian today?


I can go home to Drew. Drew's out wearing a young thug, merch, Whatever. I don't care if his name is Johnny Fam. I could go home today and I'm only on probation. I got time served. I'm not gonna do no jail time. I'm going home. Bro. They made a, a fool of the, it was Atlanta. Atlanta prosecution. They made a fool of them. I take it back, these niggas gonna get me and y'all not going to be able to retry the case. Oh yeah. Let me outta here. I do the probation if I'm thug. Listen, all I gotta is start is some prisons. Oh yeah. To everybody involved. Yeah. That's it. Let me just make sure no one needs our help.
