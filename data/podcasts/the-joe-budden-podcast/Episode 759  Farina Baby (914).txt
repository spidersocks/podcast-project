Yeah. I just put my lube in the Ziplocs. You know you got three ounce for for the trip. The portable lube. What? The portable loop nigga I gotta show what It is. Yeah. Imagine Everybody got some nice shit down there. Nice lube. Yeah. And a little sex packet that might. Little sex bag shit. Yeah. Yeah. Put that shit right next to the fruit. Get some cartel lube. Yeah. Got gun powder in it. Get gun. You ont Cartel lube pleasure yourself before the B and e. What's up? I'm chilling. Yeah, Like y'all sound like y'all wanna get to it.


Let's get to it to. Y'all sound like y'all ain't with to small talk. We small talked enough. Alright, come on. Let's get to it. Shannon Sharp. Shannon Sharp. Sharp was on IGN live banging. And I'm saying that for the kids listening, trying to abide by the YouTube rules that I've already broken and not cursing in the first 20 minutes, but it's over there. Chand Sharp was fucking on Insta Live and we heard it and I kept the fouls. He First said that he was hacked. We all said that that was Cat. Yeah. We knew he wasn't Hacked then. He already, he went on the show, cleaned it up, talked with jazz, said he wasn't hacked.


ESPN says there will be no ramifications for this. I already knew that Paul Pierce was not gonna like that. He did not. He went off on a tangent. Did he? Yeah. Yeah. I'm not surprised. But. yeah, He posted on his story. Those are Different situations though. But anyway, Shannon was fucking, let's, let's keep it with that. He was fucking, Shannon was fucking the shit outta Michelle. Yeah. Poor, poor Michelle or not. I mean he was or he wasn't. I ain't about to be the the judge of it. My big takeaway was maybe that's how, how old is Shannon? Like that's how 50 plus sex sound. I think that sound like the older version of what I be doing.


I think like she was, she called that nigga papa That I feel like once you turn 50 it unlocks the poppa bag in the bed. No woman has ever called me. Pop Pa I don Pop pop Pop and Daddy. Yeah. Yeah. Papa Nigga. You are 56 and Up. Did somebody called you Papa? No, with that. With the, with the Spanish dialect. Yeah. Papa, go ahead. No, I'm good. Okay. This is the one time that he didn't want use the span. Yeah. I'm fucking Spanglish. Yeah, I'm good.


Yeah, he 56. Y'all guys made him do that. Y'all take the blame. Y'all been calling this man out his name saying that he's, you know all these things and y'all made him show y'all that he get pussy. That's you, you peer pressured Poor Shane Sharp into go on on live, putting his phone down and fucking it Ain't the easiest To, that's what people are saying. It Ain't the easiest to start up the live. I don't think. Let's slow down 'cause both of these are very important points and I don't wanna breeze by Sure. Either of them. People are saying that he did this in response to some of the allegations and rumors. Rumors, rumors that have been attached to his name.


I think they Got it all Fucked up. When You Well me too. But you go first on why I watch his show at the beginning. There is a very clear advertisement for bone pills. This is a layup. Okay. Why? Why? He's got a a, a ad deal with a company that sells erection pills when on the, on the, the recap shit that they did. He's up there flashing the pills on camera every two seconds. Ta-da. I'm not all the way mad at that. My only, my problem with what Flip is saying, if that's true and the rumors are if, if they're right that he's responding to something.


Oh fuck. Be careful don Don't even wanna be the one to say, I'm gonna say it. The problem with That is I don't think that people were saying that Shannon Sharp is gay. People would definitely say That would say. He was definitely saying that. People would definitely saying Yeah. Yeah. But that's reckless internet chatter. Definitely. I think what they were saying is Shannon Sharp is bi. I don't think anybody doubts that Shannon Sharp was sleeping with women, Joe. Nobody said he was bi, But in today's society, yeah. Yeah. If you're not part of that community, you might view that as gay. So him fucking a girl I don't think really clears nothing up.


I wish they'd text me in the think tank order group chats because there's nobody to say that. As soon as Michelle left, darl didn't come in here, man, Stop. See he's why He knew. I'm saying but Michelle don't, Michelle don't disprove that Darryl is in the Uber. So see, isn't this great? My flight leaves at eight, his flight land at nine. My game just for a while. This is, this is why he did what he did. I know I shouldn't be the one say stop. I shouldn't be the one say that. No, I'm not saying that. I believe that The nigga put his live on and put it down and placed it down. He didn't even throw It. Nigga. Now back to Parks' Point. I'm with you. Let's get to it.


It is difficult to Insta live by mistake. And yes, we want to give grace to our elders. Technology can be difficult. That should be whooping they ass. He's already said that he's never Insta Live before in his entire life. But that's part of what made me look at him funny because if you've never Instagram Insta Live before in your life, then When you get to that screen. don don't think it's just gonna be on live. It's gonna be your stories first. It'll gives you a little walkthrough. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. If you've Never installed live Oh yeah. When, you get to that screen. It ain't just gonna be on live. You never use it. It's gonna give you the whole, I'm assuming that Not even that live, Not even that.


It's going give you the, with This access your microphone, access your camera, like All of that. You gotta, Okay. This shit. First Live is so When. you press the thing, It is post story Real live. Live is last. Yeah. And then once you get to live, everything will. Yeah. Live is last. I just said exactly. Now I'm, I'm just here to speculate and have fun with This. shit. Everything he's saying could be 100% the truth. I wouldn't know. I, I had put the phone in in in my pocket before and it did some shit called somebody True for sure. Took a picture. It's done something. I've never been on live. But from what I hear, it's like three or four steps that you gotta go through. You have been on Live When, you was had the split screen showing your kitchen off during the interview late at night.


That Is true. That wasn't live. That wasn't live. What was It? It was Zoom. Oh, I take it back. Damn. Because you Been on Live Took the Unfail Been live. I've never opened a live. Oh you mean you never started a live I never Started a live So I Don't know what I'm not saying. No. I've seen this nigga on Live all Like don don't know what that entails, but from what I heard, you gotta go through Mad Steps. It's a couple steps. You a program in the, in the, in the Android. You gotta, you gotta go to, you gotta take that to the genius part. The Geek Squad. Don't listen to Bitch. I think you Need a separate social security number. The Geek Squad To go live with the answer. Yo, you seen a new black bird?


I did Bring the Blackberry back. Yeah, bring it. Okay. It's fine. I mean I think for the people that have been Blackberry people. Yeah. Really? I mean don don't know I never touched you. They ain't paying me neither nigga. Good Boy. But anyway, go ahead. No, I heard that it's like steps and you know what I mean? You gotta go through it. I heard you can't, it's not like pocket dialing somebody It is not so UNC line. Poor Shannon man, punk line. That's it. Poor Shannon. I don't think poor Shannon at all. I think he got nothing but good outta this. But what I'm saying, When I Mean they might be an on dm. Hold on, hold on. Oh they're definitely, they probably in His DM might be about it. They ain't it. I don't see where he loses Michelle ain't got Nothing on me. They might be in his dm.


I'm Saying Poor Shannon at, you know, like you look at it different. I look at it, you look at it from a marketing standpoint, I'm looking at it from a peer pressure standpoint. From allowing the internet to get to your mind. That you have to pull a stunt like that. That's how I'm looking at it. That's why I said poor Shannon. But that's, if that's, if he did it for that Reason, yo, the internet is there for us to pull stunts. True. That's what It it's there for. Everybody is on there pulling a stunt. Jesse Smollett hired them niggas sent them the subway Home Depot. Yo get the noose. That was crazy. And the American flag and the bleach Joe. That was crazy. Joe. I'm I'm yo and that shit fucked. Tell you, I sit home and think about what we've had to endure. It is really crazy shit that has happened and that Fucked up his whole life.

It wasn't him double. It was somebody else. Is that confirmed? Yes. Yes. Oh, Okay. I'll Show you. Yeah, It ain't hyperbole. I mean Okay, because everybody was Saying that anyway. That's some wild shit. That wild. I I'm saying listen, the stake, The lens that people go to. Yeah. When his big money involved That is one of The thoughts. I had Shannon seem like he just came outta one of them meetings. you know, rumored he had in them nine figure talks. It seemed like he came outta one of them meetings and they was like, Hey, this is how much we could get with the engagement we have and this is how much we could get if You can turn the engagement and spiked it up little bit.


Y'all think we the only ones thinking fourth quarter bully. Yeah. Nah, you Right. And not just that yo like he went on and announced like a, a roast show or something happening next time. Yeah, they a yeah. You get what I'm saying? Like you could use sort of that bro gave him some content. No, let's, alright, we got something we get we want to do. Let's give him a reason. Let's give him a reason. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Yeah. Listen, the funny shit about this is just the other day he was barking on Ochocinco about his unprofessionalism. Hmm. And now you fucking online talk about, talk about it. E ESPN said they're not, you know, they're not Of course Not. The first headline was that they were gonna fire him and then they were like, Did they looked at the numbers and said no we're not, he Wasn't firing him.


Him that first gave his big bag. No, that First headline is there is a page It is the NBA central but it's switching some letters around sent Sintel the faith one and they stay getting folks like even the Paul Pierce Thing. And they, y'all y'all old as hell. The Paul Pierce thing. I only saw them post it. So. I didn't even know if that was real. I only saw that NBA Sintel post it. They stay getting folks if Paul, even If he did posted. I'm telling you. Oh he's that he's mad. He's hot. I'm posting it. Paul Pierce is hot, He's hot. I should be able to play poker with strippers online and keep my job if you gonna let him fuck and keep his job and as somebody that has recorded himself fucking a bunch.


When your fingers is slippery and you trying to handle the functionality of the phone properly, you might end up on a screen You didn't mean to be on nigga. I might have was FaceTiming my lawyer by mistake. Like Oh Shit got this off Are. you shitting me So he, oh that nigga probably try. He got the same stand I got probably right there. He didn't have his glasses right there on the table. He didn't have his glasses on because the mic is too close while you fucking, now we, we heard everything. Yeah. Which lead me to say dog, what was you doing with the phone right before you started fucking to where It is right next to you.


And I hear every, oh Michelle, I'm big girl. That shit. Yeah that nigga was, He was in his bag. He Said he threw that shit on the Bed. He was getting into it.

I think it's time to watch the party die. The shit that got to wicked to apologize is different. Get 'em whack than to Spotify. We even killed the killers 'cause they like take innocent lives to burn a whole village. We start over. It is really that time. Why reason with these niggas if they can't see the future first. Why arguing with these clowns? If the circus is well at work, just walk that man down. That'll throw heavy one. A solid. It's love but tough love sometimes gotta result in violence. If you parading gluttony without giving truth to the youth, the graveyard is company. Just tell us what casket the truth. Say party more than bitches. Tell me what are you working for? They glorify scamming. You get chipped over this credit card. Influencers talk down 'cause I'm not with the basic shit but they don't hate me. They hate the man that I represent.


The type of man that never did ride. 'cause I won a favor. The man that resides in patience. So what the soldiers said, the ones that lost it all and learned to learn from that. I do need to work on my patience Inside the book because he concerned with that information. That'll change his life because he earns for that dedication finding out what's right. You can from that Do came in and told y'all. It's for the people that read. It's for the people that read Really got much to work with. How many bitches Harder than a lot of you niggas? I ain't Proud of you niggas at all. I love This shit. Alright. I love This shit. If you had Parks Loving this on the Joe Bud podcast bingo card, I think That's a giving. This is my bag like You are hitting.


All right. Parks absolutely loves it. Little soul loop. I guess we're starting from that way. All right. Big freeze Cool song. I'll never play it again. I'm not mad. This is not bad I don. I don't love, I don't love or hate it. It's just, it's cool. Like I get what he's saying. I understand what the song was meant to do, but this is not something that I would ever go back to listen to again. Okay. Alright. Don't love it. Don't hate it. Cool. We'll never revisit this big freeze. You wanna give everybody your socials? Yeah, Officially Ice add officially ice black Twitter Hall of Fame nigga fuck is y'all talking about out there? Y'all know his body. Big, big Ish Conceptually it was like a eight and a half for me.


I like what he was talking about. I understand everything he was saying sonically. It was like, like to Isis point, it's not something that I'm gonna play. Alright. But I think lyrically it was Cool. Love the concept. Lyrically amazing as far as revisiting this low probability there. Low probability flip. I like the record. I just think the timing is wrong for me. I think it's the wrong time. I think especially after everything that's going on with the whole Super Bowl thing. I just think to put a song out like that, it's just the wrong time. That's the only thing for me that didn't make me really, I like the record. I think it's done. I listen to it a couple of times. I like what he's saying.


But it's like, nigga you already won. It's not the time you got the Super Bowl. People are mad about the Super Bowl and then you drop this record. It is like kicking a dog while it's down. That's how I took it. You took, you took this as a dis record. You took this as a dis. Yeah. Yeah. To me. To who though? To Drake. I, that's how I took it. When I was listening. No, I definitely, I didn't take it as a dis didn't take It. is that at all? I I not at all. It. It's like more critical. He criticizing society. He's criticizing hiphop. He Criticizing I I took it as he Was our Culture. But the Walker man down line is more impactful after many people think that he walked a man down. True. Yes. I don't think he's referring to Drake. I think he's saying this is what it's gonna take from all of us.


Yes, I agree. Tough love. Agree to the people and we'll be better for it if we, if we What about the line? What he, what He said that there's no, there's no turning back. What's the line he said? He said the line as far as I'm gonna continue to play it. I don't know if the line you was talking about is in his first verse. It is in the beginning as far as when he said that there's no forgiveness. The I gotta hear it again. It went to, he said it went too far there as no forgiveness or something to that effect of basically saying that I took it as Nigga It is no room for apologies. They can't come back from it. You can't come back from what happened. And the only situation I could equate that to is with him and Drake. That's why I thought that. Okay. See I take that line to mean the state of hip hop today. The of Our culture. Going back to Where guys Talking about This Shit Essence the line This shit got done too wicked to apologize.


It's different. Tell 'em to get whacked and disqualified. Is That that one? Yeah. I mean you guys are hip hop historians. So you guys think deep I on the surface level, that's what I took it as. I was like the answer wrong Time. But don't do that to yourself. You an afrobeats historian too. you know. Or The reason why, why? I'm gonna tell you the reason why I wouldn't take this as a Drake. Let go Freeze. Put me on As a, as a Drake this 'cause I'm gonna give Kendrick some credit here. This is the same person that said if I catch flight, it's, it's gonna be direct and I'm not sneak this and I'm not subbing. So for you to, if this were a Drake this and you come out subbing like this, It is very hypocritical of everything you just said. But was this a So I'm gonna give him benefit of the doubt and say he wasn't doing that. Got it. Okay. He was actually talking about him just being fed up with where hip hop is today.


And I'm tired of This shit. And it's going to take, basically this is my call to destroy and rebuild type of Got It. This is destroying rebuild. This is not, this is not, It is Bigger than Drake and not just hip hop. Way bigger than Drake Got it. And this is a couple days off of the Super Bowl promo bid saying no round twos. I see some of the thirsty Drake fans out there trying to make it sound like it's some huge though. Oh he is said no. Round twos It is round two. It's not a round two. You totally missed a point. Go grab a book or don't audio book. I don't know me, I just went to TikTok and listened to all the breakdowns that that's what I did. Talk to I. gotta see what's going on. But clearly You can hear that he's fed up. It's almost like, all right, three o'clock high, I got the, I got the school, I got the bully out the way first month of school and now it's time to deal with the rest of you.


Yeah. Like that's what it sounds like. And I'm outta order. I wanna hear from Big Mel. Yes, I like the record. It's, I'm not turning it off if it comes on, but I liked a lot more of the, you know, music that we heard earlier. But it, I thought the timing was weird as well. Unless it's just, this is like a prelude to what is gonna be the content of the entire album. So, and I also didn't take it as like a full on Drake disc. I understand. I thought that it was like a jump off. Like to where he understood that everybody would assume it was. And then it really became an indictment on the industry as a whole. And especially When, you get to the third verse, I feel like he's really shooting at like YouTubers and streamers and stuff like that.


Like, you know, kind of like buzzards picking at a carcass. you know what I'm saying? Like that was kind of how I processed like we'll get to the third verse. Yeah. But that was where, that was what really stood out in terms of the song For me I think That was a lot, a lot of that in there for sure. Yeah. I think it was bigger than hip hop. I think it was a like just our culture, you know what I'm saying? Like our urban society. I think he was, it was an indictment against that. More so than just even hip hop music in my opinion. And all of this tracks back to if You, if you really paid attention to like the, the Mr. Morale big steppers album. Like he's, you know, been kind of alluding at just being fed up with where the culture is.


So yeah, now I take out the spearhead, the, the, the biggest artist in the culture and now I'm getting address This shit. Kind of like what Joe was saying. Yeah. I don't, I absolutely love it. Hate to take all the air out the balloon so early. Wish I could have found a slower way to walk the dog. I absolutely love it. And I'm probably not going back to it much. I feel like this was an extension of six 16 in LA a little bit for me. Yeah. Musically. Sonically. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. I feel like if you hated six 16 in LA then you don't have a chance with this Falls in Meet the Grams also kind of, It has falls in that playlist.


See that's different. I totally agree with you. I totally agree with you because I love six 16 in LA is probably my favorite out of all of that. And I don't, you Don't see similarities sonically, I mean just, just a beat a little But. yeah, but I, my music profile of you is one with the chakras six 16 in LA has the tempo and, and the intensity, the drive sonically to get people like you with needs to be this if and this doesn't have that sonically musically. Yeah. It, I don't think this is going to get the people like you I think that when people are super, super, super lyrical like this and like Nas and like a few other people, the chakra people out there are like whack beat get outta here.


Some of the vocalists are choosing beats to highlight the vocals. And I think, I think this beat selection is ridiculous. Shout out, shout out to Ransom. This beat is crazy. If I had a complaint, this is a five minute, six minute joint at some point I too would've liked. This is When. you get in your like he did before it. Yeah. But this is, this is musically the beat Wise is this is a genre of loop drum list kinda loopy sound and shade. Even though they built around this loop beautifully Indiscreetly. Yeah. It it's not supposed to get bigger Also. No, you're right about that. This Feels like a freestyley kind of vibe, you know what I mean?


You're right, you're right about that. I'm off base historically. We get Preacher Kendrick before Mike Williams in The Wire comes out. Mm mm Before we see Omar, we get preacher time. He normally lead y'all with some type of message, some preachy rap rap. I want better for my people Untitled album Ish type of shit. And then head starts and then head start to roll. Well, You can hear that in this 'cause he had the line, he muted out damn near that. I have been trying for four days to piece together and I will continue to do so.


I'm not, I I haven't pieced it together. But somebody died there that shouldn't have died. Yeah. Yeah. Because the next four to eight bars and outplay, It is speaking expounding on that. But somebody, I feel like direct names were said and killed and I can't do that. So bleep that out. Other than that, I don't think we would get a bleep from him. One two, not mad at anybody that hates it. It is not your bag. Totally not mad at you. This is for underground rap heads. Essentially. It is not supposed to be for commercial. Yes. For the new audience that he gained from the beef, from Not, Like, Us. And the success that he had last year. This is back to the core, back to the backpack for me, for me, this is the 30 minutes that the pastor does at a black church after the climax and the organ stop.


Mm. Okay. I see what you're saying. Okay. He's saying some shit, but he just went up. This is the come down. There's a message here. We need to hear it. It's rude for us to get up and walk out right now. So, and he killed the whole sermon. So let me, I'll stay, I'll stay. That was what I thought. I saw somebody on Twitter express it even better. I wish I could remember your name homeboy to give you the credit. But somebody on Twitter said this music sounds like the credits in the mob in the mob movie when each member goes to live their individual life and either ends up dead or in jail or the feds come or whacked.


And then we get the script on screen telling us about the rest of their story. And When I saw it, they peered this music with with that exact scene. And I said he smoked that. Damn, he smoked that. Also, the matter in which it release tells me that it's not intended to be for a bigger audience. You just put it on Instagram with some fucking Air Force ones. Like this is just, this is freestyle vibes to be almost that, that's a step above freestyle. That's what I was really hung up on the most. 'cause everything with Kendrick is intentional. It's, it's a, a meaning behind it. It's a reason for it. There's no leak, there's no, oh, this just happened.


We, we did this right now for this reason. So I always get to try to get into the, why is this happening right now? I mean, the only thing I knew was it was happening during the VMAs. And I'm like, is is there something there? You try to step on that like, See I don I don. I don't, I don't know Don don't think don don't think it's that deep this time. Only because we have our Super Bowl announcement. So now we can reverse engineers, consumers. The Super Bowl is in February. September's moving fast. So let's say his, his team, his trusted team is starting with October. We already know that they got a record that they're gonna put a lot of money behind.


'cause I heard a piece of it in front of that Not Like Us shit. You would be a fool to not put money behind that record. You gotta think that you'll give that record four to six weeks to try to get some type of momentum going before the Super Bowl. Right? So now at this point I can tease, I can, I can play, I also still have Not Like Us as a top five record. I don't wanna drop anything that might disturb that. Still not yet. Not until we are ready with our next record and our our next campaign. And Being this song is kind of sonically the antithesis of Not Like Us. This is kind of like a, oh this was fire. Lemme go back to listen to that old shit. This song made me go back to the OBI went back to six 10 LA I went back to euphoria.


I went back to the family. Slow shit. Meet the grams. Meet the Grams. And I went back to Not Like Us and brought myself back to my first time hearing Not Like Us. That record for me is shooting up and where it's gonna land all time in dis records. High, very high. Like listening to it now with hindsight, right? That was in, that was incredible. I also saw, again, I saw all the tiktoks doing breakdowns. They're way too long for me to play here. But I wanna read this from a woman named Mimi, the music blogger. 'cause I thought this was dead on as well after I saw my TikTok shit. Watch the Party Die by Kendrick It is so Moses coded. And I love how shameless Kendrick is about God.


I don't wanna say crazy. Re I I don't wanna say crazy. Recently I've been trying to take my faith a bit more seriously. So probably explain my thought process. And recently been been revisiting the story of Moses When. I mean biblical. I instantly think about Exodus 32. There's a clear mirror between Kendrick's feelings about the current culture and the Israelites betrayal, Moses's fury and the consequences of abandoning faith for word play. Wordly temptations after God. She continues, I can see that parallel. There's video to back this up. That's fire. The, the video. Damn. I wish I knew Homeboy's name was just playing off. How this is untitled because It is meant as an extension of some of the story from an untitled.


See, I would have to toss to y'all because y'all know Untitled is not my favorite project. Me either. I I never really go back to that one. But apparently this whole story of Moses thing, he said a lot, he did a lot on untitled. Go back and on the new one, he's using words to reference him as the person seeing the future and telling the people what needs to be done. Destroy the whole shit. Put it back together. I can find the clips. But that's for the book people. That's for the book people as a slap. I I'm not mad at nobody saying they're not coming back to this For the people that love food for the soul, food for thought deeper meaning, you know, all of that shit.


It is there too. don don't think Kendrick is dropping an album about without, without tar, without hitting everybody. True. So everybody, everybody just gotta take their turn. Wait your turn. Something is coming. If you like Bob Kendrick, something is coming. I also don't think that he's done. No, no. There was, there was rumblings about a record, a second track dropping or another joint dropping. I'm not here to confirm or deny, but there's a bunch of us out there that don't think he's done. I thought he would look out again, drop a little something before we started recording. But I just like Me not be greedy. I ain't gonna hold you. I just like the fact that we still ain't heard a peep from this nigga, Or We have not heard of Peep from Kendrick.


He just posts a link. I like the, I like the Instagram that I love YouTube drop too. I think it's, it's a, a fly new take on the mixtape. Like let's, let's put out something, see if people like it or not. And maybe we'll decide later to put it out or not. Here, just toss It out there. Digest it. I like it. I like, I just like the fact that he's not doing anything extra. Yeah. You know what I mean? You don't see him everywhere. You don't, he's not posting all over the place. I am literally just getting to the point. Yep. I said everything I need to say right here. It is, you don't need a tweet. I don't need a tweet. Put that niggas on Slauson gathering 10,000 ninjas for the Super Bowl. Y'all watch this.


Y'all watch this. All y'all little Wayne should have been there. People Yeah, I know. I Got it. Watch this though. He about to put on a performance. Yeah. I went back and watched a movie, his very short performance from the last Super Bowl. Yeah. And the Dr. Drake. And I'm pretty sure after that I came on the pod and said, damn, I would've loved to hear more and see more of that. You know what y'all gotta watch? Yo, it's on Amazon. I watched it. You Watched it. What? There's the, the Kendrick show, the live tour I. think that went in Paris. It was in another country or something. Yeah, it was in Paris. Okay. But it's Kendrick Lamar live. It's the, the the big steppers tour. But it's like a two hour show masterclass in in performance masterclass.


Okay. Like if you got some time, just give it a watch. You'll understand. I tweeted that. I said, yo, just go watch this and y'all will understand. I don't think we've seen the last of Omar from the wire. Rest in peace. Mike Williams. I miss you. I love you and I think about you each and every day. Back to this did Cop please gimme peace. Did God please keep this la niggas away from me? Did God keep me shining? The fuck? Do they really think pocket watching? You must be the police. Hey God bless these words. Yeah. Pocket watching. Y'all must be the police. Don't be the police. Yo. How hard I Try. You don't have to live like that. I think it's time for me to watch the party die.


Get we die, send home, we go watch the party die. This hook is reminded me of anytime I've been in the club and a nigga just started shooting while I was in there Trying To get away. Slow motion. Yo, why would you do that right now? Yo kill Bill shit. Yeah. Big go. I think it's time to watch the party die street niggas in the corporate guys, the rappers that report the lies. I they families mortified all of us. We could do life without them. Get their bodies organized. Tell me if you obliged no more pillow talking jump starting neighborhood walls, dirty macing bitches because your spirit is insecure crashing nigga with nasty decisions using money as a backbone.


I want his head cracked before he's back home. That was crazy. Hates all of us. He hates each and every last one of us who think he's Referring To. And everything that we are doing Sounded disgusted As a whole. Mm. It wasn't just Drake. There's only one nigga. He is disgusted. Yeah, he's really, There's only one nigga we've been complaining about that we've been saying it's fucking niggas, bitches. It's another reason. Like there's only one person that we, we've been saying he's going after niggas girls and doing that and that and that was Drake. So when he said that line, it also, I'm like, like, Oh you determined to make this about Drake. No, I wasn't determined. I'm just saying like, you know, up here we come up with a lot of theories and, and a lot of times your theories land.


So if we saying a man is out here intentionally nailing niggas, women and the nigga say you dirty Mac and to bitch. you Know I also like that about this song is that It is kind of a bridge in that way of coming off the dis records and then hyper analyzing lyrics to find out what who he's talking about and why he's talking about it. You too. And he's not. But it kind of gives you little tastes of maybe he's talking about someone. So it's a good bridge to go into. No, I'm not talking about nobody at all. I'm just rapping. I'm just giving him benefit of the doubt man. you Know? Yeah. He said he was You. right. He said he was gonna be direct and got And was direct and Got super direct. So now I for you for that same Person, I gotta come at his word to Turn around and be very indirect.


I just, But I'm with you. I like the puzzle of it. Yeah. I like it's Art. That's art. That's really what art is. Interpretation. Listen to it, watch it, read it. Whatever type of art It is and what do you take from it? What do you think this means? Start the conversation. So it's art. Yo 10 extra bonus lives for the rapper. That sets it on this nigga. I'm telling you, I know some of y'all are home trying to think of fucking rollout plans and ways to engagement for him. I know y'all are 'cause I know y'all nasty ass brains. One of y'all is thinking about just setting it on this nigga, but he looked too powerful right now. He looked too strong. See the problem. So you didn't do it. The problem is the ones That would do it. He ain't even respond.


He Cool with him? No, he not gonna respond to them. The ones we talking about, we would want to see do it ain't gonna do it Don don't think that. I don't think he need to respond for you to get the 10 extra bonus lives either. I think if a rapper that's nice enough, step out there and kick this karate kid nigga head off. Rest in peace to do from the karate kid he passed away also. Ooh, Google it. Which one? There's only two people in Karate kid. Mr. Miyagi. No, Google it. So I don't On air. Chad McQueen. Thank You Jesus Ion Joseph. What role did he play? The pressure Ish?


We didn't write the Karate kid. He was the blonde kid. Oh, Johnny. Yeah. Any who? Steve Mc. No he wasn't. No he wasn't. No he wasn't. He wasn't Johnny. This nigga It is. Oh yeah. Anyway, Bobby, he played Dutch. Nobody's gonna set it on him. So let me not waste anybody's time. But boy you lucky way back in the day. Somebody, somebody would've tried it. Oh well it's different. Back then Somebody would stand up here With your chest down like this. Niggas would've you put the target on yourself. Shit. That's the only reason I jumped on that control beat. But The problem is Every rapper jumped on it. I ain't feel like it needed me, but nah, you ain't just gonna talk to us like that. I I think a lot of the, the Spitters That would be capable of doing anything.


Agree with a lot of the shit that he's saying too. Well That's true. I agree with that. That's true. That's why it's like, I'm not yo dog. Kendrick did what he had to do in the battle. I think post battle ain't really about that. I am a fan. This is my second favorite version of Kendrick Lamar. It seems like with this era that he's going in of just looking at all of us and saying, ha, He you disgust Fucking pea. I think debut Kendrick is my, is my favorite Kendrick in hindsight. Because you got your whole life to make your debut. And he did that with that. I, I can't. He did, he changed the game with that shit he did for me, for me, for me, for me. But this, this Kendrick in my forties.


I'm fucking with this disgusted nigga. He is disgusted at us Media, everything. Yo. And I'm disgusted too with you niggas that are blatantly and overtly posturing hoping to get a favor in return. I am. It ain't just Kendrick. He named some shit that he mad at. I, I too sit home disgusted about it. Just nobody cares. Well you could tell boy anyway, anyway. 'cause if I keep going I'll heat up Begging, begging for the, Here's my question y'all. I'm gonna keep playing this actually I'll keep playing it. First time Radio personality propaganda for Even that like the production. Like that's the only time you hear that little base undertone right there.


Bring it back. Lemme bring it back. Shit Around this insecure, the flashy nigga with nasty decision. Here we go. Has a backbone. I want his head cracked before he's back home. The radio personality casualty. It seems Like It is a simple loop, but they're doing mad shit Within this little simple loop. They're building this, they built this Work. Let's kill the followers that follow up from the ivy felon to acknowledge the hope that we trying to spread. And if I'm not his, then you need to bring his fucking head or film that shit in high God gimme life. I know Jill Scott heard this and went crazy.

Dear God, please forgive me. you know how hard I tried. Hey, I think it's time for me to watch the party die sometimes I wonder what Lecrae would do. Fuck these niggas up or show 'em just what prayer do I wanna be empathetic my heart like D one. But I will, It's total. Okay. I'm trying to think of what I'm trying to figure. I've been thinking of it for a minute. Whatever it was, it was, I have an idea.


I got one. I do have an idea of who died along with somebody else. I think more than one person died in that bar. I think one person died, but somebody watched them die in that bar. I see what you're saying. Sun would fit perfectly in that run scheme. All right. come on Guys. Sun. Yeah. Sun is in there And mine, mine too. And mine's son is in there. Who mine is in there. And When I, think of what he's saying on This shit and how it somehow magically mirrors exactly what seems to be going on in the music industry.


I am putting that bar that y'all hear right now that we can't say in there. And that's hard. And you can't say that. You gotta take it out. Can you stop and tell us? I'm not telling you nothing Why it's over What dog nigga you Told us last time, why you, why you get like this Man? Because all during, all during the back and forth, one of the greatest beefs they ever had, all during the back and forth, I was home hurt while you were doing your reaction bids And I was making money off you, You made a lot of money. I felt like, but I couldn't prove it that some of that was a little bit of my sauce.


You said that you felt that way, but IIII don't agree. I know, but there was no way for me to prove it. So the only way, But there is a way for you to prove the Put meal. So the only way to change it forever is to kick you out the kitchen when the sauce is, I can't give you too, all you Gotta do is stop this and like, oh fuck, This is what he said. No. 'cause then you gonna go to YouTube and make a lot of money off of what I'm saying. You said yes. You don't do that no more. Didn't say anything. You said Yes bro. I don. No, you don't do that no more. That's like when the corporate companies call and be like, Hey Joe, tell us what you think It is like some so, oh, I fell For that before. Yeah. Oh Man. Yeah. Yeah. It's a trick. Yeah, it's a trick. You have to know to not fall for Hey, I'm just calling to run this by you. Get your thoughts on, get your thought, What you think.


How we could do this. Yeah. Your thoughts is about to change the enterprise. You Get the talking. Yo what you could do is You will go to YouTube and be deemed a music scientist. If I gave this to you, they would look at you like the rapy rap genius. If I gave this to you, all of the comments would be applauding you Flip markman. All of The comments would be bigging you up while I would be at home with the tight face saying, Listen nigga, I did that. You you going, you going bro, you going to cash him out something? Nah, I'm not. No. He never cashes me out. Oh damn. And we have a topic about cashing out your friends later. Yeah, yeah. We do have a topic about. I'm not gonna do that though, but I, I will tell you I'm talking shit right now.


I will tell you off air at some point. But I'm putting somebody in there so that somebody has to be powerful enough for you to take their name out of this. Mm. Writing's right there on the wall. But anyw. Who? Anywho. I ain't fucking with them niggas. Hey, the best thing I ever did was get out the music business. I'm not gonna lie. Not to discourage anyone, but I'm so happy with my decision even though Parks won't fucking hit the remaster on some of my shit. So we can make some money. I got you man. I got you man. I got you. That's how you know he too up. He too up. I love That. That's the la version of Yo, Let's do lunch. I got you. Yo, we we do lunch. He got me with my music. Gimme that hard drive. Oh, Hit play. I got 90 seconds left for this.


We get These devils out the way. Heavy metals on my sword. We settle hard disputes today. The ghetto Hollywood divorce. Say hello to your future fate. The coach of bread with Con Forge. You let 'em snack, they eat your face. The signatures is being forged. They, I'm not ented to drop. The more visible you get, the more, Oh boy did he connect with my soul Right there word. He connected with my soul. I gotta cock that back right there. And y'all wonder why I'm not enthused to drop. Every time you play the game, some of your spiritual gets robbed. Whatever the hell he said. Lemme hear. The more visible Wonder why I'm not ented to drop. The more visible you get, the more your spiritual is tried.


Super. Come on dog. He's right. What's more visible than the Super Bowl? But I'm still not. But look, but I'm still not dropping frequently. So even if I drop periodically and just go to the Super Bowl, I could still run back to my rabbit hole. I'm not putting out an album every single year. Who better to tell you about what it does to your spirit than someone that's about to do Fucking super Stop It. Freeze. Don't do that. Look it. Freeze. Why Don't do that? Why He trying? No, he talking about me. Stop it free. Don't, don't do that. You searching for that contrarian branch. I'm not you searching just because I don't Nicole to say know these artists. Petrified the end result Jail by Jezebel. Drug lies critical.


you know my physical is tested all the time as I'm pushing out feelings, feelings. When, I. Nigga wonder what Lecrae would do. Yo, if Kanye could still rap like Kanye raps. My God. Yeah. Boy. He would destroy this with what he's going through and what he got going on. Go crazy. Huh? Him and inside would go crazy. Oh man. Said I gotta burn it down to build it up. That confirmation will as fuck. It ain't too many Willis us locking into what I trust looking outside the kids live tomorrow. 'cause today the party just, Yeah, let the B Rock on the nigga Kendrick.


Hey, I love that shit. It still salute to Kendrick for me. He needs help. He is sick in the head. No, he think we need help. He's sick. But, but we all, that's really what It is. He thinks he is looking at All of us like He is. There's no Helping you niggas at this point. We just gotta burn all This shit down. I gotta get my hug from that nigga before he hates us too much. He is disgusted with us. Everything. He just all every, everybody, everything. Everything. Everybody. My pen, everything. I feel it. He ain't fucking with none of that shit that we be doing. I Feel Sorry.


And I like that Ransom already grabbed the beat and did his thing on it. Like Big ran Big Jersey. Big Jersey. Yeah. Big Jersey ran. Definitely sounds like a Ransom. It is not like Ransom. Nick Craven cooked that up. Yeah. 100%. Let me ask y'all something I saw as soon as the last pod ended, I saw all this talk about people discussing whether they think he would be performing Not Like Us at the Super Bowl. I don't, why would that even be a question? It's definitely a question. I don't think the lyrics are gonna be performed. Absolutely. It's a thousand percent question. The song is happening. I could see him doing the third verse. The song is happening and he's gonna bring out like a big band. A-A-A-H-B-C-U band. That's what I thought. Southern.


Hmm. Southern Grambling. One of the schools from Louisiana. 'cause you want to give, especially with the critique of somebody from Louisiana not being present, you would probably go grab one of those schools. However, the lyrics in that song definitely pose a problem for the biggest ad dollar day in the of the year. If he gets one of 'em verses off, he's a g So I think he'll modify. Shut up, give it to me. These niggas When I get the bro Some dude on Twitter This Shit.


Yeah. That live band is gonna kill us. Yeah. I think I'll find a way to Would Not Like Us to do some shit like this. Some super edit shit where he gets off the acceptable parts of the verse Or he could just modify the song. He can modify the song and get only missing one other Bite He Hold he nigga. Yeah. With the fireworks. Hey, there's a part we missing in there too. He could really hate this nigga enough that I want to get the verse out there. Listen, don don't know why this is a question.


Joe Button is here to tell you guys 100% like that. I mean, Not Like Us is coming on during the Super Bowl and Like that. No, like that too. But Not Like Us is coming on. I'm not sure that he included Drake's name in the Amazon version of Not. Like Us. There was a Is that me? Oh yeah, I'm, I'm not sure that he said Drake's name in that version. There's a few lines that have to be altered to get this off. But there is nothing flagrant about trying to strike a chord. And it's probably a that's happening. And that whole building in New Orleans is going to say it and it's gonna be 7,000 instruments on the field doing the live version of Not Like Us.


I don't know why this is a debate. It's happening. Hey, this is what got him the call. This is why he rewind that song 90 times at the Amazon performance. Oh, the Pop out. Yeah. Yeah. It is not by nothing at this juncture is by coincidence. That song is coming on. And I agree with some people out there. Hey, Drake may try to send some paperwork to stop it, but I ain't saying your name. I'm not saying the word pedophile and the whole world knows what this song is and what it's about. And I think he did say that on the Pop-out show. He said his name. I'm not certain. I know if bro, it's that song was edited some on that Pop-out show.


Listen man, the hatred dude got this is what I take from it. I really don't like you. Yeah, you don't like him. So. I might use the biggest stage in the World. No. Might To continue to shitless not showing You. It's not a might. It's not his choice. It's no might about it. This is happening. It's Not his choice. All of those decisions will be made by somebody higher up than him. Now whether they rock with it or not, that's not his choice. They're rocking with it. We'll see that song. I think that record is coming on buddy. Hey, brace yourself if you don't want hear none of that. Get record ready. So You don't think the record comes on at all tonight? No, I think, I think they'll modify. I don't think they'll start talking about no pedophilia and all that other stuff.


Oh, I agree with that. On, on tv. I agree with that. On the biggest fucking, again, the biggest ad day of the year is the Super Bowl. Yeah, I agree With that. don don't, And the powers that be are going to hear it. Don't Let him before We up there and talk About somebody don tons of rehearsal. That's what I'm saying. So yeah, This will be approved before He, he already had, he already sent him the clean script. Possibly somebody read this. He gonna have the So you think he can do a la last minute like adjustment? Nah, It would be nothing last minute. Mm. All of he's no that Recorded. He's not Kanye. No, he he's not Kanye. That shit's prerecorded also. So there's only so much he can do to freestyle up there. Anyway, Shout to Kanye and his people. They, they invited me to Japan to China to watch him perform.


Oh yeah. Okay. Okay. You Gonna go? No. Really? Yeah. Why not? Is it the length of flight? That Is the truth. I haven't taken a vacation all year. You've taken nine. I have not. That is lies. Andre, when is the I'm shooting at you. When did they invite? He saved you. But When? When did they, like what month is it? It is Sunday. Oh, Sunday. Oh. Oh. Okay. That's different. I think to my knowledge, doing two dates out there Sunday. I'm don don't remember the second one. Both of which I'm not here. I'm gone. Okay. I Thought it was like in the future. Yeah. I thought it was like in the future you would've, you would went if you had the days.


No, like October, November you would've went if you had the days. Who knows. The world will never know. He'll, He'll invite you again. He gonna hear this like, oh you busy? All right, cool. Next time we gonna invite him to Switzerland. He's still doing dates, Something's going on. I Would absolutely love to see one of them shows he's playing. Yeah bro. 500 Slaps. You would go to China? Yeah. Fuck yeah. Went a pj. Yes. On a PJ For sure. For sure. On a, not on a n. pj. Talking about nigga y'all are birds though. Y'all. Y'all lucky I'm not coming back in the afterlife as A-W-N-B-A play. I trick y'all out your drawers boy.


I get y'all right on a plane. Short dunk on short. You be getting dunked on. I get you right on a plane. Alright. Yeah, not a problem. Come box me out baby. Come box me out baby my nigga. That's racist somehow. What else? What else? What else? What else do we have on this kid? Drop? Oh no, I was gonna say off of that, You can go to Wayne's video. Yeah, I mean I mean it makes sense right here, Wayne. Wayne put a clip out. Wayne, get his ass kicked online right now. I'm, I'm not sure why. Set y alarm most playing. Dissect it. I didn't set y'all up.


You did, you did. You did, did I'm, I'm searching for the right way to say, shut up one second. I'm like, alright. Nah, I learned mute up girl. Hey, Wayne is getting destroyed online and I have absolutely no idea. Why Go? Could you tell me and the No, I'm gonna, I'm looking for a clip one. People We're station about a note. What taking place? What? What the Hell was that? Oh, that was me. I'm sorry. He's getting destroyed because men aren't allowed to be vulnerable and express themselves online. So could you tell what happened? Remix. Tell what happened? Tell the people what happened. Oh, Wayne put a video out. I Got it. Oh, you Got it. Okay. It Held me up When in response to the Super Bowl snub.


That hurt, hurt a lot. you know what I'm talking about? I hurt a whole lot. I blame myself for not being mentally prepared for a let down and Lost me right there. Yeah. For just automatically mentally putting myself in that position. Like somebody told me. That was my position. Facts myself, spending money before you get it. But I thought that was nothing. you know, I thought that was nothing better than that. That best spot in that stage, in that platform in my city. And So I hurt. I heard a whole lot.


But y'all, y'all are fucking amazing. It made me feel like shit. Not getting this, this opportunity and When I felt like shit. You guys reminded me that I felt Better. you know, y'all nigga shit on Kendrick saying shit have been me. That made me feel good. That's what he really meant. That's an amazing reality. So like I said, it broke me and broke. I'm just trying to put me back together. Wait. Oh, come on God.


How you all help me? Thanks to all my peers, my friends, my family, my homies on a sports television and everybody repping me. I really appreciate that. I really do. I feel like I let all of y'all down by not getting that opportunity but working on me. Alright. Dog. Distinguished. Cast. Tossing it to y'all. Slew to Wayne, first and foremost. And I'm sorry that he's disappointed, but it does come across as weaponizing the fan base on some They were right for being this upset.


Yeah. 'cause he didn't say I'm sorry that I wasn't mentally prepared enough to do the Super Bowl. Right. He said, I'm sorry I wasn't mentally prepared for them to reject me doing the Super Bowl. Yeah. I'm sorry. I didn't do more to make sure that my visibility and stock was up leading up to this event. None of that type shit. Like There, there's a, there's a, a clip, Jacob, York, you know, Jacob, Jacob, York. I don't put it out. And he Cory know him. Yeah, Corey know him. He was basically kind of almost say, this was when the announcement first happened, he was blaming Wayne's new engineer slash manager because he was like, it almost comes off like you just assumed it was gonna be you.


Like it did. You have to be pitched. You have to, you have to have, you have to. This is business. Yeah. You gotta pop. So you have to talk to them and, and show them, Hey look, this is why I should do it. I have this, this, this, these are the numbers. This is what would happen because of this. He was like, I'm pretty sure your old managers and he ran down the names, the names that we were mentioning before knows that Of course they know that and would've been on top of that to get you in that conversation. Even in the conversation. They know That I'm telling you know that. But now listening to Wayne, it almost backs up everything he said. 'cause he's like, I just assumed that it was going to be me. Why? What does that have to do with management?


Because management are the ones who do it. I don't, I I don't know. Correct me. I could be wrong. It ain't an interview. They Pick. Yes. It is. Yes. It is, they pick who they want. Natural. That's not No, it's an interview. Natural. It's an interview. So you think before Usher got the phone call that he was on a Super Bowl, he and Bruno Mars Tail Swift. Yes. Whoever, yes. Interviewed absolutely Yes. at the Super Bowl panel. Absolutely. Yes. And they didn't, or their people contacted. They Had enough resume building in the year before that they wanted to be on there. It is On the Radar. The Super Bowl is the reason that Usher went and took a residency in Vegas for two years in preparation for Super Bowl in Vegas and did all the, that's exactly why that happens. People, His girlfriends and shit to fucking bring visibility To this and, and paid the social media team to make it as a big event every week.


That is why that happened. He interviewed people interview. You need to be pitched. That is not your job as an artist. No. You should not have to worry about that. You should be free to go create, be innovative, be seen, perform, shake hands, kiss kiss babies, get on your campaign trail, your managers, your handlers, your business people that have to go, come up with the, the one to two year plan to make you make it make sense on The radar. You are saying that you think Usher Raymond took a residency, I Don't think In Las Vegas, which totally revived his career for the sole purpose of getting a Super Bowl gig. Not the sole purpose, The sole Purpose, but it was definitely Part of the plan.


80%. 80% Usher was ready to get the fuck outta there long before he got the fuck outta here. Yes. That's possible. Yes. That residency was great for him. He extended those dates and continued to extend those dates and people that was coming to the, It's just part of the plan. He's saying that it's like a, a very, Wait, hold off for a second. Not that bad was coming. Usher is taking that same show that I went to see to the Barclays and the arenas now to make sure that that bag is coming. When I went to the Usher show Usher and a 5,000 seater and a 6,000 seater. Don't really, that don't do nothing. That does absolutely nothing.


Usher just sold out back Toback nights at the Barclay. If anybody's confused about who Usher is. Usher is doing a 6,000 seater every weekend because he's positioning himself for something. That's the work ethic that it takes to do the Super Bowl. Wayne has not done any of that. With respect to Wayne, y'all, I wanna say everything I say with Wayne is with the utmost respect for me. He is solidified. He's one of the ghost. He's certified. Absolutely. He gave me a verse for free. I have nothing negative to say and shot a video. I have nothing negative to say about Wayne and Wayne how I met him and know him nothing but a standup nigga.


With that said, that was some years ago. I cannot speak to current day Wayne. Well, I I think to your point, it's, it falls really more on his handlers and team than him personally. Well, well Although that Yes, Both. Well, yes. Let me give this show. Oh, go ahead. Yes it does. I agree with that. Normally, and I don't know nothing about his situation. Normally when niggas get to firing everybody that's been there for their whole career, it says that they wanna do what the fuck they wanna do. Yeah. So, I need to find somebody that will be able to conduct my business and let me do what the fuck I want to do. Do know what that role also sounds like?


The engineer. The engineer. Yep. An enabler. Sounds like the engineer. Yeah. I don't wanna say enabler. He even, he could wanna do the right thing. He's not equipped for this stage. He's not equipped for megastar Wayne. Not without help, right? Not without help. Nobody is without help. No, you need a team. You need a team. One person don't deal with none of the mega stars. Not Hov, not m nobody, not B, not whoever you name. Shit. We see people come up here with fucking 16 people Team. And you know what time It is when that happens? We tease 'em all the time. A lot of money. Budget. As the money goes up, the number of people, the level of importance or the ability to do the job goes up.


That's not the engineer. That's with all due respect. Fabian, right? Fabian's name. Yeah. Fabian. Yeah. Yeah. With all due respect. With all due respect. Not to say that you won't learn in real time on a job and get better, but for Super Bowl time, that wasn't the tenure to fire Whoever the fuck got fired, it wa it. Well There was also a lot of bad business that happened with him pretty publicly. So that may have been the impetus behind him firing his whole team and finding someone that he trusts on a different level. So Yeah, listen above my pay grade. Sure. I have no idea what's going on behind some of these walls. This is all speculative. And to my point about not knowing whether or not he'd be willing to share the stage with some people at the Super Bowl, did y'all see that clip too?


You like is it bringing people out? What, what makes your halftime show so special? Please do not wear the camera. Please do not feel disrespected if you are an artist from New Orleans. An artist tied to me in any kind of way in the music. But no, that's my moment and I earned that moment. So no, I'm not bringing Joe right here. You I'm talking about I'm singing and you sent it. I'm singing all the hooks that you made. You wrote, I'm singing them. Bobby Valentino, all y'all. I'm singing. I'm Sorry and I'm not mad at this. Oh, what I don Dunno if I would do it for the Super Bowl. But It is all sound like counting the money before it's in the bank. That's all It is.


And It is Fabian's job to manage expectations. Yeah. That's the manager's job. Also. Listen No's getting a Super Bowl gig with the, with the engineer manager. Respectfully. That's what I'm saying. Even that's no dis There's no disc. It's not a dis To him. It's no Dis It's not a dis to him. It's not a dis to Wayne. It just seem like the person you got handling you right now don't even know Wayne. You know, should have been out. You should be outside. You should be on residencies. You should be on newsletters. You should be visible. You should be at the colleges. You should be, you know who you should be. You should be LL Cool J for the last five, five months. don don't know if anybody's noticed.


No, he's everywhere. He's, I watched, I watched the MTV Music awards, some of them and LL absolutely killed the Killed Performance. We'll talk about it later, but I'm watching that shit also. I seen the him and M video finally. Listen dog. Listen dog. I'm late on that 'cause I didn't hear, but God damn what I'm saying is LL Cool J has been everywhere in front of everybody. Smiling, kissing babies, sharing his story, shaking hands, reinventing himself, reintroducing himself. That is what it takes. But you know what else ll been doing? Working out. Yeah. Creatine. He been Doing Fucking Niggas Up. He Been letting you know this is Rapper ll you know what I'm saying?


It is almost like you said reintroducing because there's a lot of people that don't know that that's the rapper. Yeah. You get what I'm saying? you know the actor. Yeah. They Know the actor. They know. I think, I think he kind of got him on that record. That's my attitude. I also think M let him but watch that video and listen to it again. I heard I Gotta listen To it again. Just listen to it. I'm listen, it was my first time seeing it. I didn't watch the video. I've heard the song I saw. Listen To that. See I never heard, I never heard M1 Song M's. Parts were, I think m let him, but even that's courteous. I just Don't see it's l You see L fucking pouring his heart out on that fucking microphone. I ain't, it ain't from that. don don't see M letting nobody.


Oh I do. I do. Anyway, that's what Wayne should have been doing for the last I agree. Year and change campaigning. And I know this was on your mind because we have all these interviews of you talking about the Super Bowl in New Orleans because It was a no brainer to them. And that's like I said right after the last let's, let's call it what It is. Yes. Right after the last Super Bowl when they said next year is New Orleans, That's when it should've started. You Immediately saw, oh they gotta get Wayne. Alright if not Wayne, because again, the question was, well Wayne ain't really not saying he's not, hasn't been active 'cause he's been feature active but he hasn't dropped a project.


He hasn't dropped a, I think he did a little EP or something, but he's not the way we knew him to be. Yeah. So then it was like, okay we gonna do Y-M-C-M-B. This is what everyone's already assuming and I think he bought into them assumptions as well. Yeah, but see that's what I'm saying and that's a Mistake. It It is a mistake for Wayne to not do Carter three anniversaries the way that Nas and Hove do for Illmatic and Reasonable Doubt the way Jeezy did. Anybody with one of those albums does this. He Did the tour, which was welcome to the Carter where he was doing the Carter one, two, and three I believe. But even that, 'cause I went to one of those dates the night I came in here and told y'all it was amazing.


And I don't think they finished the tour. I think he stopped it or something. Something happened. If I'm not mistaken, I can, The manager needs to go call Live Nation or any of the touring venue places, whoever set the usher shit up and say Hey I need 5,000 cedar venues the same way that Usher did Hulu Theater, Madison Square Garden, five, 6,000 people doing it for A week Straight. Bringing every fucking star in the world that go do that everywhere. Show that you have the breath control to do this stamina, the stamina to do this. Show that you're healthy enough, the projection, your voice, your mobile enough, the consistency show, show the people who don't understand our culture.


'cause that's what this is. That's just looking at numbers. And you unfortunately have to go against the nigga who just came off of the highest selling hip hop tour in the history of rap. Like who you asking them to put you there instead of their resume this year they kicked ass, their resume kicked some ass this year. And bro, I mean I get it. Y'all, y'all are doing this whole, he's from New Orleans, you know, because of the LA thing where they had La Snoop and Dre and all of that dog put the work in. You could still get a Super Bowl. See I think behaving this way is gonna turn them off. you know? Wrong that, that's where I think, I think it fucks up or could have another effect. What it could, if you get enough pity, if you get enough press that says yo, he got snubbed, you still gotta, he could potentially be on the next year.


Still gotta do the work. Definitely gotta work. You still gotta do work. You do. You still have to do the work. I'm not disappointed. So that's what I'm saying. Take this as, you know. Alright. you know what, y'all overlooked me this year. Cool. I'm I'm gonna bust my ass and show y'all why Shit next year Super Bowl I think is in the Niners. San Francisco. San Francisco I believe. Okay. You don't have to be from New Orleans and do it there. I agree. Put the work in and go get next year. Get the year after. Like I just don't like, I don't like the video. I I really don't personally, I didn't like the video. I like silence from the mega stars. I I didn't like it. I didn't like seeing Wayne sit there and do that.


Once you transcend the genre, which I think Wayne is a part of, I think Wayne is on that list is what I'm saying. He is. It is silent time. It's silent night. That's it. There's no more of your emotions and how you feel. And let me tell you It is, It is no more gesturing and posturing for the strangers on the internet. That's the difference between the niggas that Got it and the niggas that don't. We don't care. You know why this we don't care. you know why it bother me? Not we like I'm near, but you know what I'm saying. Wayne don't do this. We don't hear from him no other time. That's why, that's why it bother. That's why it Looks a fucking way. That's why it away. And he was one of those who every time I'm feeling something I jump on and cut the camera on. I let you know what's going on then this will be right online and I'll be all right.


Cool. This is him. This is what he do. But when this is not you, it almost seemed like a pity party now. Like Right. Yeah. That's the part I didn't like it. I'm broken I don like That nigga. Yeah. Stop. Tell Fabian respectfully get With your squad and say all broken, how can we fix this? What we, what we gotta do so we can lock This shit down that Shit before you know my shit Lil Wayne's been through since 94. Yeah You are broken by This. It's a lot. Don't Start talking like mail. How fuck did I catch it Straight? Don't you know you getting a bucket? Oh my God. Decision land. Stop it. Stop it. Stop. How do you wear those socks? Stop right now. Oh.

Like the rest of us work Harder and I, I know that sounds fucked up but that's really Celebrate. Nah man, still Get it. Not talking to Wayne talking anybody that needs to hear this You can still get it though. Nor would I say this to Wayne because When you are managing superstars. Maybe you don't go to them and say this type of shit but Fabian needs to hear it. Somebody talked Wayne into doing that shit man. Wayne. Yeah, somebody talked.


Agree. I think it's No I Agree. It was a wrong move. It is Fabian. Yeah. I asked somebody, I I asked somebody, was there a chance that maybe Kendrick bring brings Wayne out just looking for a silver line? That's a, the answer is no. It's a dove for that. That would ruin too much and too much is already ruined. That would ruin too much think. Yeah. No I don't think It would ruin shit again. And that ties to it would ruin shit. Let's, let's say, let's say he don don't, let's, he was considering doing it right. We just heard dude from the Grammy say Yo, he don't show up for rehearsals. We've been, this has to go off without a hitch. So if you've got a reputation of not showing up for rehearsals, you pop up right before you scheduled to hit the stage, do your part and dip off. Like maybe somebody might say, you know what, I'm not gonna invite him on my set.


See that's what I meant by don. Don't know enough about current day Wayne to be able to vouch for whether or not those things are happening. But even if those, those things aren't happening, It is your job to address the rumors of those things happening. Even if they not happening. The fact that everybody think that about you It is time to go on the little back meeting tour at everywhere you need to go to in the conference room. I'm To bust some ass and show that you're Working. Yeah. Play some, play some slaps on the speaker. Say Yo, this is what I got coming. This is my vibe and yo I'm honored to be here. Thank you for having me. New artist shit again. New artist shit again. Listen, Shaka was in here with fucking Doshi the other day. Yeah they, they have no idea what that means but Shaka should not be on the fucking campaign trail.


Cole nar always wanna come up here. Hey nigga you come with 'em all you fucking 30, 30 year exec niggas get y'all assses back in the mix of things. That was Money Dollar. Huh? That was money loan. Okay. Shock. I can't hear you. That was money long. Chaco was Money loan. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But same day. Yeah same day. Same day, same day. you know that mention, listen Kendrick, looking forward to what you have next. Can't wait to see how you continue to reverse engineer your Super Bowl appearance with what you and your team think, think thinks needs to happen in that gap. How many? I still got 'em selling over 600,000 records. Nah, I wouldn't even ask you that. How many more drops you think we get before we get the album from Kick?


A Few more. You Got it, you gotta get drops. I'm just saying five ign look From now until February. Yeah, Yeah between between three and five. You got to, if you have a whole project and you're trying to sell your project and you have the Super Bowl and you have this, the next single that's coming and you'll want to do something around that. Even for the lowest of visible guys. He is, he is visibly low. What are we about to be in October? I'm gonna go four, four or five. It's five months to the Super Bowl. So I Don't think you'll give us one a Month even though. So y'all think his album does not come out prior to the Super Bowl? I think his album maybe prior to at first I no actually no.


No because the whole industry shut down from December to January. No he ain't dropping I don't think have him dropping before then. At first I thought no, no, but it's think so unorthodox as this nigga move. I think So I wouldn't be surprised. Yo. I wouldn't be shocked if you get a silent a secret drop somewhere. Would I bet my poker chips center table for that? No I'm not betting on that. I fold Got It. Yeah I just think Kendrick likes to do so much Unexpected. Somebody on the shit. I'm sorry somebody on the internet was like Drake dropped his dance album on Kendrick's birthday. So I'm guessing that Kendrick drops his album on Drake's birthday which is October 20, whatever I don the 24th I don. I don't buy it either but I really enjoy internet theories.


See I just think I got him doing the Usher I think. I think Kendrick is so unpredictable and he don't like I think that nigga. I just think he knows a lot of people are expecting that. I think the album done so because that I'm not dropping then. Well because of what's at stake. That's exactly why I'm dropping it then I want to maximize Usher did the right thing. But It is Usher not during his heyday. Right. So you're gonna see a hundred thousand, 150,000, 200,000 for somebody that does 300, 400. Somebody that has sniffed five and 600 before. I need to see what it looked like off my number one, off my fire second single while everybody is in they living room together at halftime.


I need to see it that same effect that everybody living room had when Beyonce did the Super Bowl. I need to see it for the hip hop niggas because now if I come out and I'm just, I'm just throwing shit at a wall. If Kendrick come out and do after Not, Like Us, I had him going over 500. He do that If he come out and Do, I was checking too if he sniffs Six 50 and 700, which we ain't been seeing without bundle packages and you know he's gonna do bundle packages and you know he is gonna do bundle packages. So you think that's contingent bun? You getting Some PG Lang Socks?


Yeah And T-shirts and a Frisbee and a lighter nigga He ain gonna play the game and if he do six, if he do anywhere between six and 700 day at the Super Bowl kiss the baby. Hold on, kiss the baby buddy. There's nothing else that nobody can say to him. Mr. Morale did what? Yeah, talk to him. This can't be right. Talk to him. Big freeze. No, No, no This shit say 1 77 this can't be right. That's Not right. It wasn't his highest but it didn't do 1 77. I'm pulling His highest I wanna say is damn. Yeah Damn is the one that did six plus.


Oh commercial performance first week 2 58 for Mr. Morale And that's on the humbug. Low low no momentum. We've covered that shit. Yeah, I'm Sorry 2 9 2 95 2 9 5. It wasn't no motion with that actual albums. Okay. The only motion he had was that hard part five shit. And the AI vid nigga he doing 600 Easy and then homeboy gotta go to bed. He gotta take a nap at that point or you gotta go set it on somebody else. Damn. Damn Did 600. Yeah man I remember that. That was, that was I got 'em. Yeah I got him breaking six 50 But.


yeah Dropping on the Super Bowl with bundle packages. I got 'em breaking six 50, maybe 700. So the Date is announced. The date So, I'm saying you have the date being announced. Not like Okay. And my album is out now. Oh no. Daon announced. Okay Dayon announced announce. Okay he gonna give the people time that need to save money to buy it. To buy it. The same way he sold the tickets in fucking LA to the metro. PCS niggas Got it. He gonna make sure everybody's covered 'cause that's how you sell 700. Yeah. Yeah I think with all of that I think he drops it prior to the Super Bowl. Like how far? How Far ahead Before maybe or something like that. What if he say an hour before the Super Bowl? No, I'm talking before. You mean like No end of November week. Oh end of November.


Oh you talking About week first week of December? Yeah. I think he don't necessarily subscribe to playing the games like that. Yeah, don don't think So, I don't think he care about it like that. And I think that he going to do numbers regardless off of the year that he's had. I I think that he don't need the Super Bowl to move 600. Yeah. But I think that there are also, It is probably some forces that play with the Super Bowl. That would make him not the Super Bowl people or the production teams or whatever maybe saying do not drop until after the Super Bowl. We don't want anything to come out. Say there's something on the album that's offensive that may get people in uproar or say the album isn't received. Well they don't wanna step on any of the hype to the Super Bowl. That's a great point. So. I, I see it coming. That's a great point.


Either the week right before or the week after or some shit like that. Or drops days at halftime This shit. Oh by the way the album's on your phone right now, Right? Right after the performance? Yeah, that that was a good point. The I could see he might Shoot at somebody. Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah. He might say something that some shit could offend some political connects. Kendrick Lamar, the universe is going to bring us together because you want that hug so bad because I believe in the power of the universe.

It didn't Look crazy, but it looked edible. Thank you. I looked edible. I'll take it. It we could leave all this Drake Kendrick stuff Y'all want to address the, the shit that they just debunked about Drake doing the Super Bowl off being offered to do the Super Bowl four times.


We can. I mean he, it came out a bunch of people were saying he is been offered the Super Bowl shit and a bunch Of people didn't say it, but it's okay. Okay. Roc Nation came out and said that's not true. It's a I was gonna say, and what a flat, Flat out lie or something. What would be the reasons for turning it down four times? Anybody would've brain heard that and said that that's not true. IIII heard it and I I I said there may, he may have been offered to like special guests with someone who was headlining and I could see that being No, I'm not gonna do that. I wanna do my own shit. I can see that. That I could see, that. I could see, but I, I didn't, I definitely did not believe he was offered to headline the Super Bowl four times or five or one time. Turned it down. That's not An unbelievable lie.


I don't Yeah, I don't think that Yes, It is unbelievable for him. For him to turn it down you mean? Yes. Yes. Not for the offer. No, no for him. Say no I don. I'm not doing So Got It Got it. Everything about this lie is unbelievable. Mm. Why? He's been one of the biggest artists in the world. I could see him be offered to do it, but I don't see him turning it down. That means what? To the NFL? It means that he's transcended all genres of people and it would be a great marketing thing to have him at doing Super Drake's Gonna Do a Super Bowl support. The NFL is the NFL. And if you turn us down the first time, we not doubling back the next three times to see if You want do See, I, that's not what I said. I said I think that the offer could have potentially been presented but offered four times. No, I didn't say that. I said the offer could have been presented to him. Oh man. Oh yeah. I'm not, I I I'm not against that.


Yeah, I'm not against that. The NFL is not doubling back. If you turn it down, you turn it down. Gotcha. You the end. You don't turn it down. For the most part, Homeboy ain't ain't get fucking more than one plus one at the Met Gala. Yet them companies that still think they them companies ain't looking at him the way all of us look at him. Sorry buddy. That just sounded, you know what I mean? And what you doing everything in the world to appeal to anybody that listens to anything out there that was, there's no evidence in the last few years of your career that you even at the point to turn down the Super Bowl, you just would do that outta arrogance.


And I'm me, I ain't, yeah, I'm in my bag. Nah, fuck outta here nigga. But no, he would do the Super Bowl if they called. He 100% do the Super Bowl and, and if they wanted him to do the Super Bowl, he would do the Super Bowl. And not just that because They would make it right As arrogant as he is, we'd have heard about it. He would've threw that in a verse somewhere or Something. He would've, especially when the hook is definitely told us as big as the Super Bowl, you and Cole. But I only got offered you the dope da da da. Yeah. He, he done threw that right in our face. Yeah. He, he definitely not to say that he won't never do it and don't have the catalog to do it. He 100% can do it. He should do it. Shout out to him. And that's the end of that Ish. I did want to double back to and re-listening to the pod and our dispute about, and then we'll leave this Drake stuff.


The Drake and fucking the girl had that little, that little dispute we had somebody from the community raised a good point I wanted to bring it to you with, with your take on that, where do you stand on you may a Doka and what he did, What did he do? Had sex. Sex Fuck on his wife. It wasn't the owner. It was one of the Executives from Boston. I I, I said this when we were going through it. I don't think he did nothing wrong with it. I think that, I think, as I said, yo When, you do shit like that. You gotta be willing to stand with the consequences that come with those actions. So as long as you are for You, If you fuck a dude's girl that you know be shooting niggas, be ready to go, you gotta be ready to deal what comes along with that.


Okay. You understand what I'm saying? So that, that's my thing. I think that where we started off is flipping myself. We're asking people, yo, why are we not looking at these women as if they've committed a a, an act? It is always the guy. If, if, if my girl gives you some pussy and you're not my friend, I don't hold any negative regard towards you at all. Associates included. I mean, I think it's levels to it. But. yeah. I I I think that we we are given too much onus and we are given too much. And you, and you and you When, you see the associate in the street that did that.


You dap him. Now you adding It is a new question. You advancing a conversation. It is a My Stance. I'm not trying to get y'all off. I'm not trying. My Stance is this, if I see a man and I hold a conversation with that man, I would never have sex with his girl because I don't want nobody ki keying in my face knowing that they fucking my girl. So I'm going to give him the same exact respect that I would want. But if I see You're down with me, what's So what you mean? If I see a nigga in the street and he be like, what up? And I'm like, what's up? Like I know his face. Why? you know what I mean? And I da and I'm gone. Yeah. Your chicks, she's on the table. Like I don't see, I don't, I think that's just okay.


I don't think it's a bad ruler thumb. Okay. More because if that's the case, everybody's lying because niggas out here is fucking niggas. Girls. That's true. Girls out here fucking niggas, dudes. So if, if everybody was living under this fake ass premise of yo, I would never, ever, ever, because they're married, then it, it wouldn't be no cheaters out here. No I think that that's happening. I just also think it's important to identify those people. It's a, it's a bigger majority than niggas will want to let on. I'm not here. It's more women out here cheating than they wanna let on. And it's more niggas out here cheating than we would let wanna let on. Yo, I'm 48 years old. You are 45. But I think that the, the the conversation. Watch your fucking mouth. How old you 45? you right. I'm asking 44.


You just turned 44. Yes. You, why don't you just turn, you were there. I thought he turned 40. No, that's no, he keeps saying he's got two years. Look to full maturity. Look at my face nigga. You say like, look old. I think The bigger conversation was that fucking people who you may potentially need for business purposes And So I think that their wives, Those Are maybe. And so even in that look, even in that, you gotta take what comes. Y'all might think Drake is gonna need this person down the line. He may not think that, he may not look at these people in the same regard that we look at them. I Just think, man, Cole I think that nigga's successful and that nigga's arrogant and he might not look at you like, nigga, I'm gonna need you for shit. You said, man, Cole. I i 100% believe in man Cole.


I'm saying that. What's the man Cole, what you just said. If I have extended conversation with you, I'm Not fucking Your girl. You're a high level associate of mine because you right. There's levels to being an associate then. I'm not. I You last, but I'm not pulling my toolbox out to try and fuck your girl. Even if I see her giving me the rhythm. Yeah, I agree with that. I think that's man code. I think that the same way girls got girl code. We got man code saying nobody shouldn't have break that. I think it's important to identify those people. Yeah. That's all I'm not saying, You know, and I know that It is niggas That have tried to fuck us. Fuck. And I'm like, yo, I ain't even going, yo. Yeah, I know your dude. Yeah. Like, yo, I be like, yo, she been ch for years.


Like just, I won't even leave the line of scrimmage. She throwing a ball at you for years. I'm like, yo, chill. Yeah. No Girls don't give a fuck. Stop flirting. Yo. Stop. Yo, stop. They Could see you with your girl nigga. Yeah. They don't, they don't do, what Are we talking about? Yeah, I'm not doing that. Like I'm, I'm not just out here fucking everybody's chick. Like I I don't think that shit is cool. I ain't I don't wanna shake your hand and then bust your chick. Be Kiki and yo in your car. Where this born So I was a kid. Huh? It is so, it's So hard. Suppressing my comedic genius. I have a perfectly timed joke. True. That fits right here. And I can't It hurts. It hurts. Why can't you? Why can't you? Because it's too perfect and beautiful and funny.


And You can fight me. Friendship is more important to me. But right in this spot he shot at you. What? I'm not looking at nobody. I'm just saying that it hurts to suppress your comedic, comedic genius on he just woo. Anyway. Look, he can't suppress it. So let's move on. No, I, I agree with it though. I'm not fucking niggas girls man. Because a nigga, if I know why I'm taking it, if I know a nigga he fuck my wife, I fuck a nigga girl. If don don't know you, yeah. I've done It once. When if your girl got dies, I did that shit One time.


Die is going years Ago. Like I'm talking about teenage years and I was cool with like Playing. Yeah, that's back in the day. I I'm gonna put it on her. I'm gonna tell you. She ain't tell me yo.

Got caught popping the dude chick and they fly and for Valentine's Day, Shirley was with both of them. So wait, come on. But the one dude was scared of the other dude. So when, when he called the girl and she was calling them babe and all this other shit. So then they hung up and the home, the, the boyfriend called her. He was like, yo, where you at? And she was like, like Publix or something.


He's like, yo, you in Publix right now? And he like, yeah. And, and he was like, yo, so where you was at on Valentine's Day? She was like, what you talking about? I was waiting for you da da da. He's like, yo, I'm with the nigga right now. If you lie again, I'm gonna smack the shit outta him. And the dude, The Dude moves over, the dude moves over, hid behind the other dude that was holding the phone and he was like, yo, I swear on everything I'm gonna kill you bitch. And then he was like, and I'm about to fuck him up. And the dude took off running and he chase the nigga and caught him and started fucking him up. You put yourself in that position knowing that you this close to the dude and you busting this chick and you can't beat him. And I will. And I and I will and I will say, I'm sitting here joking around and podding about fucking niggas girls at 44 years old.


I prefer not to fuck one of y'all's girl. It's over with. Yeah. Like my relationship. Women inside over. No, I watch the news every morning.

Like it's really 15, 16, 17, 18, 20 year olds. Yes. In the audience.

Talk about showmanship and just getting better in every area. She really did great. Added some choreo that I love. That was new for me from Meg's performance too. She added some choreo that I had never seen from her. I'm not saying that people that saw her on tour didn't see that. But I had seen a new, a new focus on choreo from Meg. I already told you. I thought LL Cool J was absolutely stunning and amazing that he brought Public Enemy out. Chuck D Fla, they gave him like a 10 to 12 minute run to go through every hit that he had Oh.


wow. And a lot of new records. He really owned the later part of that. What else? What else, what else? What am I other takeaway? Ty won the best Afrobeats song. Okay. For water. She was There. Yes she Was there. Yeah. There's a whole fucking shit going on online about her asking Halle to hold her award while she gave her acceptance speech. People just making a mountain out of a fucking mole hill out a Mountain. No, I, no, I don't think So I don't think they made a mountain outta Mole Hill though. Why? I wanna find Arman Wiggins' tweet. 'cause he said it a lot nicer than Imma said.


Actually, fuck it. Somebody else find it. The tweet while I fucking do this. She's annoying that girl. What? Go ahead. She seems, seems again, she's a young woman. I love her debut album. I'm not talking about musically, I'm talking about when she shows up in support of the music, she comes off like a dick. This is Armand Wiggins tweet right here. Spiritual World. My girl Big Mouth Hold me down. Armand Wiggins says, Hey, I don't think I like Tyler's personality. I think someone needs to check her because she doesn't understand American culture at all.


I could not agree more with this. She almost gives off entitled or Uppity African. I don't know how to explain it, but it's very off-putting and it's almost like she expects people to just fall to her feet. That is Arm Armon Wiggins, who I fuck with a lot. Shout out to him. If you don't know him, Google him yourself. But I felt like this before the VMAs by the way. Because she popped up at the Barclays in support of Usher. Yes, I saw that. That's And when Usher and when Usher attempted to do his showmanship dance while her record is playing. come on, let me, we in front of 20,000 people. She, she spun around. Let's get in our bag. She spun around. She dubbed him. She did She say that?


They say there's a reason for it. I don't give a fuck what the reason is. The reason is That She's got a man, I don't give a fuck about your man. Okay, so outta line, the reason is I'm Not outta line. You lying. You on this stage. I should got a girl. Okay, well Everybody Parameters is different. And he was coming up find Y'all preach your ideals somewhere else. We in front of 20,000 people right now. So you saying somebody should go, your album came out. I'm telling you what I'm don't step on. I'm saying, I'm telling you what I'm saying. That sounds dumb. I'm telling you what I'm saying. Your album came out ages ago. This mad money being spent on putting you where you need to be to be seen properly. Usher Raymond does not have to bring your little new artist ass on stage.


He don't. She was in the crowd save in the crowd Stage don don't give a fuck where she was. Tell that, tell that shit to your group chat. Once you hit the stage and you are a performer and your song is on and a legend is trying to highlight you, there is a way to do that. Doy do shit that she did with did. She did it in a way that looked real nasty. And I thought this before the BMA finish talking Then we Violy Palmer for playing into that nigga though. Hold on, hold on. Joe That is, she was in the crowd. She never brought her on stage in the crowd and tried to dance. She never brought her on stage. She was not on stage. Yeah. He came to her, he went to her in the crowd and tried to dance with her in the crowd. I hate talking music with non-music people.


Ice. Do you think that was by chance? You think that was an accident? No, he spotted it in the crowd and went to her in the crowd. Oh, so you think that was coincidence? No. No. They knew. Told. Yeah, they in the crowd. Do you think that was, it's like with Mel it's like Lucky day with Mel. Exactly. you know what? Exactly. So do you think that was a surprise to Ty? Is my question That Usher was gonna come over there and dance with her? No. She, So why the fuck you telling me where she was at? Because you're saying you brought on stage to dance. She didn't do that. I don't care where she was at. the show was going on and she dubbed him in a way that looked like, oh it was, it Was I'll dance. But not that Respectfully back up back. No, it gave don't touch me nigga is what it gave. Wait, so hold on. Wait. I got a nigga and he might, it gave don't touch me nigga.


It gave respect my boundaries my nigga. That's what it gave some women do that we have Nigga. It wasn't gyrating on the little girl's as looked like Behind. Yes he did. Yes. He tried to get by behind. He Tried to dance and backed Off. He tried to dance and Y'all eviscerated Tke Palmer. The same shit. Having a man and dancing Up on it. I love, love to see passion from you guys. She moved long before it was, I love to see this passion. Looks great. No, awesome. It's beautiful on y'all. She moved along before there was a pelvic thrusting from Usher. And right after I finished talking about Ty, we can get in there if Usher's a creep or not. I'm not Nasty. Hey wait, wait, wait. Hold up. That's fun to me. Okay. Niggas, I think these r and b niggas is creeps, I think.


And they do you making gumbo? I'm not trying, I'm not trying to invalidate what y'all saying. You're making gumbo, bro. No, I'm talking, I'm not trying to invalidate what they're saying. Sure. The r and b niggas be on some shit with girls that got a man and be doing shit on the stage and and trying to pass it off as showmanship. They do. And maybe Usher was trying to do that. Okay. I'm saying before the VMAs, the way that she did that came off away. This Armand Wiggins tweet is saying she just seems tone deaf to American culture. Now Armand Wiggins tweet sounds like some bullshit to me. Megan and, and He said I don't know this girl but don don't like how she acts. What? Right. Fem yo dog. But, but she, but every time You can see her visibly, there is something like this.


There was the Breakfast Club interview where It is like, okay, Got it. There's this Usher shit, there's this, when she accepted the award, your girl stop it now stop. You don't know that you getting up there to accept the award. Listen, I didn't even like how she fucking put her hand on the person that was walking her to the stage. I hated that. That's crazy. I don't give a fuck what you talking about. I'm telling you how I felt. There's a way to, you don't like the girl Joe? No, there's no let's come across Don't like the girl Joe. No, please. Just 'cause y'all don't agree. Don't don't fucking invalidate what I'm saying and let me say what I'm saying because I thought long and hard about what I'm saying. I've seen Taylor Swift and everybody else that get walked up there, do that same move away.


They all gotta get walked up there. I'm not highlighting her. But if you got a long dress on somebody's walking you to the stage, there is a way to depart from that person. I'm telling you that when Ty did that, it could look away. Let's continue it. She don't know that saying this award is too heavy and trying, Hey can you Hey Carrie, hold us. I'm not saying that she wasn't genuine in what you was saying. I'm saying it comes off away. Niggas are not off base for highlighting that it came off away and Chloe looked at her like, I mean, not Holly, not Chloe. Holly looked at her like, girl, yeah, Lil Nas, you better, you didn't watch it.


I saw that that clip is going. I'm Mario. The clip is that viral going every don don't the about a clip going viral. I'm talking about sitting there through commercial break and seeing it and feeling it in the moment. Fuck that clip. How would you have held it? No. So what the f But there's a man there. Maybe it Would've and he grabbed it as you said. Also, let me say Lil Nas X is fucking maturing like the kids from Stranger Things. Oh don't they got a new they pussy core? They pussy that well and they ain't see it, so let not throw on pussy. But they ain't see it. Lil Nas X is growing up fast.


don don't know if it's still cute anymore. Oh, I, yeah, I ain't see that So I go back, going back to shorty though. That girl comes off Away. She could, she could also have, She comes up entitled and p She comes off away I don. I I see, I see something different. I see them trying to keep her clean and mess free so she could have a team around her. Like, yo, we don't want you tied up with no niggas. No, we again, we saw what happened with Kiki Palmer. So Exactly. So she get to dancing with him. We fried up Now that clip is going everywhere. We are trying to keep this girl cookie cutter clean. We don't want none of that type of shit. We just want keep you clean. Not just that. We seen what happened with Mary j Blige when Usher got up there and was trying to, and Mary kept hitting that nigga with the Heisman shit.


We ain't say nothing. Nope, Not a fucking one. Mary's hitting that nigga. Like, stop playing dog. Stop playing again, nigga. I had enough of her. I need a new slap before I continue to support this off putting Shit. You ain't gonna water me to death. Oh man. Sorry. No, that's when she told her the whole award. I'm, I'm trying to find her speech. Here we go. You Guys know me. I'm holding awards. Yo. I I'm not, I'm not strong enough. You please over me. Yes. Thank you. I'm sorry. Thank you so much. Oh my gosh. Firstly, thank you.


Thank you. My tigers. Thank you. Yeah. I'm what you eat My team. God, everyone. This is such a big moment for Africa. African music. Like guys, the, the global impact that water has had on the world just proves that African music can be pop music too. Oh, I see. Y'all don't hear Hold up. Like, but you're going back to the African looking down. Shut the fuck. Hold up. Wait. You're going back to the Africans looking down on Americans. Is That is That, is that the, is that where you're coming from with this? I'm, I'm not gonna do that. Okay. That's what I'm saying. That's the only, I'm not gonna do that. That's why I hear you going with it.


But I'm telling you for the people that believe that she's a little offputting. It's not from osmosis. Okay. But okay, I see. We didn't need the impact of water to let us know that fucking Afrobeats music can be mainstream music. Especially if you've been around and listening for the last three to four years And we had an Afrobeats record. Do What Water's doing. don don't know. That's not my genre. I'm asking y'all a question. I don. I've heard this record everywhere. I ain't which one? What's an Afrobeats record and Canada record that's done with this This shit right here?


Yeah. What do y'all, I'm literal That question as a person that's not a fan of Afrobeats So, I'm just having a conversation and am my, I didn't get that from that. But we don't know how long it has taken for them to bridge that gap. Like these niggas could have been trying for the last 15 years to get that music to go mainstream. I'm telling you that this girl was nominated with the Afrobeat greats. She's a, she's nominated with DeVito, she's nominated with Whiz Kids. She's nominated with Burner Boy. Yeah. Shit. I think Drake might have been nominated. Somebody was nominated. I was like Oh Shit. But she's nominated with the people that do that in that, in that bag. And she won. Cool. Not taking that from her Shout out to her.


But how you normally sound as a new act that wins an award from the people that have dominated this genre. It normally sounds a little different from more appreciative, humble. It, it normally sounds humble d different than, hey, the impact of war that lets y'all know that Afrobeats is mainstream. What? This is just so special but also bittersweet because I know there's a tendency to group all African artists under Afrobeats. It's a thing. And even though Afrobeats has run things and has opened so many doors for us, oh African music is so diverse. It's more than just Afrobeats.


I, I come from South Africa. I represent Amano, I represent my culture and I just wanna shout out all the Afrobeats artists in this category with me. Shout out Thas. I Iris star. Shout out. Shout out Grandma whiskey Bonna boy, all of us and yeah, love you guys. Africa to the world stream, my album Ty, I'm off this girl. I am. I'm not arguing with y'all about it. I'm sick. But you know, Usually I'm I don I. don I don. But that's an American to African beef that been going on for years. Parks like that shit go outside American to African beef been going on for years. These type, I understand that part.


I understand that. Yeah, that's been going on for a long time. So When, you witness it in person. I'm not sure how much experience Joe has that's witnessed in it. In in person. You tend to have a sour taste in mouth. 'cause you know, sometimes people from overseas or around the world look at Americans differently, look down and they talk as such. I'm, I'm not sure if she did That. Like she seems socially awkward. She might be a little socially Like she seemed like awkward. She just don't know how to read a room and I'm not tearing her down 'cause she is a young girl. Hopefully she'll get better at that. But, but, But to It is just point. I'm sorry for cutting you off. You said that. How do you know that these people haven't worked hard to get African music or Afrobeats where it needs to be? We've seen plenty of awards where, you know, back in the days when Wyclef accepted award, he big up Haiti or plenty of people from different countries big it up like, yo, this is for Haiti or this is for Jamaica.


you know, we finally did it. We are here. We worked hard. We've been getting snubbed. So that could be her version of doing it. She's just repping re for People. Yeah. Re for Africa. I do understand what he's saying, but it could be her version of doing that. It Seems like people are reading into Excel like her for whatever reason, reason and not, and not only that like, But why would they not like her for whatever reason as a brand new act. She is a brand new Report. I think there's Such a No, I'm, I'm, I'm I'm asking a question, a further conversation. I think that they're, she, she's young and beautiful I think is one section of people may hate her for that alone. I think that she's successful kind of quickly, which is another reason why people may hate her. I think there's probably some color of shit in there somewhere. Oh, that's another thing. Them comments.


She made robed a lot of people the wrong way. And from that moment on, that's a point. It is been, it's been no matter what what she do, I remember not fucking with her. That's, And to me it was like, it was very much a loss in translation. Yes. Yes. Because you know the reference of using the word color, color to describe herself. She is from South Africa. Sure. This is a country that just basically got rid. Well I mean this Girl is a plant. Get her the fuck outta here. This girl is a Plant. I just think the expectation on her to be completely sophisticated and know how to, how to speak and what to say and it be perfect all the time. I think the expectation is just ridiculous. Is just ridiculously high. And if she's a plant, why does she have, why does she have the people around her to help her navigate through media?


She does talk, she does have those, but obviously whatever she said was offensive to some Because the reason it was offensive. Alright, so and, and So, I don't remember what she said. I'm about to tell you, in South Africa they have literally, literally Yeah. Classes on how they define Yes, I'm aware of that. People based on their ethnicity, et cetera, et cetera. Yes. How we use the word colored in America is to represent black people. Yes. In South Africa, the word colored means that you're mixed. Oh, Okay. It is of like a mixed descent. Got it. So she's saying colored based on what her definition of colored is versus the United States definition of what color It is. Okay. You understand what I'm saying? I understand that. I'm saying over Here saying loss in translation.


Like When Mel said in Canada they don't necessarily say, or in other countries, they might not necessarily say I'm black. They'll say, yo, I'm Swedish. They'll use their ethnicity to describe themself. The definitive thing about where they from. Got it. You get what I'm saying? Yes. Because black people come from all over the world. True. So here though, we don't do that. Got it. You understand what I'm saying? Yes. So. I. Just think it's, I think She hide behind that South African shit a lot. Don don't think so. She's South African. She's so South African. She is so South African. Not even just you, you Would've to educate me on the So South African means, You know, is that, you know, burg and stuff like that over? Yeah. Like, you know, they, they only like two generations away from apartheid.


Yes. you know what I'm saying? And so that shit was a whole different system of living that we couldn't fathom. Like even our parents couldn't really fathom that. you know what I'm saying? Like them niggas used to have to use a, a card to go past a certain point in Street. Exactly. There's parts of the country that they were not able to, couldn't even get in. You Couldn't get in. You gotta swipe a card to get past this game. Yeah. Wow. you know what I'm saying? Shit like, shit like that. It was, it was crazy. So you understand what the young lady, I don't understand it, but I did like book reports in college and shit. 'cause I'm, you know, I'm old in high school. No Got. it Got it apartheid was big when we was in high school. Got it Got it, you know what I'm saying? I was in high school in the late eighties. So, so, so, so that's when Reebok was getting boycotted and niggas are boycotting this company and all that shit 'cause they supported apartheid.


So basically she's just tone deaf like, like Mel said, like don't think She's not tone deaf. Tell the customs Here it's a loss of translation. Somebody said that and you, you know, just described how, you know, Americans have felt like Africans are, you know, really entitled and stuff like that. Africans feel the exact same way about Americans saying Yeah. Yes. you know, So I think I, to me, I just think that there's a real loss in translation in terms of like cultural understanding between the two. But We always hear in, in closing that people from the Caribbean are overseas. When they come to America. They feel that Americans or we are lazy and we, you know, we take advantage of the system. Unsubstantial music that lacks content in that liberal Boy setting.


In purposes it's for the Nigerian people. Now, if you like ni Afrobeats from the outside, do you understand? You, you It is Tim's on the Breakfast Club? Join us in the enjoyment of it. But Afrobeats was tailored for Nigerian people originated, I mean, I'm sorry, do you understand it uplifts the Nigerian people. Do you understand So I wouldn't look for something. If I'm looking for something in reggae, I cannot expect to find the same thing in Afrobeats. 'cause it's not tailored for the same people. So Afrobeats originated in Nigeria. Yes. I didn't know that. You didn't know that he's a dj. No, I When I would go to South Africa Shade. You just hear the Music. But South African is a ama piano.


Afrobeat is, and South Africa has other genres. But Afrobeat is not South African. you know, y'all got all the biggest Artists too. Yeah, Yeah. ABIs is Nigerian. That's standard. Okay. What that mean? It mean this won't be the first time or the last time that you hear something like what I'm saying, just bookmark it. That's what it means. It means that the people that have been doing whatever to drive attention, visibility and economy to that genre for the money to come in and for the new pretty South African girl to start winning all of the awards, this will not be the first time that you hear something like this.


That's, Doesn't that sound like a, a issue with more like MTV for instance for putting Emma piano in a, an afrobeats segment? Well, like I said, they put, they, It is another one I wish I remembered, but they put another r and b song, not Chris Brown and DeVito. That shit's hard. Chris Brown is, he don't play with the afrobeats shit. Yeah. But there was another song they nominated that was r and b and it was like, okay, y'all are broadening the Category. The category and the nominees here. And congratulations to her Water's water. And I love her album. I absolutely love her album. She has a good album. But if she, yeah, It is a great album, but if she is gonna maneuver out here I think that she should learn what, What if You had an Opportu? I think, I think it takes a lot of time to like adjust to American culture and really truly understand it.


You can't just observe it and then just be like, oh, okay, I get it. Especially if you are from another country and you know, just systems and values and just whatever else is just slang. There's Exactly, it's like literally a part of your DNA like the observation of American culture takes a really fucking long time to truly understand. And I'm saying this from the standpoint of somebody who came from Canada and people are like, oh, it's just the friendly neighbor to the north. No, it's a fucking different country. And it took me a while to adjust to American culture and, and understand just how nuanced it was. you know what I'm saying? The same, the Same way. We don't understand their culture. Yeah. Like If we And don't care to either.


Exactly. We go there because people accent on. I'm saying we're not trying to sell records over there either. Well, No, what I'm saying is my nigga, we could go down south and not understand down south. You can stay, You can stay in the United States. You could go from New York to California or from New York to Alabama or whatever the case may be. And it's just a different cultural rhythm that some of these regions has. That's true. So now When, you come from a whole different country across the world. I don't think her, she's gonna just adopt that shit like that. What I was saying, I'm off this girl to the next lap. Her initial don Don't, Everybody's initial problem with her with those comments and if they understood the culture, those comments wouldn't bother you. We Not just talking, yo, we don't need the deep dive because, and and we dry vagina up out there.


I'm not trying to cut y'all off, but It is not just the comment. That's what It Is. I don't want us to Focus on It is what I'm saying though. That started and for a lot of people, once don don't like you. right. Then everything else, whatever you do, don't like This shit as and that's what's happening with a lot of people. That's true. They don't like her from That. I'm not mad at you responding to those people with that. But what do what in the future, tell us what you will say to the people that are observing more than that. Like, rather than be dismissive and say, oh no, no, no. Like to the pe if, if you had to open your mind and say, okay, maybe there are some other things that has her look in the way. Even even even the, the Tims thing. Afrobeats, I agree with her. She would know started in Nigeria and then it grew.


That's what hap that's what you want. It grows. So now it's grown to another part of the country. And then from there, I mean y'all took it now international. I don't wanna connect these 'cause that's a separate clip. Tim Got, it wasn't saying that Got it in response to her winning an award. I wasn't So I don't wanna put her in that. I'm just saying. You saying there's, It's cool, we never, we never heard Tim sound like she was unappreciative for the evolution of the genre. That's all I'm saying. I'm off that girl.

That's What killed him. That's what killed him. Yeah, because he didn't Have, he didn't start lying and he didn't Have an audience to pan or two. Yeah. you Know what I'm saying? That's what It is. And that's why he was like Fucking, and they started checking him a little bit. He got kind Of mad at that too. That was my favorite part about it. Bias moderators. Yo bias moderators is fire. I know that. We live in a place where we try Oh, the bias, remove it. Nah, they were Kind, They were one dude, Dude is what I think they were. I think they were at the point like it's like, yo, my nigga the fed, The fed Up with This shit. Even if, even if I'm objective after your third or fourth lies, like yo dogs, you ain't answering nothing.


He said they're killing, they're aborting nine month fucking fetuses. They said after The baby's born They just, and they just executed. And I'm like, they don't like it. And Lindsay was like, nowhere in the United States. Does that even happen? Y'all failed. What do we Say? Yeah, but they was wrong. What? That's not true. That what what? And that's what I mean about bias moderators. There are 100% abortion clinics that are taking you past the time they're supposed to take you in certain states out here. That's that's, that's not What he said. That's not what he said Joe, hold on, say It again. He was saying that their like babies are being birthed after nine And then you like, oh nah, don don't like That. And then they're execut, they'll kill you. Execut born babies. Oh That's different. He was off the fucking rails. He wasn't even talking about abortion at that time. Like, Yo, the question was About the economy or something.


Like That's my point. Like yo he'll nigga, you'll ask him a question about, so what do you think about foreign policy and something something these Immigrants, not even foreign policy. No, no, no. You ask about something, anything bro. He's gonna start talking about, he didn't Answer the Question about whatever the fuck he wants about climate control. He didn't answer no Question about no, no. But he did talk about his crowd size. He did. And to be totally honest and to be totally objective, she wasn't answering all them shit's. Dead sinner Neither. I'm glad you took the baton for me. Yeah, I don't think neither. She wasn't either one of them. She was answering. She did a better job than him. But He, he didn't have the special earrings in. They found them earrings. They did Bro.


The Nova Sevens, They also found the Tiffany's, the Nova seven audio nigga earrings. She talked about. She gave a little bit more specific shit, you know what I'm saying? But neither one of them did a great job at answering the questions. Well She won. She came away. No, she definitely won. She smoked his. She smoked him and he don't want to do it no more.

And she actually, She got the heavy hit Of, seems like someone that I would want to represent me as a person. Like he sounds like a nutcase. I don, I don. She sounds like at least a logical human Being. Yeah, that's the point. I don't like her either, to be honest. If you want my talent. But it's good to hear what you I like more after When I did before. When she goes to meet another person that runs another nation in the world, I feel more confident with her sitting down than him. If there's a dis disagreement, I feel more confident in her resolving it than him. He gonna start calling you names. Yeah. Yo, you little dumb fat motherfucker. Like that's what he be on.

It wasn't a good, good night last night. It wasn't a good night last night. Are you ready to say Joe button? You may have been right. Not yet. No. Fuck no. I'm not ready. Fuck my life. Hey yo. I hate my life. If y'all give us There you go. Most are. We'll give you one of our backups. I'll do that in a heartbeat. Can y'all not do fantasy trades? Right? Now Y all talk about the actual teams. You talking about the teams nigga.


My man got another concussion. Yeah, They gotta find a solution. You can't, you can't go out there with a a second string quarterback. Y'all Want Russ? Yeah, I'll take Russ. I'll take case. Is that who your Backup is? You guys can We talk about his health? Yeah. Yo, What Don't don don't know. I don't know. I'm worried about his health. Yo, you gotta stop. Is this have my heart? You ain't give a fuck about that nigga health all last year, When, you came in here and cracked on that nigga. Every concussion He got. That was the year before last. Cello in his head. Oh part. You got, you got, I'm the one that came in here and said, Tua should never play another down. You have a lot more to live for and just sue the NFL.


That was my take. And then, and I stand on it and then he Went up and ran up the, the yardage title. He kicked ass last year and won Half a billion dollar contract. So I think he should have stayed in the Game. He absolutely kicked ass last year. I'm not sure that he wouldn't have received a hundred million dollars from a lawsuit. And I, my side is my side. My stance is my stance because it only take one or two. He can go out there and have a great two years, a great three years. We as viewers should not still see, what is it? Fencing? Fencing that that little fist, that little hand thing that he did As soon as I saw that I was That is I'm petrified to see that same, especially we just watched DeMar Hamlin game one last season die on the field.


And I believe in the power of the universe. I think it's no coincidence that DeMar Hamlin is the one that the accident occurred on. Yeah. That's somebody telling you something's Some irony. Yeah. That's crazy. Some irony. His irony Is funny, That is that those are the football gods saying, Hey, review this differently. I don't think Tua needs to play. You got, you got a guaranteed contract, you already got a hundred mil Parks. Lemme know earlier. What are you playing for now? It's tricky for the dolphins 'cause they paid them, they did guaranteed money and they feel like they can compete. Yeah. And they just watched him at a high clip last year. Last Year. Correct. So it's tough. And just from the move that to a pool, you know, that, you know, I'm trying to get the first down.


He was the, he was playing bad. They were, they couldn't get anything rolling on offense. He tried to be a Superman and Yeah. Run. I'm putting a team team on my shoulders. Which you wanna see from Yes. A player on your team. Obviously you don't wanna see the outcome. don don't Wanna see it from I don. And I don't think that the viewers or the advertisers need to continue to be subjected to people being laid out lifeless for seconds. I'm glad that he walked away on his own volition. But it wasn't a pretty psych at all. No, it's not. When, when his fingers Locked up and his arms, I was just like, Oh Shit. And it wasn't that brutal of a hit. No it wasn't. It, it was just an Angle. It was, it wasn't that brutal of a hit at all. Well he was really the one who, and Toa hit Hamlin more than Hamlin.


I was say it was more him initiating the hit than, than Hamlin. So. I mean you never want see that. Or Heart goes out to the entire Dolphins organization just coming from a football game. The Cols game. It is like, god damn. Like I'm, I know what that felt like in the building watching it. I know what that felt like at home too. At home as a teammate watching your leader go down that way and as a, as a front office like It is, It is bad, It is bad all around the board, man. Two, we love you. We hope that you make the right decision for you and your family. I'll be supportive either way I guess. But he's so young he don't need to go out there. Yo commentate, commentator back. Yeah. Call it's time. It might be time to call Tbs.


He's got personality or getting, he's very sharp in terms of X's and O's. Could be some type of coaching situation. Hell, it could be a backup situation. That may be what needs to happen. don don't know how you do that. When, you make that much money. But Who's your backup now? Skylar Thompson. He was like a six round pick a couple years ago. He kicked Ass in the playoffs. He Said he, he did. Okay. He did okay two years ago in the playoffs. He held his own against Buffalo actually. Yeah. Kept him in the game. He did good. But don don't know if that's a long term solution. I think you gotta go get somebody else And whatever concussions they have documented for him is probably not all the concussions. Not, Probably not. Yeah. Probably getting concussions since high school. Yeah, exactly. Probably shit in high school and college That would, Well we know what happened in college.


We know what happened when he got to the league. It's like dog, at some point it's not worth it man. You ain't, you don't need to try and win a CTE award. Yeah. You don't need to try to win that award because when that happened, while he's out in the field, I could vividly picture what he looks like as a 50-year-old, as a 60-year-old. True. Thousand Percent. And you don't want that. Yeah, It's scary. It's Terrifying. You don't want that. It's terrifying. Again, our hearts go out to, to everybody that had to witness that. The whole All Dolphin organization too and his family. Do what's best for you, yo. Yeah. Yeah. Listen to your doctors. Find good doctors. Do what's best. I mean, Sidney Crosby was a NHL player that had a lot, a lot, a lot of concussions. And he found some sort of specialist that got him right. And he went on to win a bunch of chips.


Was one of the best players in the league at some point. So I. Don't know. don don't know. Listen to the doctors and scientists and shit. They were saying that there's, there's that guardian cap. Yeah. And he doesn't wear that Though, right? He doesn't. Apparently the hat, the helmet that he wears has padding in the back. Which is how he got a lot of the concussions two years ago. Right. Because it was his back. So It is specialized specifically for him or at least for his situation that's caused all these injuries. I don't know if the garden cap's better or not. don don't know. I don't know. He's wearing that. That cap with a fade. No, he got some, he got some hair now. Alright. I might be trying to grow that shit in the back. Dog. Monster. Pause Said more.


We take Monster. You don't work for the Dallas Cowboy. I know It is fake. And y'all got Zeke Monster. Why? He did a whole bunch. He ain't do shit last game either. And he hurt now. Yeah, he is hurt. He hurt now. Fucking Moster. Cece tried to start fucking waddle against me nigga. Take them six points and sit down. Fuck is wrong. Ju cc about to clap him. Wre and Josh Allen. James Cook went off. What? And I'm playing against them. James Cook absolutely went off. Oh I know. We thought long and hard about James Cook or Or Kyron. Kyron Williams. Oh Shit. you know Williams? Yeah. What would you have them cook You the win?


Cook The guy rid of Diggs. Obviously their identity is gonna be 12 personnel. Dual tight ends running back heavy. Yeah. Yeah. Kin K. Way to go. Kin. K. Two weeks. I got about three points from you. I think he gonna kick up. Yeah. Oh better do it before I send him the waiver. Quick hits. Quick hits or quick corrections. Yeah. No, the mic. Yeah. you know him Elliot. Elliot Wilson is saying that Drake was confirmed. He's confirmed that Drake was asked to do the Super Bowl twice. Okay. I'm not mad at that. He ain't asked you four times, nigga. And I don't know if Roger Goodell himself asked twice. I think Elliot trying to get the algorithm.


That's What I think they might have asked you once. Might have sent somebody to ask you a second time. The NFL didn't ask him to do a goddamn thing four times.
