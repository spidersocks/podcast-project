You all Girl though. Alright.


What is important? Unimportant. What, what, what's happening in in the universe that we need to care about? Did any, I don't know if y'all covered it. Did y'all cover the cold show? No. No. Really? I wanted to Go, I didn't see it. Okay. I I, I signed up for the inevitable just because they live streamed it. If you were one of the members, ah, missed it. I shoulda. So I signed up just for that. And that show was amazing. It was free. Nah, It is the $10. Yeah. Oh. And the first thing I thought about was how many other motherfuckers did this? Yeah. No, I'm telling you, when they put the tickets up for sale, they showed how many people were in queue and the only way to get the link was to be signed up for the inevitable.


And it was 150,000 people or some shit in the queue for the tickets to buy the tickets to the show. So imagine the people that didn't even want to go to the show. Nah, I gave the AI girl my j Cole money Word. J Cole could have got that three. What? And then he did the dollar in the dream. He, they gave out dollar in the dream is something Cole used to do where he would've just announced a show nine o'clock in the morning. Y'all gonna be here tonight. Everybody show up with a dollar, you get a ticket for the show later on tonight. Mm. So they did that at Irving Plaza. 10:00 AM the line went around all four corners of Irving Plaza, then across the street and then all the way up the avenue.


Wow. And nobody got robbed. No, I ain't seen nobody get robbed. J Cole's a peaceful brother. Yeah. Yeah. That ain't the place for that to happen at. Yeah. But the show itself was amazing. He had a open, the dj, you know, warm the crowd up. But he came out, he went through the whole album mix. Tape cuts, feature cuts. Didn't bring anybody out, just smoked it himself. Mm. How long was the show? He went on at nine 30 and I think he got off stage at like 11. Mm. Oh damn. That ain't bad. His bounce back toward, he's crushing the, the end the year he's killing the Shit. Yeah. The whole podcast thing. The re-leasing the albums, the bonus tracks Just put the deluxe out on DSPs today.


Yeah. He he's anything you have bad to say about that beef shit? He's showing why let me do this my way. Yeah. And It is working. It Is absolute man Changed that conversation about him completely. Yeah. Niggas just kept, they just forgot him like kept him outta that shit. Now I see why. I think everybody sees why he stood out, right? Yes. Yeah, Absolutely. In hindsight it makes all the sense in the world. I mean just people wanted him to be messy. A com Yeah. That is messy. And a competitor in that like they wanted you to start mu slinging and all that bullshit and he's like, nah, I'm cool. I just wanna rap. If y'all gonna go personals, I don't wanna do that. We Know you like Mud Pos my nigga.


We know. We know. But Wade, that's not true. It's not. And I do let me recognize that. I do, but it's not Yes. People wanted to see that also. He told us he was with that shit. I he didn't tell us he was with that. He said I'm with rap battling. Yes. Got you. And if y'all are going there, I'm not with that. Let me get away 'cause that's not what I'm on. I wanna rap. If we gonna rap, let's rap. That's Then you're not really with it. I I understand. I I comprehend the point. But So you don't think it could be rap competition without it getting personal? I'm with has it ever though? I'm with, I'm with all the hand to hand combat in the world with anybody in the world.


The second that somebody want to exceed that point, I'm stepping out of it. I also know that this Could lead to that And pardon me, kind of could get to that maybe. So yes, I respect his opinion. I don't wanna participate in that shit showed that y'all are doing. But unfortunately sometimes the sheer competitiveness of MCs can lead to that or much worse shit. And it was death back in the day. It's probably still It Is. It is still death. Death Is in that today. So I mean I get the point and I agree with his decision making in hindsight. And I'm cool with well to, to him.


I'm cool with y'all so I don't have the hatred there to take it there with y'all. Now that's not to say maybe it's somebody out there that he really don't like that if it got there, I'm, I'm willing to go there with you But Yeah, Yeah, yeah. I don't want to do this with you. And I think somebody spoke to him and said and said Yo, This shit about to go ugly. You might want Yeah But move out the way and stop making it look like you picking a side 'cause it look like you picking a side and I'm about to start taking it like that. I think somebody may have had that talk with him worded differently. I don't know. But boy what a way to clean. Clean the year. What a way to close the year. Especially when all other rappers are obsolete. True music seemed, it do seem a little obsolete for me anyway.


Hip hop. Yeah. Or just everything. And I'm not just saying hip hop 'cause I think it's some of my favorite r and b acts that are just shit I I, we was having a Mely talk not too long ago. Fucking Danny Lay. Just some of the people that were granted a shot like an opportunity dis disappeared or, or that got on during the boom of 20 17, 18, 19, 20. Now it's like what do I do? It's different man. Covid came and changed a lot of shit. A lot of people spent money, invested money And now that all that dried up, ain't nobody trying to spend no money or they we in the red or they ain't get their money back.


Yeah we in the red. No I'm not spending no money no more. Now you gotta go out and do it yourself. So now you gotta spend your own money to get yourself a certain way and everybody ain't Got it to do it. Yeah, Yeah that's true. I feel like they've changed like some of the algorithms and some behind the scenes shit. I feel like it's changed as someone who releases music. Something back there changed. I don't know what, I have no evidence of it. It just feels different. That's the best way to, it feels different. Yeah. Yeah It is. It does feel Different. So I can see why a lot of people would be a little quieter musically. 'cause if they're fucking with shit back there we gotta adjust And people trying to figure out their way outta This shit. That's what I see too. I see a lot of people trying to get off that hamster wheel of the music industry.


I agree. And It is like yo, we not releasing shit until we can get this figured out. Everything else can wait, go get my old shit. I gotta be fucked up. That's exactly, Look this dude I'm laughing I gotta be fucked up place to be. I'm laughing 'cause I seen an interview somewhere with three stacks and he was the person he was talking to, he was telling him how his label didn't want to count the flute album toward the shit because they got some wording in the contract that says the next album has to be 90% like the last hour.

So What was I saying just now Andre 3000 you was looking at the Andre. Oh yeah 90% has to be album has to be 90% like last album. And he was like, he said he tried to fight it at first but then he was like the game is the game but they just got all types of tricks in there. I was like No we don't.


I know you right. Hey They publishing company day three K might be right on that one Buddy. You my man and all that. You can't but You the best. You one of the best to ever do This shit but some shit you can't do. Like artists are crazy. I'm not mad at the try neither. Try to get that shit off. I'm mad at the try if I'm the label that's waiting for my top selling diamond artist to hand in an album so the rest of these niggas could eat. I'm saying On his and you hand me in an album full of Flukes And and then and then walk in the corner office and say hey I'm done, I'm done. But The nigga please I'm How did that album do though?


I mean it's like Grammy nominated and shit. I don't know how SalesWise it did but I'm sure it's good for a flute album. It probably I, This shit I sold popping this flute album in the world. Listened to it and I was like, I actually like This shit on some mess massage.

Yeah, not at all. But again, everybody's trying to figure they ways off of that hamster wheel. So yo let me give him an album of a flute and see if it worked. What if it did work? I have gave four. He had four more than minute top. That's worked. It couldn't have been a terribly expensive album. No, no, no. I'm talking about what if it worked towards Spencer get outta in the Bathroom.

She said it was gonna drop at 8:00 AM I don't know if that meant Eastern Standard Time. Pacific Standard Time. Australian Standard Time. I about say we passed all of that and this Is supposed to be a full r and b project.


I think it's a, It is The Deluxe. Deluxe but it's like a, It is a, it's a new album. Deluxe. Yes. Yeah. Which tells me it should be. It shouldn't, this isn't gonna be four or five records. I'm expecting a full length project. I seen Summer Walker with Isha. I like seeing Summer Walker out. 'cause that mean that it's music coming. Well She got the show too. The radio show. What radio show? Apple was at Apple. Yeah. Summer Dud. Yeah. Yeah. When did that launch? Maybe it was while you were gone. I guess it like weeks ago. Maybe two weeks ago. Yeah. That's more good news. Yeah, that's another sign that music is done and only the Toxic bitches play at sped up. Hard of a woman. Shit on all of This shit.


Let you know exactly who to target or stay away from if you're faithful. That's all you hear. Sometimes the music. Oh. Thing that's saving you. Hey we send some eyes over there. Yeah. Summer has her, summer has her show. It's called Over It Radio on Apple. She got two episodes so far. First one was Sexy Red and this one is re Reha. Yeah. After Summer Sci. I'm kind of, I ain't gonna say a word. Yeah, no please do. No. Yeah we paid the over it radio. Your first episode was Sexy Red. Your second episode is Reha. Well Yeah, I'm not really seeing a correlation. Okay.


What you got Expound Other than that's Toxic Radio. Oh It is Toxic. Oh well. Yeah for sure. Well yeah, summer Walker. Summer Walker. Summer Walker. But I'm saying you named Michelle well over it. Didn't she have a song? Her album. Album? Yeah. I thought that was the name of the song. Her Albums. No, her album over it. Still Over it. And now it's finally Over it. Which is Cap. Yeah, we know. All right I'm Back over it. When are they finally over it? When did they find something new? Well even then might not. Yeah, You right. Yeah. I don't believe that Summer Walker's finally over. Well unless you're talking about Larry. I do believe that he's probably not still fucking Yeah, Larry in Pain Over Him. That's fucked up anyway.


Can't wait till I get this new music from, from Summer and Scissor and anybody else who wants to participate in this music game. Literally Anybody. Anybody out there that's Got it. I'm listening to demos. It was a good year though. I can't, I can't front. It was a lot of good music that came out this year. It was. It's weird that we're not getting any type of blockbuster shit. Well I guess It is if it happens. But, and usually Christmas time is like, you get somebody For that fourth quarter. You get the The heavy hitters. Yeah, We got Kendrick. That's true. We got Kendrick. We got all the TDE. But I'm saying fourth quarter. Oh, fourth quarter. Okay. We did get Kendrick. Yeah, it's still fourth quarter. We might, do you want to count Cole? Not really. It's an old project. I mean it's new songs. New songs. A old project.


I thought his release date in February. You have a release date. I mean he said it's coming out around February. The, the album. That may be true. I don't know. True. They did say at the show he said 'cause the the Dreamville Festival coming up, It is the final one. That's the last one. And he said I'll see all that Dreamville and hopefully I have some new music to perform by then. Like as a teaser to the fan. He's definitely got new music course that before Dreamville. So everybody's anticipating the album at least before then. And that's April. So it might track Which means it's probably, well it's different. I was gonna say it's probably close to done at this point. But in this day and age in the music business, they'd be doing shit the last second.


So they Go back after a drop. That too. Music business is fucked. Running around, buying up the independence. Yeah, I saw That. We're trying to find a way like again, people trying to get out and they're gonna find a way to try to reel you back in. We'll change it over here. We we'll they did it. You was going over here to Spotify going over here to these com, the DSPs direct. Oh nope. Nope. Now we got them. Yeah, I know They're gonna buy up the little independent distributors. Some of them shits be probably kicking off boy. Because if you think about it, if there's, what'd they say? There's 300,000 songs released a week or something like that. Two corn distro kidding them is eat. Oh yeah, for sure. For Sure. Or you think that the major's gonna stand by and watch that? No. Or they're just gonna offer the same service.

And Yes, I heard your show. Mm. I like how he, you know, we got, that's not gonna find, we should stop doing a little bit of, you know.


No, I think you could totally down a little bit. I'm a private guy, guy. You know, my family watches. What else? What else, what else Homeboy? They, they, they did the jail walk, the New York walk, The perp Walk now With Luigi. Luigi Mangione. I thought that nigga was Hannibal Lecter. Oh, Chapo or some motherfucking body. I know. I had to go look up his crime again. I was like, they walking him. They only Shot a nigga. They ain't do that for Rakim and them when they shoot a nigga. What the fuck you talking about? Nah, he ain't just shoot a nigga Shot a very, very Expensive dude. He shot the CEO with a four, four largest, largest fucking company in the country.


He shot a nigga. The fuck did you talk about? Yeah, This was theater. Exactly. Yes. This was theater and this was taxpayer money. This is bullshit Helicopters and all. I'm like, yo, Jesus Christ. Just like trying to like taint the fucking jury pool. Why? How so? Because don't you, don't you think that that theatrics makes people think, oh, he's so dangerous when he went out of his way to make sure that there was not the possibility for any level of casualty past his target. Oh, the, the good looks worked on you. He finds hell, I'm sorry, The good looks worked On you. It's, but it's not even Mel.


So you don't think that he's extremely Dangerous? No, I don't, I do not think that he's dangerous the same way. I don't think the fucking Menendez brothers are dangerous. Joe, let me ask you this. He might be dangerous, but see you watch too much then, then you More Question much, you might, you watch too much. Jason sta them. That little bony ass white boy did not need 77 cops with they Sunday's best on as escorting him around the world. And Eric Adams don't, I don't know the fuck was He doing There. I don't know that I agreed with that. I don't know. I don't know that I agree with that. Whereas, Because I, I saw an attorney come out and say that they're gonna have problems with jury selection because it's so much sympathy for you. Yeah. Yeah. And so what happens down on the other side is let's paint him to be as dangerous as possible to try to balance that back out.


But I think that's having the opposite effect. I think It is. It is. I think it's making him look more like a martyr. I think that It is. He's gonna look like that regardless. Yeah. I think it's just increasing public support for him Because of who it was he killed and what he represented. And because so many people can relate, relate to it. To what? To, to the reasons why he took these matters into his own hands. Well, you seeing the comments under the, well Slow down for a minute. I want to try to have some of these talks. Okay. Y'all dead ass. Yes. Yeah, yeah. Thousand percent dog. Okay. Media, media propaganda is, is and has been a part of most trials, The major ones.


Media propaganda and, and misinformation. All of That is absolutely all of That is there for sure. So I'm not arguing your point about mind games to potential ju jurors, but that existed. That existed already. This is high profile enough to where that was there. True. Two New York City, and I don't have all of the facts, but New York City was, they was in a fight with pencil pa or whoever, Pennsylvania over extradition in the first place. No, no, no. It was him. It was him. That was him. He was gonna wave his extradition at first.


No, no, no. He was fighting extradition. He was fighting extra up, up waving him. That's I'm, He eventually waved. He eventually waved him, but at first he said he Was fighting. Yeah. In New York. Wanted him in New York. The place of the crime. Yeah. No, get his ass over here. That went on a little longer than we expected from that. I'm certain that they were getting pressure from whoever is above them. You don't kill somebody that the CEO of the fourth largest, yada yada, yada yada. And you're not pressured from somewhere to get the guy that I agree. We watched kill him and take a city bike somewhere. So yeah, I do understand the reason for the long dramatic walk shit. They did it with me at a much lesser level when I got arrested on Dikeman that they call the news, they tell the news the time that you're gonna take the walk from back there and we gonna film you and put you on the fucking news.


Mm. So yes, I get the perp walk and the off whites, the off whites we'll get to at another, at another time. Also, I already told y'all how I feel about premeditated killers versus the niggas that just pop you randomly at, at the spot. If dude could plan this out this way, I don't doubt his brilliance. He was this valedictorian, saluted, dic Victorian went to wherever MTI, wherever he had an MTA card, I don't know. But highly, highly educated. He's more of a city bike, highly educated brother that, that, that comes from mon a family of money, of money for him to plan out, write a manifesto, stake out and stalk at six in the morning with his weapon of choice and his exit strategy and all but damn near commit a perfect crime if not for his stomach growling.


I think that person is dangerous. I think that person is dangerous. You Don't, you don't get to not be dangerous because a lot of people agree with what you did. True. You're still a dangerous man. Cool. Got it. I'm, I'm, That's all I'm saying. No Semantic, You right. Y talking about him like Seman, you're right. But once they got him, they got him right. Do you look at that guy and say, yo, he's gonna break the cuffs, knock 12 cops out and get away. No, no, no. So in, But that wasn't the reason for the, for the dog and pony show. So what's the reason? That's the point. Niggas is saying, yo, you got 50 cops around this kid. Like he's gonna magically break free and run and get away.


Like he jet Lee or some motherfucking body. He's not that. What do you Say? The point was, we have 50 cops here because we, people have been on our ass for however many days that we didn't have this guy. We probably about to lose mad money and budgeting and yada yada yada. All that shit that's above y'all just Wasted. It Is the show. It is. You say wasted it. We It is our money wasted. Yeah, True. It is. Well I don't live in New York, But yeah, I get it. And we seen all the cops, but I don't know the level of all of those. I seen some cops that looked like they was the big dog cops. It looked like multiple law enforcement agencies.


Fucking Eric Adams was there. That's what saying like a lot. That's the that's what I mean is it's one. Yeah, it's the, it's one thing if you have him doing the perp walk, but it's another thing if you have helicopters and 50 cops, the fucking mayor that's, Yeah man, they might Have firework this motherfucker like he was bad bunny my nigga. That's what We talk him out. Yes. It is like A joker or some Shit. That nigga's going to Rikers bro. Sit His little white ass. He's not gonna Rikers. He's gonna mdc. I'm just playing. But yo sit his little ass over there. That's probably why he ain't want to get extradited. I'm over Here and I don't understand y'all. We say all the time. Shit, you just said it a couple seconds ago. They didn't do all that for cousin Raheem.


Right? Like there's this, there's this thing in the black community where we've seen what they, they'll do for some and we seen what they won't do. We, we seen crack head Brenda die and nobody bat an eye and Dylan roof go get Wendy's. Yeah, yeah. But not only that, All I'm saying is this dude wasn't just some dude. Okay. And I still high profile and I still want to be, but they still somebody that had a family. Now, Hold on one second. So hold on a second, kids. Let's, let's do a comparison between him, Luigi and what he did and the Sackler family. Do you know who they are? The Sackler family is talking Sackler.


Wait, wait. Talking to, talking to you know who That is. Okay. Alright. Who you talking? Who you talking to Me? I ain't I'm you not talking. You lost the doc. I am sorry. I did. I am not talking to you. I am just basic. I'm talking, I'm talking in general to her girl. For people who might not know who the S is, but I know you know who the Sackler family is. They are responsible for the opioid crisis in this, in this country. They are responsible for the death of 300,000 fucking people. Not a single one of them saw the inside of a fucking jail cell. Nothing, no criminal charges whatsoever.


Okay. If, if you're talking to me, I don't condone death. I don't agree with killing some of the people that should be Killed. So what I'm, all I'm saying is That's not the, that's not the, so this is the retribution. I understand that. I sign up, I understand. This is all I'm saying. But you, but I just wanna be clear. Yeah. Because you saying, Hey, none of them received jail time for me. I'm taking that as Yeah, somebody could have maybe taken the law into their own hands and we got in street justice with the Sacrifice. No, no, no. What I'm saying is, if you're wondering where the sympathy, where the lack of sympathy is coming from, you know, generally speaking, like, you know, taking the temperature of how everybody feels about this particular story and why nobody seems to care about the fact that this was a human being and he, you know, and his family lost him and stuff.


Oh, I Understand This. This is the reason I understand this is the reason the, this is the reason, reason why there is such an apathetic way of looking at this story and why people are looking at Luigi as a fucking hero. This is why, that's why the conversation is always being approached from this particular standpoint. I know my response to That is, what did he fix? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. But I understand it'll shed light on. I Understand he created the conversation. He, He it'll shed like, like don't, I don't think He created a conversation and he also, and we've we've we've had a lot of discussions about con You killed a right nigga, you gonna create a conversation. True. We've, We've talked a lot about consequences and we've also talked a lot about consequences that were, that didn't necessarily meet the, meet the crime.


You know what I'm saying? Or meet the offense. Case in point, when we talked about love and death, the whole k story and we talked about the consequences of a man and a woman having an extra marital affair and what the consequences of that were and how it's just like, did anybody deserve to die? No. But there's consequences to your actions that you might not understand what those actions might be, depending on who It is that wants to met out those, you know, met out the, the quote unquote justice or the vigilantism. You know what I'm saying? That's just my whole point of why everybody seems to be talking about this. Like he is a hero and seemingly so apathetic towards the CEO who lost his life because of what he stands for.


True, true, true. It's what he stands for. Like, yo, so so somebody in congress needs a heart or a kidney. Nobody gives a Fuck. They no, they gonna get it right. But somebody's uncle that's broke, or somebody's mom that's broke needs a heart or a kidney. They Get and they's down On the list, they stay on the list for 77 years and they gonna pass away. Right. That there's a level of apathy where I don't give a fuck. Yeah. Or yo, my, my peoples couldn't get a, a surgery, but your bonus was $27 million last year. Like, I don't give A fuck. I I, not only do I comprehend it, I receive it, I get it to those people. I ask, what are y'all going to do to the new CEO?


Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Same shit gonna happen. And then the new CEO True, I agree with you. And then the new CEO that's my only problem with dudes manifesto. It's like, damn, you do seem like this. You were well thought out, calculated and had a plan that was like a kind of long term that you had been working on. The death of one CEO didn't, didn't, didn't Change, didn't scratch or nothing. Yeah. But it sends a message. It sends A message. It does send a message. And I think the message is the eat the rich message. Oh Thank you. It's eat the rich. I was gonna say that could not, we not Yeah, but I don't agree with that. Me. I just want to stay clear for me. No, I get that. I do not agree with, We are not hoping killing people.


None of This shit happened. But we eat the rich that shit. You the rich send a message dog. All it takes is one, sometimes all it takes is one some time to inspire everybody else to start doing that shit. You gonna be on somebody's charcuterie. I was, that Was such a mean, that's such a mean thing to even say charcuterie expensive too. It Is. Charge it up. Yeah. You would be, that cheto right there. Hey. Oh man. But now, like if, if let's say niggas get inspired by that, that's now we are not hoping. Yeah. Yeah. Some other CEOs start dropping out there. True. They took niggas names and they hot nigga CEOs of these people. Nah, They, they, they locked up another little white girl somewhere else.

I believe in Pennix First game though. Who did, who? Who's the receiver that the Bears took in the first round Und Day? Noe? They got UND Day. My man From the Chargers. He the, he been going crazy about The draft. I'm talking about the draft. Oh. Oh, okay. In the first round, they got homeboy who went to the same school as Pennix. I watched, I watched some of them games in college. I believe in Pennix. And at my draft it was people saying, listen, the second that Pennix gets in the game, it's a go. I like Pennix. I was just worried about first game. Not me. He scrambles. And I had, and I watched Kurt Cousins for the last however many weeks. So what's your man? I gotta put more respect on Minnesota's oc. He's nice. Yeah, I do. He's nice. Yeah. He makes him darn look like that. Why? Because Darn wild did going crazy. And he did it with Kurt Cousins. I have every reason to believe he was gonna do that with JJ McCarthy, the rookie that they drafted. Like I just believe in them. And I see what Kirk looks like in Atlanta and you can't get much worse than what's going on there. So I believe in Pennix. So gimme Drake, London for more than 75 receiving yards.

Wake up and see 2.7 on the, Here. I'm going right to the fucking Journal Square, Edgewater Commons.


Wherever there's a party City at. Oh Shit. Yo, I knew it was bad. They start putting Party Cities up next to the liquor stores and churches. I was like, oh, it's a trick. It's a trick. Y'all. Oh man. Nigga started selling bandanas in that bitch. They did too. That's the fucked up shit. All the Colors, all the, Oh, like the United Nations in that bitch nigga. The Party City dude clearly didn't see any of the docs about Dollar Store or 99 cents store. No. Uhm they Was giving, he would've changed his business model, immediate model immediately.


He ain't own it. Dollar Store paid the fines and they paid the fines for doing This shit and kept doing it. They kept pushing the fines. Ain't bringing in more money than, I mean, costing more than what we make Sackers. Yeah. Fuck you talking about. The Sackler, the cost of doing business nigga expensive. And it's a write off. Ta-da. No. Yeah, but you ain't about to gimme the refurbished Dow soap for 5 99. Shit, I want my Dow from Dow for 5 99. Not the refurbish shit. This shit be Italian. This shit don't even have to Dao Nothing, bro. Nigga this D he right d He right with a Sharpie Scentless.


It is That is that Scentless now My mind no smell. Yeah. I was doing, man, stop fucking playing, playing with Me, man. Shit. What else? What else, what else is happening out there? Spotify responds to Drake's suit. Right, right, right. Yeah they did. They Did. I They just denied everything basically. It is a denial. Yeah. What they gonna say? Yeah, we did that shit. We're not in business. We haven't had any bots and shit like that. They, they can't ever admit to that. Yeah, that's not possible. So what's gonna happen is in about six, four months, Mr. Graham and Spotify have come to an agreement for an undisclosed amount of money.


That's what's gonna happen. Drake's still making music though. True. So they still gotta have a, some sort of a business relationship. I think You disagree. I don't know if that's for certain. Like, it once had to be, remember when all 'em white people was taking their music off Spotify? 'cause Rogan said some shit. Or the light like, I want leave that option, Nelson. I wanna leave that option for the brothers too. True. Like he don some black. That's This shit over there. A bunch of people have done it, but then usually go back Once The business. I'm just saying once, once you do the lawsuit and make me think that you, you ready, You ready to go all the way.


You, You, you ready? So if that means me not putting my music over here, if he even has that right then Yeah. I just don't know. I don't know. That's Where it gets tricky though, is does he have the, The right, the right to do That? Yeah. That shit be puzzling because when you read some shit, like yo, they on their own masters, but then y'all be saying yo, you calling your own masters and still not have rights. Yeah. Because that fucks me up with your masters. You licensed it to this company to dis to distribute and now they distribute how they see fit. So yeah, you own it. But if I, if I own something, I license it to you and you decide to put it wherever you want. I don't have no control of that. Gotcha. Because I licensed it to you. Gotcha. I still own it.


Got you. So that's where it gets a little tricky at the trial. I mean, not the trial. They were supposed to have a hearing. The dates kept getting moved around. First it was December 20th, then it was December 19th. Now they've moved it to January 13th. Who? UMG and Drake's team. Yeah. Got it. Well, the, the petition of court, we wanna move it postpone. So now it's it's January 13th as of as of today. So I guess we'll just wait and see. Wait and see what happens with This Shit gonna happen on January 13th. Walking in set a new date. Yeah. At Drag this out a little bit. Wonder what that nigga put in an hour.

So we gonna reschedule this, put this on the docket for, and they'll look at the court clerk and the doc and that today might be the 23rd. They'll be like, oh yeah, we'll see you guys on next month on the 19th. You gotta pay your lawyer nigga for all of them eight hours. Plus they travel, plus they parking. Oh.

And look, when we come back on the 19th, I gotta pay it again. Right. They charged but you Oh no, no, no. Look, they they charge you for thinking. Look, so now No, no. Some shit done happened in that month. She done acted up again. So now some new shit y'all had to discuss a 15 minutes. You getting a WP nigga. That's where Kendrick Got it from. Wp WP them nigga you whipping your ass and what? Yeah. No, this Nigga just sitting there like Yeah. The nerve of me. Yeah. Yeah. I'm trying to just be cool. But you, you, one day you'll come, you'll stop This shit.


All right. One day you'll stop This shit. Yeah. Hopefully. 'cause no one I stopped, I paid a buck 50 to negotiate breakup terms and not go to court Joe. And you didn't miss a wink of sleep. No. Yes I did. A buck 50 for Antoine. It is different than a buck buck 50 for you Aki. No, but not, not when it happened. Not when it happened. Not when it happened. That's not True. And it, And, and it don't be the, that don't be the point. That don't be the point. You going, you trying to go through a amicable, amicable breakup. Which is tough when you're dealing with somebody that has emotions that are not trying to be amicable Percent. Absolutely. You telling them exactly what's what the, about what this is about to be, What the white's about to tell 'em, Fuck what you talking about.


Fuck what you talking about. Let's just go through it. You done went and got one of these bus beat ambulance chasing niggas. That's just gonna do it in the arm. You lawyers need to go to trial. Actually I ain't, they Need to. They they the one The, the shit that y'all doing out there with the taking these cases and promising on the win and the back end. Oh, it's just free. Let me do the work. Y'all are disgusting. But yeah, you can tell 'em exactly what's about to happen and still you gotta go through it. And then I looked at one of them things for the month and was like, okay, don't send every email I don't Send I tell you to send. Yeah, you'll modify what you Yeah, you don't need to, we Don't gotta talk all That. Oh yeah. No, the talking is is is Yo smoke signal me my nigga. Yeah, they tried to I'm sure put it in the air dog pause like, yo, I'm good.


That is trying to read your mind. That shit is a monster. Yeah. You better be Lucky. I'm sorry that you had to pay that that 5,600 For one day. Fucking bu for one day. Does anybody have the translation? Speaking of Busby, of what Rock Nation was trying to say in that they, they some shit they they went digging on him. Yeah. He said you got herpes and you a bitch. That's, And shorty was young. He said he had a Ari. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And she was young Too. They doing the sm smear campaign stuff. I don't, I don't know. I don't know what's going on because it was confusing to me. I didn't totally understand. Yeah, me either. I guess he probably did. Yeah. I think they playing the game that he playing from what I see.


They're playing the game that he playing Word. This what you're doing. All right. Feel you gotta pass too. And I got some money. You get what I'm saying? So now the same way you doing what you're doing, I'm gonna now reverse it and go look up for shit in your past. But doesn't It, the whole thing was, we worded so weird though. Like when I first read the Rock Nation state, I was like, huh. So from what I heard they had, this is speculation. They said that he came forward and tried to extort Jay months ago, like maybe like six months ago and said, yo, we heard your name in the case too. So if you don't pay us, we said Jay immediately that same week went and filed a lawsuit against him.


Well the way they, the way they're explaining It is it wasn't like that. It was we send over a demand letter. Gotcha. Which means we demand, let, let's sit down and talk about whatever this how much money we gonna get. That's the, the, the translation. Gotcha. The letter just says, let's sit down, talk about this and see if we can prevent anything from going forward. It's like a clean way of saying extortion pay up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a clean way of saying it though. Okay. And so they said that Jay-Z's people immediately went and filed a suit. Mm. The original suit with the 13-year-old girl didn't even have Jay-Z in it. They bought Jay-Z in it recently, almost as a retaliation for the original suit that Jay-Z and him put toward the dude Busby.


Okay. So initially he wasn't even a part of This shit. So from what I gather initially, that's a little mixed up. Well his name wasn't in there. It had Puff and then it said in another celebrity, Celebrity A and celebrity B. Yeah. So they went back and said okay, we're going to unveil who celebrity A is and a female watch the female celebrity. So let's say we said Celebrity B could have been 20 different niggas that we trying to extort. We send the same demand letter quote unquote around to 20 different motherfuckers and see what we can turn over. That's dope. It's back to my discernment. I don't trust nobody named Bus me anyway.


Shit's Not little movie and Shit. Getting little crew cut nigga. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It be signs. Y'all let homeboy in with the haircut and then got mad that he fucking said all that shit. It's like the signs are here. Niggas don't just look for the Hitler mustache. Like you gotta ask for that. Like you, you gotta say gimme The Hitler cut get and the curly fry.
