Like I don't know why niggas think they the only ones out here moving around. Yeah. Yeah that's true. That's True. Niggas are not the only ones out here moving around. The Only niggas with game. Some of these chicks got more game. Parker brothers and some of these niggas. Paul right forward too. And Listen, these niggas is such suckers not speaking to anybody in particularly, but niggas is such suckers that for the girls that don't even take a whole lot of game, it's just taking honesty.


Yo, I'm with you Tuesday and Wednesday nigga when I leave you, I'm going over here to do this over here at the Timberwolves game for a few, then I'm going to Aspen. I'm flying there with the London soccer nigga that don't know none of y'all. No, no, no. Look from there. I will be in Turks soon. Hey y'all know a nail tech in Turks. They gonna put it right in. Does anybody know m Uua, m Uua M Uua and Turks. I'm here just for 24 hours. Remember It's different. What Corinne was saying about, she was like, yo, I tell whoever I'm with. If he call, I go, It is different. I would pick up in the middle Of the night. What is the difference? It We understand that.


Right? We understand that once you put a ring on somebody's finger, that understanding I don't think is the same. That's not the truth. When we, that's not always true here. I just told you Wayne shit Couldn't disagree more That he different. Some people do. But the People We talk talking about a person married from we in different, we in a different league. In this class that we talking about, we not talking about homeboy to work at the bodega. Nah, I know I'm talking about once you get, 'cause we all understand the game is the game. But once you decide to marry somebody, I only know of that one situation the ice is talking about. But that's because she Corinne, but she is a different mom. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know what I'm saying? She's open like that. I'm pretty sure it's a couple of them out there. Niggas just don't want nobody to know.


I don Know maybe in the generation of, of young women that come from the Corin family tree. That may be so that that may be true. We, we not the only ones that see what's going on out there. The girls have it good right now. If I could go marry this sim ass nigga again, I'm not speaking specifically about them. I'm just speaking in general. In general. If I can go marry the simp that's going hold it down and still get my 10 K from you, my 20 K from you, my seven k from you, he ain't gonna pay me. But he gonna pay for the bags and All shit. Him. I only even gotta speak to once every six months over. Like we not the only ones. The hills have eyes And for the dude that's the simp dude or whatever, he might be fucking Reaping the, the benefit to the 20 keep 30% Off your, off your fucking tax.


Good point. On top of maybe getting a cut of no, whatever the little ticket she's getting Is driving, driving whatever he's driving, living whatever. He, they Playing high stakes ultimatum from A moral standpoint. Obviously's crazy. But I, I could like Get it. Have you ever heard of a situation like what you just described? Yeah. Kind only One. Not famous people. No, the only one I've ever heard of. But like swinger type relationships or open relationships at a marriage level. Yeah. That exists. Well Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, but what you just described in terms terms of with the money. Yeah. In terms of him benefiting from All they called pimps. Well I was speaking more to the tax benefit than the making money off whatever Ls. Okay, okay, okay. Niggas married a picture. Yeah. Yeah.


Yo niggas are marrying these. I don't, under niggas are women just marrying women. She doing what she do. I know what she do. That's what I'm a fan of. I'm gonna marry her 'cause I wanna experience that majority of my years. And yeah, if she gonna go run around over there and let her go do it. Like everybody don't have the big, a big beef with it. That's true. I ain't really heard nothing from Devin Haney. No. I stand, I stand corrected. 'cause again, It is a a if you gonna reap the benefits of what she out here doing, you are pimping you. Pimping You. Right. Yeah. No matter how you put it. Yeah. And then my thing is like, and listen, a lot of guys have have had it bad like usher this holiday run. Yeah. But the flip side of that coin is even with the Travis shit is yo niggas love who they love and you, you mind your fucking business.


Like who are we to say what people know or don't know about the person that they into. It's a whole fleet of these young NBA 21, 22, 23, 24 year olds that's searching for this. They coming in the league to get this type of treatment from this type of girl. Yeah. And Lena is That type of girl. Yeah man. So I mean shit, if that's what we love, that's what we love.

They're not, they're not going to respect or Not spill The beans. And these sensitive ass niggas can take an take up an issue with as many of those people as they feel true that their choice. All right, well nigga, sit your dumb ass down. You can't hate the players of the game, bro. The rules are the rules. And the rules don't change. Everybody don't play the game accordingly. But What we talking, that's why I, I got faithful before that twin shit became a thing.

I'm good. I'm good on that. I'm not spending another second on any of that Travis on this stuff.


I'm not, I Feel you. I Ain't, It is what It is. And what I will say is It is a lot of you doofy dudes out there and women, you gotta put the chastity belt on when Doofy niggas are trying to fuck. 'cause now homeboy from 2017. Yeah. Oh Yeah. It is going in his phone, leaking the Sound back to The summit. Yeah. Man, I hate seen all the people like, oh man, how, how dare she do that?

You wouldn't be mad at her about that. Like, oh yeah, she was making him super whatever the fuck she was doing, she should have been, that's her fucking man at the time.


The one, the one corny dude that came out after the fact and was like, yo, this actually happened a long time ago. I just made it. I was clout chasing. Yeah, You could see it. It made it seem like it's now like that screen caps, all that shit is Three years ago wasn't the thing. All the screen Caps. Yeah, they've been together five. Yo, guess what? I don't wanna know that. Yeah, yeah. I don't wanna know all these intricate details and none of these people's relationships now. Well that goes To the other point where everybody's just oversharing. I'm cool until a car get burnt on fire. Then I want to, I want to hear what, like what happened. Like if the story ends in a bang, then you got me. But all of this other shit, I'm cool fam.


I'm cool. I am. My heart goes out to all indeed. Thank you. And all y'all out there. Fucking Indeed. That is clear. Yeah, it's a lot. Lot of pregnancy reveals too. It is a little holiday season. I seen the little motherfuckers I follow. I ain't know they was taking the pictures at a angle for a reason. Yeah, Yeah. It was a lot of reason for A lot of them. Like, wait, wait, ho Hoing. Yeah. Now, congratulations. You follow. Everybody wants a Virgo. But outside of that, outside of that, yeah. Virgos, you know the vibes. You know. You know what I, It was already three or four months, huh? In the shit I seen. Yeah, they Was hiding.


They had the little baby bump one little No no. Now it's a little grown. Like that's a whole nigga In there. Now we celebrate every bundle of joy. Nigga here now nigga Here We celebrating them little shits. That is true. Oh man. I keep telling my parents now, I don't give a fuck how much y'all fight. Like y'all got along when I needed you to, I'm here. Yeah, that's the end. Have at it. Go on over there and not get along for fucking 60 years, 70 years. I don't give a fuck. Fuck that job done. I'm on Earth. Yeah. Chilling, menace, Chilling minutes, menace and Earth. Chilling Man. I, what else? What else? What else is super important or unimportant? I feel like a lot happened, but I did, I missed the ball.


Oh, You wasn't here, did you, did you get a chance to listen to Scissors Deluxe? Yes. Get your thoughts on it? We, we, we touched on it briefly. Paul Scissors Deluxe. I, I enjoyed, I listened to it a bunch more. I have some different thoughts than I did before. Better or worse. It feels like a bunch of demos to be honestly, You took the next sentence outta my mouth. Yeah. While I enjoyed it, I think she's too talented to not make good music. But it felt unfocused I guess I would say. Yeah. It, it felt like, let me just hit the vault with these good sounding scraps and deliver it.


Are we, we we mad at that? No, She's fine. No, Not at all. No, no, no, no, no. I'm not. Because scissor on a laundry day is better than most of the field. Yes. So it's some good slaps on it. I mean, I was disappointed because right when I thought Scissor was about to scissor on a couple of the songs that ended, so like, you're giving me a lot of these two minute teasers. Two 10. I know what a scissor bridge sound like on this. I know what a right. Like, and it was supposed to be like the r and b, but I saw when she can't help but get into her. Yeah. She her bad. She a Couple of them on there. Yeah. And they sound good. They do. I didn. They sound good. I ain't like them. But SAI skipped over and, I mean, I'll get into this a little bit of this when We talk, when we review Beyonce, but it's like, It is, It is difficult for the greats today for me Because they've been so great.


How do you, how do you, how do you do it? You've already pushed every boundary. You've proven yourself to every demographic from 10 to 80 Look like. What else is there for Beyonce to do? And that's what I think they started, started challenging themselves and we started dissing them when they started to try to go do other shit. Experimental shit. Yeah. Like I've already mastered this over here. Right. Like I know kung fu so let me go try some other martial art shit to go, you know what I'm saying? And we diss em. Yo, they, they went away from fam I did This shit to death. Yeah. But dissing this part. So that pop, So the pop shit that she did the last time, I like that. I didn, I was sweating that shit. I didn love that shit. I didn't like the, the pop shit. That was my, that was my critique from my last album. Oh, I love that Album.


That album was crazy for me. It was too much of it. That's why I like the deluxe though. It's not as much of it on there. I'm not mad at experimenting, you know, taking a step over here, trying something different, but still give me, I'm one of the fans that I want what I became a fan of. Okay. So don't, don't isolate me by completely experimenting and going over there. Like I still want it to be majority of what I'm here for. If you can do the extra shit, I'm cool with that. But like for me, I like it sprinkled in. I see it from both sides. I see it from both angles. He not wrong. 'cause yo dog, if I'm buying your album, I'm assuming that I'm getting this because this is what your brand is. Them fucking flutes.


That's why they put that. It gotta be look. But if, if, if I mastered this, like y'all saying, if I already mastered this and I did it to death and artistically I'm over here. Right. If you're a fan ride ride with me over here, I'm not mad at, but See that I, I disagree with that because if you are a fan, I said I see both sides because I don't to be that that, that's stand culture to me where it's like I'm just gonna rock out with whatever you do. You don't like it. That's true. Like you could experiment and do something. I don't think that's stand culture. You can experiment and do something and I not like it. That's true. A thousand percent. So I don't have to ride with that. That's true. I agree with that. Spending my money on This. But my experimentation is going to eventually lead to a different sector of greatness.


Then I'll take that. Niggas Dis niggas diss the shit outta eight Oh eights. I remember that. I remember niggas diss that shit. They did. They hated that shit. But what Kanye is different. What happens is people diss him because they No, I wasn't talking to none of them people. They don't really know what would expect with him. Them People were stupid early. No, hold up for a minute because I don't give a fuck. Niggas were, maybe it was niggas dis in 8 0 8, They, yo they hated that Shit. Y'all was dumb early. It was early signs that 8 0 8 was about to do something different. Bro. Niggas hated that shit. Niggas absolute nigga hated that shit, bro. Absolutely hated it. I must have been one of them at first. I, I, I didn't at first I didn.


I Very quickly started seeing them. Call it a classic. Yeah, It turned quick, it Turned fast. It did that one. And for me, last train of Paris, when I first heard it, I was like, ah, this is not, I'm cool. And years later it was like, oh my God, This shit is amazing. Mm. So it happens sometimes. Yeah. Like so, but I don't think none of this, the LANA Deluxe thing, I don't think any of this really pertains to I I don't think she was particularly No, No, I'm just saying and and just, I'm sorry to bring it back around. Back to back to the long album. It just felt, it felt like demos. Yeah. Like even to the fact that like it really sounds like they had the same reverb and EQ on everything and just left it. What do you think the purpose of the release was?


I think that They do have a tour coming up. So I mean that maybe part of the inspiration. Well CSA if I remember correctly, had been promoting the r and b portion of a deluxe for a year. Yeah. She has been talking about it for a while. I think that she was working on this maybe very early in the year, heard the euphoria, beat playing distant from another room and walked over there and quickly saw that Kendrick had a plan for the year. And it probably made some sense. I'm freestyling right now.


Don't think I spoke to somebody and got this. I just think she heard something, went in there, seen a man on a mission and was like, eh, you know what? You Got it. Let me hold up. Lemme go. Got it. Because the timing couldn't be any better. The streets is now asking for a Kendrick and Ss a ep. Yeah, yeah. Joint project. But I mean, you said the timing couldn't be any better. I mean they told us at the top of the year with that list that everybody that was dropping, Yeah. TDE took the year And I came in here and said, I don't believe that shit. I know. And then they called me And I came back and said, Oh Shit y'all, hey, I owe y'all an apologies mad Calls for This shit that I said no for real, for that.


Get my head stumped. That's A call for that. But saying, I don't believe You. Yes. Well I'm glad my people's over there and called me. Good. No, fuck me, fuck my Good because I that I didn't even think that was bad. But yeah, didn didn't, I didn't believe it. But they've dropped everything this year. Yeah. That they said they were gonna drop and she was on the list. How do we feel about the ru the rumored punch? Scissor split? I'm saying rumor because I don't know it to be a fact. Yeah. It's been a bunch of cryptic tweets and Instagram posts. I'm not, do think they followed each other? Does that, I think this is all Market like an indication. I think that's all marketing. Why? What's just to, just to get talk, keep talk going.


That's it. Same way they do the, I used to always say that when the artists start beefing with one of them punch because they want a release date, they know the release date already. Let's get on the internet, let's get the people talking. She said something, I saw them tweet, she put the text convo up, she wanted to put out more music and he rep, he responded and said, oh let's, let's let this breathe for a minute. Let's wait till Christmas or New Year's or something. So to get people saying more music is coming again. Like he was like, ah ya. Yeah. Yeah. Like I'm, they don't, they move too militant and secretive for just, I assume anything that ever hits the blogs or social media from anybody directly there, It is deliberate.


It is a plan. It's deliberate. They just don't move that way. Ain't nobody running they mouth over here. Ain't nobody really venting against them like that. Or except one person. But you see what happened. So I think all of this is part of marketing for them. They sit back and even if drop the beef, I would, I would agree With you. And even if it's not, It's solid niggas over there. Even if it's like real, that doesn't tell me what's to come. Like it normally would in a artist management split when they said that Ken Kendrick was leaving TDE, the internet was all in a fuss. And we've seen nothing but Kendrick, right. TDE ever Since Fa Family Unity. So yeah, our paperwork might say that we done right now, but our blood and our history and I couldn't even see how that would, would make sense for Cism.


Now granted, there are some people that feel like, oh, I wanna flourish. I'm like, oh no, it's been long enough. So I get that. But s CSA is creme de la creme top of the top. Top. Yeah. They did it. They did. And whether you fought with Punch or did not the whole way through, y'all did it. So even if this is over for real, what does that mean? How could you be at that? Right. Your next run. I could see you calling the guy that helped And them helping And them helping. I could see that happening. Even if you were completely knocked there anymore. I could see them they got, So I don't know shit about shit, but I know like Ice just finished saying everybody over there comes off as a standup person.


So I don't think it'll be the normal, the normal Hoo and Annie. I Agree. See if this was another label, I'd have totally different thoughts on a lot of this. Right. Like even the LANA album dropping as the SOS deluxe. And I think I touched on that when we did the Patreon. I was looking at that. You touched On that Pause. I was looking at that. Like, that was weird to me because this is a whole new album. Yeah, yeah. But you tied it to this, to your 2-year-old album as a deluxe. Mm. So I'm like, was that the middle ground? Okay, you wanna put more music out Fine. But you got one album. I don't, I'm I'm freestyling too.


You got one album left. This is not gonna count as your one album. So we'll let you put it out as the deluxe. So it, it could be that it's still SOS you still owe us a project. We still got work to do. But that's the way you'll get this album out. I could see that if this were another label. 'cause I, like I said, I've, I've talked to artists that were down to that last album trying to get the album out and the label say no, No, we Not drop, we're not dropping until we renegotiate for two more albums. Right. And if you don't wanna renegotiate, we don't drop this album. Yeah. So Listen, scissor, big Jersey. Oh that. I look forward to whatever she's doing next. I am enjoying the, even if It is a bunch of demos, I No, I Still Love it.


Like I said, she, I love This shit. She's playing shit Will making bad music. She's fucking in there killing vocal runs. The melodies are incredible. All that shit is great. It just feels half cooked compared to the standard that she has set for herself. Yeah, I, I would agree with that's all. I would agree with that. Or maybe that's why it's the deluxe. Maybe we are not gonna make this a standalone be if it's this Yeah. It could be that. Yeah. Yeah. You know what I mean? We'll attach it over here so it lives under this project. Yeah. Somebody over there call call me and tell me everything we wrong about Oh no. They gonna call you. That's how podcasters get information now, just by saying the wrong shit publicly. Yo dog, you was wrong. This is really what it was. Okay. Oh, thanks. And then, and Don't, don't say nothing though. Tuesday. It'll be be lovely.

Here's my final rag on mail question for you. And then we could talk about Beyonce. I went home and thought long and hard about your billboard inquiry. I'm asking one question and I'm leaving it alone forever. Oh my God. Go, go Ahead. I watched it back like 90 times. That was a great episode. She a classic. Should have went triple. Yeah. She was cooking. No, that was one of the best episodes ever. Shout, shout. She was out bag. Yeah. Nah, you smoke bad.


But everything you was saying to me in regards to the billboard, ain't that the same shit that Redacted was saying to you? No. Do you remember what one of my points was? Hello? Hello? She talking, she talking to you big Dog. I said two words. It's over now. I said two very important words. No, I'm done now. Yeah. I said two very important words. What? Sweat equity. And speaking of sweat equity, Beyonce, man. Whoa. What Beyonce, what a Super Bowl for?


It wasn't the Super Bowl. You motherfucker, boy. Did anyone here? CB Oh I did, for sure. Yeah. My whole whole house. We don't wanna start with the bullshit. Mariah pulled, What'd she do? She did the Christmas song, which was lit. Like it was great. It was great production there on top of like a, a skyscraper decked all the way out. But I was just like, you're not gonna go to the game and do it at the game. Like that's, it's pre prerecorded. Clearly It's Mariah. I know, but that's takes the fun out it for You. Not not coming to your Football game, not coming to your, You're your little What's Where is this Little game that you Texas?


No, no, no. Yeah. Won't be. I'm Mariah Carey and y'all are y'all. I'm gonna do it here. And y'all gonna take this Video, Be Happy. No. Take this fire stick. Load it up. There you go. As soon as you plug it in I'm gonna gonna pop right up. It's right there. And do my numbers. That's It. Yeah. Sorry Roger. So Roger probably fucked his name. Rock. Jerry. Jerry. Jerry. Yeah. I don't wanna start with this. I mean, I What do y'all, what do you, what do y'all think about? I don't, I don't wanna come off like, but Well I hated that I had to watch the Ravens game to get that after us losing.


Mm. So I really did not. But again, my whole, the entire house is Bee h for sure. That shit was on like four TVs. Yeah. So I, I loved it. I liked how she had the black country start. Like this is some black shit. It was, yeah. Blackity. Black. Black, black shit. Yeah. So I like how that's her, like, that's their thing and they, her and Ho and they kind of make sure to throw that in your face every chance they get. So I, I like that part. Yeah. Song selection. I'm still not a fan of the country album. I like that shit. So I Like the album. I was glad when Texas Hold came on, we was all, all right. This is my shit right now. Let's go. Go out in the bang. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. But other than that and it was great to see her and Blue up there together.


That shit was that shit. That was cute. Yeah, That was cute. I'm not going that as a dude. I you shouldn't think that. That shit put that out. Dope. So that's my takes on it though. Yo, you're homeboy, you is His eyes glazing over? I'm, I'm good. I can't See him from here. I'm trying to just listen to the takes. You Can't, you can't possibly have a bad take. I gave you my take already, which is when you're the pinnacle of greatness. It's just tough to exceed that, that That is my take. Like I felt what y'all are saying about her and Blue, the 9 million times I've seen her and Blue on stage. They Showed the, they showed The I I saw the show the, I saw the show with all the everybody.


Water, aluminum foil. Shit. I saw Coachella, I saw this, I saw when HBO came out super like I've seen it. She's great. She's great. I feel like once I see it, I don't think anything new is happening to where I need a new take on a Beyonce show. Looks like a Beyonce show to me now. Yeah, Good point. That's sad Content to that Level Of desensitization. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. That the greatness is just the bar. So. Yeah, exactly. It's kind of like you unappreciated, We've been great for long enough, right? Like LeBron played the other night without mad people on his team had like 39, 15 boards. It's like, yo dog, how old are you again?


Like oh alright. This is just the level, this is just the level that Beyonce is at the level. It's a short list of people that's at that level very short where you expect that It is very short. That that's what you expect. So she gonna have to figure out, she gotta go, I wanna see Beyonce in the Vegas fear. I can't, that will be that I wanna see, I want to see Beyonce on the shuttle to Mars or some shit. Like you gotta do something different. Yeah man, astronaut's been stuck out there for nine months. Got like go perform on Jupiter. Go get the mark dog. The, the, the greatness is greatness. Right. But you can tell that the whole crew, them niggas was moving like fucking Rhythm Nation up there bitch.


Oh for sure. You don't remember how Janet Jackson, all them niggas was in like, that shit looked like Thriller. Like they was total, that shit is total sink. Like that shit is crazy. And it's always impressive. Look, I'm not even trying to be horny, yo. She looks me. No I'm not trying. Looks amazing. My nigga, she looked amazing. Get horny on these nigga. Good. She started to, you know, get a little, little, little plump. She you mean after she had two babies she scaled that shit. Yo she looks fucking amazing. B she does she does she look like she 22 or 23 again? Nah, it was just, it was an amazing performance. Everybody's saying Kendrick got his work cut out on form. Stop it. I don't, no I'm just saying I just think it's two totally different. No. Yeah, totally different. No I think it's two totally different things.


I think's Apples That the internet people be in there. You we're gonna just, we Got it. He got his work Cut out. Nah, I think he gonna, I think they vetted well. Yeah, I think he, they Gone and Kendrick also get up there and start getting in. Don't let him get in Rhythm Nation back. Like he, I'm not comparing him to Beyonce. No he could. I said he know How to put, he know how to put a show on. Actually that's the point that when we was talking about Drake and the stadium versus Arena and yada yada yada. Granted maybe he could fill out a fucking, he could Stadium A stadium. But a lot of people that went to the show is like, I don't know if that's a stadium show. I don't think he has a stadium. That whole Karaoke put the mic out, walked back and forth on the huge square.


It is just not a stadium show. So Kendrick, we've seen, I'm not worried about what It's a lot involved in the stadium show bro. It's, It is not the same. It's levels bro. I just watched, I was watching a bunch of them clips from Chris Brown going over to to Africa. Africa doing that show Stadium. I was just about to say Jay-Z, whoever the fuck gotta get over it, my Nigga, I was looking for the after party photos and picks and bigs. They had them. They had em, they had You. Right. They ain't come across. They ain't come across my feed. Yeah, but No Jay-Z and them, whoever the fuck is out here picking the people, they gotta get his boy his shot. 'cause I think he, after watching Beyonce get up there and get busy, the only other person I'm like yo, they gotta get this nigga Chris Brown shot never happens And no, no I don't think he give a fuck either.


I don't, I don't either. If he, if he could just gonna go figure out How new other ways To be Seen. Yeah. I could just go do it then family, he only lying around that African arena like a jet pack was on his ass. Yeah. So it was 90,000 people in there two nights in a row back to back, back to back nights. Wow. I don't know what kind of cameras Netflix had, but the game looked a little different. Did he?

Yeah I would. Of course. A thousand percent. Thousand percent. Do y'all think that Netflix, halftime Christmas performances becomes a thing.


They Can do it like that the next two years. The next two years I think will determine who they, who they go get and what the level of performance is for the next two people. Do Y'all think that Netflix continues to deal with, continues this deal with the NFL? Yes. Yes. Yes. Absolutely. Those numbers. Netflix is looking to move into the, the lot like they got, they got wrestling starting And paid a grip for wrestling. Yep. They got wrestling starting January In the billions. Yeah. Really? Yeah. How many years? 5 billion. I, I don't know how many multi-year? I don't remember. I'm not looking it up. Multi-year. $5 billion deal. Something crazy like that. The NFL for one day got a hundred to 150 million for, for for the day B day package.


And that's the thing like they what it's the the holiday remix shit For the day for those games for the day. I need a hundred to $150 million. Sheesh. And they ran ads. Yeah, Well that's why they did the deal. Yeah. No, no, no. I get it. I get it. 'cause you ain't no telling what they went and charged him ass for with them numbers. I think they're fine. You don't, you don't. I think they're fine. I just think that's they gonna have to pay it like they weigh it. Yeah they are. They'll pay it. But you know what people don't. What McCullough was crazy when he Was doing that. Put Squid Games two Right up midnight the Day before. No, midnight before the day after. Right, right after James. Oh really? Yeah. Squid games.

Beautiful Nini on, on Instagram transition passed away a couple days before Christmas.


Yeah. My heart, my heart aches for these Christmas deaths. Yeah. One any holiday shits. Yeah, But two, I mean it's not, I don't know, I don't know all the details of it, but if what I'm hearing is true, I hate you Niggas out. Y'all are pieces of shit. Like she was a mother, like she was a mom with young kids with Christmas approaching it. It is selling vapes with fentanyl in it. Really? That's nuts. That's nuts. Shees. Yo, I can't even imagine. I can't even imagine going to buy a vape. Like just to vape word and it's fentanyl. I don't even understand what the purpose is of that. Yeah, yeah. Like I don't, how would you put it in this?


It is devious, bro. Fuck that. But what's is it? But what does that gain? I was about to say you financially. I mean if I had to, if I had to answer, I mean my vape is littered in somebody else's. I don't think it's worth it. I hope that they find if, if that story is true, I hope they, I'm 100% healthy. Find the person responsible. Hell yeah. For some That's crazy with fentanyl. And get them to fuck off the streets, man. Yeah, yeah. Rest in peace. Rest In, rest In peace for sure. Also wanna say rest in peace to OG Michael. Oh yeah, I saw that. Yeah. They put out a family, it was a rumor going around before, but about an hour ago, the family put out a statement and said, you know, that he did pass.


Damn. So I send a rest in peace to him as well. Rest in peace. Mm. Rest in peace to anybody we lost during the holidays. And hold your head to anybody out there that may be going through a dark time during this holidays. Depression is up, crime is up. Everything is up. That's not lost on any of us. So Yeah. Prayers, prayers, prayers. Thousand percent For sure. How y'all feel about this Jay-Z Busby. Shit. That's an interesting turn of developments. Yeah. What happened recently? Because I've heard some more stuff about Busby himself. Like that was the main dude leading the charge against Deshaun. Oh really? Yes. Wow. They said that was the attorney that was on a Deshaun Watson shit.


Old ass snap facts nigga. That came out weeks ago. We haven't potted about it. We said that. No, I don't think we did. Didn didn't. No we didn't. No we didn't. 'cause Parks just said that was news that Got It. Yeah. Nigga. No, he's stupid. That's okay. I'll take that. I'll wear That. That's Fine. Yeah. But how do we feel about it? Apparently they went to court. The judge said that Jay-Z will not expedite the judicial process. They allowed for the victim to remain anonymous and apparently had some words for Shapiro Alex Shapiro ho's attorney and said that all your tricks are not gonna work or something to that effect.


Mm. So small win for Busby at the moment, but long game. Yeah. I, I think it's telling that Jay got on the offensive. Why? Because most times these people don't get on the offensive. They play, they play the defense now. It's like, yo dog, you're trying to slander my name now I'm gonna come for your jugular. I think it's a little different. Yeah. And I think that's where this win came from, is that he's pushing very hard to get Yes. What he wants immediately. And So from what I heard, again, again from what I heard, Jay was the first person to sue Busby months ago. Jay's name was never in that suit.


The 13-year-old shit was ver via versus Puff. So then Why was he Sue? They came to him. They came to him and tried to say, yo, we'll include you in the suit. We want some Spanky. And he was like, suck my dick. And then they said that Jay went and put a suit on Busby. So his 13-year-old shit is a counterclaim or in retaliation to the suit that Jay-Z put forth on him months ago. I heard that's that's a, I think We talk about, but it's a little No, I told You that. We did. But y'all told me shut up. So fuck y'all. No, he did talk about that part. I mean We talk about this part here too. It was, he was, his name wasn't in there. He was unnamed. Yes. Like, we'll, you know, we went to you, we talked to you a demand letter with demand.


We sit down and talk about this and they told him, told him, fuck outta here. And for even coming to me with the demand letter, I'm gonna sue you. Yes. Which from what I've read, a demand letter is normal. Gotcha. It's a part of any civil, you know, before we get there, the first thing I wanna do is let you know, Hey dog, I have something that we can settle this, we can settle this. Do you not even settle? Do you want to have a conversation about this or not? And then how you proceed is, will dictate how I proceed. Gotcha. So you proceed. Oh, suck my dick. All right, well now I'm gonna go suck my dick and here go a suit. Yeah, I'm gonna go to the courts. I do think, I think this is gonna be a long fight.


I'm with ho getting on the offensive. If I know for a, a fact I didn didn't do none of that shit. Certainty y'all on some bullshit. Don't put my name in this. And, and I understand them trying to expedite it like, yo dog, I want to clear my name as soon as possible. Let's go. I want to, I want This shit because again, this is, this could have to potential to affect a lot. Yeah. So I want my name cleared tomorrow, nigga. My wife and daughter just performed yesterday. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like, yo dog, get that shit outta here. It's, and I would, I wouldn't spare any expense. Yeah. It's just interesting that this was the judge's take on everything considering the interview that just happened on NBC. You know, like where the victim was, had all her facts wrong.


Like significant facts. So just interesting that this is the direction that the Judge said. Yeah. But having your facts wrong on NBC is different than having your facts wrong in the court of law. That's one. And it's still due process. It's still, you can't, because you're Jay-Z and you are a billionaire, you still can't jump the line in the court system. That that's what, that's what the judge is saying. So I'm not in disagreement with that. I'm not in disagreement with that. I don't see it as judge's. A big win for Buzzby is everyone pushing it. It is just the judge saying, yo dog, we not play. We going through out Play out. Yeah. We're playing this out. You ain't special nigga. You a you a citizen. Right. And to the part about her facts being wrong, like she said, she had talked to a couple of the members of the band was, I think it was good Charlotte it see, and then it came out where it's just a year was wrong.


And I'm listen, give, let's just say it's some other shit. That was, that was question. No, I'm, I'm just saying some of the things that were pointed wrong, because she said it was the 2000 VMAs, I think it was like the 2002 VMAs, all of that shit with track. So it's like they, if they got the year wrong, we don't know. But again, let This Shit play out for, for the next season of America. Yeah. Word. Oh, the 2025 version of America. It is This shit about to be is on the way in the trailer is crazy. Starts in January. Yeah. This shit is better than Game of Thrones. Starts in January. That teaser right there.

He said you wasn't doing Yeah, he just dropped it today. Okay. I didn't get a chance to listen yet, but he just jumped out there early and was like, yeah, you ready? I'm back. Did a 2024 wrap up.

Put out Luxe V Rom rom on YouTube. I I would suggest everybody go take a gander at that one. When's that from? A few months ago. Okay. A few months ago. And they just been keeping it in The top. Maybe a little more than that.


Well, yeah, smack has his subscription service. He has his Zap U-R-L-U-R-L tv. I Would be glad to see more stuff on YouTube from them. Like I don't keep up with the battle scene as much. 'cause the app, I never had a great experience With it. Yeah. I didn't like the app at all. So I loved it. And I get it like get your money, but like put it out for the rest of us. At some point When they were on caffeine, it was great. Yeah, because you could just watch. It was, but I, I don't like their app. Yeah. On the re, on the rewatch I probably have Rum two one. I don't know if I felt that way when it aired. But on the rewatch, those guys, those guys are incredible. Those guys. Both of 'em.


Yes. Those guys are absolutely incredible. What Rum and Lux did up there? I just probably give it to Rum Nitty because you had to deal with Lux like our, again, back to my greatness argument. Lux for to me is already what he is. Anytime he stand in front of one of you niggas, he's just giving y'all a shot. Yeah. For you to be great there. There's nothing, Nothing left to prove. Nothing left to do. He did it already. Mo like I, I mean I I made me biased. I say the same thing about my brother. There's nobody left for you to battle. When I, when we be talking battles, like you've battled the top of the top. You've battled the newcomers, you've battled the women greats. You, you just battle in the battle at this point.


Like You have nothing Was bugging. Actually he said fold them in front of the kids. Balloon animals. Nah, he said so much shit. I'm gonna, I'm gonna watch. He said so much shit that if you enjoy lyricism, That is the battle to watch. Phenomenal job. Round of applause for those brothers. Dumb niggas bogged out. I wouldn't Y any prediction on next month's battle? Who's battling Suge and Easy? I don't care about it. Okay. I don't care about it. I fuck with Suge Big Jersey. But they not, I'm not, I can't Got it. I can't. I cannot do it. They leaking something now. They say Remy is? Yeah. They did a face off.


They did a face off. I don't, I can't even, I love Remy so there's nothing for me to say. My, ain't nothing for me to say. But the rule that they talking about being implemented that no battle rapper could talk about. I, I ain't take it that way. She was saying like, yo nigga ain't gonna, it ain't gonna be no shots at me. 'cause nigga I shoot back, I don't forget. I rap like that's what she was telling Suge. She's like, I rap. She's like, actually I have a high success rate of shooting first. Like she was playing into. I don't think it's a, a real rule where can't nobody say Nothing to her. I hope it's not, I don't think, I don't even think she would do that given the Geechee shit. 'cause it when it was hot you would've had that rule then.


No, that not true. That would be what made me come up with my rule. I didn't know you battle rappers was about to go this crazy over my personal business in any league of mine, I'm not allowing it. I don't know if that's true or not. So we'll see. But, And on the hills of what has taken place, like it wasn't as prevalent back then. I don't publicly, I don't really wanna see easy now that's me personally. I'm not saying that he ain't been on a hell of a run. That he is not nice that he, but I don't, I can't. Not right now. Not, not right now. I don't like, I don't like it. I don't like it. I'm cool.


I Got it. But shout to them. What else? Is there anything else we need to need to hit? Anything important? Unimportant? Come on. I, there's gotta be something we, I know.
