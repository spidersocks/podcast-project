This is one of those things, this is one of those things where battle rap being such a huge fan of battle rap really helps my podcasting abilities because I know that the feeling in the room may be different. Would they want the playback than the feeling on the playback?


That's a fact. So that's how we beat them. We walked right into a male trap about dudes lying on their dicks. Yes, we Did. Lying on their cocks. And I fucking had a slice with that topic, nigga. We had a whole cake And, and yeah, flip had a slice with that topic too. Yeah. Y'all dragged you a little bit here. We went to Marcus, but we had so much fun. Yeah, okay. Parks, you jumped in too. I did, I did. For sure. Middle at least fell us. We were right. No, the thing is, is like we, we ended it and then went right back to it and Mel be looking a little flustered. So when we having a slice fast and Mel looks flustered. Nope nigga, I went home dog pile Mel and then everyone dog pile.


I call flipping seven 30 in the morning. He starts telling me some of the things we said. But I mean, I did admit that I was the CA little triggered. The community was already mad about my chicken joke. Facts. They were extremely mad. Oh my God, I missed that one. If they was mad at my chicken joke, They were mad because, Oh, that Patreon effort, When I said, would you be kinder to the guy? Well I think I said kinder. They don't think I, they think I was implying something else. Mm. I When I say, would you be kinder to the guy that fucking, that you had a rapport with that's already in your life. That would pay you rent for like the next few months. And he was like, oh, I don know if I could accept And it like the chicken got it done, but got it done. Meaning you was kinder to the guy that fucking made some jerk chicken.


But that's not how they Took it. Yeah, you're right. Yeah. They took that like I fucked for chicken. Whoa. Yes. Yeah. Real fucked for chicken is crazy. That's, it's coming across. By no means would I ever sit on this couch and imply that I would not even employ Melyssa Ford if I believed that she was fucking for chicken. I promise you. Thank you. I promise you I would not. I appreciate that. I swear to God. What about a to hall? Thank God No nigga. No I, I'm just saying you Did that. I'm just asking what you Sorry Ninja. No, I know who Melyssa Ford is. Me too.

When, you said thinks she is. Do you think that she thinks she's higher than Melyssa Ford? Do you think she thinks she's, Oh, I didn't get into the higher lower game. Okay. Please don't.

And then I checked my phone to see if I followed some nigga named Mikey And I didn't. And I said oh he was fucked from the start. He ain't stand a chance. If Michael Ely was Mikey, that brought me to topic three when friends missed their opportunity to fuck each other. And now we're stuck in the friendship. If y'all don't wanna say nothing on this one, I understand. I'll keep going.

I, I agree a little bit. I totally agree. And Just a little bit, bit like Michael Eley came in and he flexed. He sunned him. Yeah, he really little. Because even after he hugged her, he put her down.

Yeah, why you say that? Who? Nvidia Pfizer coming out with they with their weight loss score by the way. Yeah. Yo. Because maybe at some point you thought that you standing next to him before the verdict came in.

I know y'all felt good going home when the video came out of him running away from the white girl, y'all high five, y'all had to drink that night and now quiet. He is getting movies. Don't make me say it. No, don't make me say it. Little Bitcoin, he's getting movies don't make good for him. Little Dip. His stock is down. Is what you're Basically saying is I'm, am I the only one here that says it? No you're not. Because y'all like to do that a lot. No, no, no. You're not his stock. Mel Ford is his stock not down.


What I'm seeing right now is I'm watching her do a lot of interviews. Melyssa Ford. Yeah. Let her answer you. Let her answer no dog. What I'm seeing is I'm seeing her being a lot more vocal about this relationship. you know what I'm saying? And she's going on record talking about how everybody in her life told her to not get into this relationship and she followed her heart and she listened to God and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So she's really doubling down on this is my man, my man, my man. This is where I'm staying. This is what this is When. you see until that nigga walk in a room. Hmm? You didn't answer the question at all. At all. I didn answer the question at all. Is his stock down go According to who though?


That's what I'm Who do you say? Oh shit, P is tired of it called God Melyssa. Is this stock down? No, I think it's kind of like, it's a, it's a waiting game right now. It kind is. It it Steal me. It's leveled out. Okay. It's leveled out and, and And It leveled out from where? It was undulating a Lot. Undulating. It was undulating way outta this shit. Oh my God. It wasn't undulating. There was a lot of ugly at one. Shit was going up. He was going up. He was Sam nigga was on a meteoric rise. Yes. And then that nigga got that shit happened. His stock is in the gutter, my nigga. Okay. Not in the gutter issue, I Don't think. No. However, we do know Deadline and Variety just posted that he's got a new movie in the works with a really big director.


So what's the Name of it? I can't remember what the name is. It Ain't Kang It. I know it's not Kang. I'm not doing a comparison between the two. But he's gotta start somewhere. And really, honestly, I didn't see anybody but Tyler Perry wanting to touch him. But The stock at close Tyler. I understand. But she knew what she was getting. 'cause she got it when the stock was plummeted. You gotta buy low. Huh? You gotta buy low Sometimes. That part, you know when the market bottoms out, that's When you start to buy. So you do feel like his stock Profile, his stock, his stock plummeted. We all, we all know that that court case, that shit hurt him drastically. Yes. That's tough. Hey, here's another one that I'm gonna just throw out there not to get.


These are all colors. I, I'm gonna throw another pair. Get these not to be messy and not to be nosy. I don't know that John de Majors and Megan Good is fucking What? I don't know that Jonathan Majors and Megan Good are having sexual intercourse. Are you saying that from, they were already recorded on the carpet doing that weird ass kiss like they had never kissed before and they're not used to none of this. And the way that she responded in that hug to me, to Joseph Anthony Button Jr. I'm not trying to change none of y'all minds out there about shit.


She responded like a woman. Yes. That one. you know, you know what I'm saying? But I'm gonna say it and I'll take the E for it too. Glad. Thank you. She responded like, thank you. She responded like a woman that has been without the physical touch that her body yearns a little pent up. Yes. Little pent up. And if there was anybody that qualified for this wild theory, it's Megan Good. Who was just with a dude for a decade without fucking Wait, wait, wait. What you talking about? What you Talking about her husband Before Jonathan Majors. That guy. Yes. They wasn't fucking, But they, yeah, they were together for man Without fucking, they, they didn't fuck until they got married. But that was for years.


They practiced abstinence until they got married. Which Was for years. It wasn't like years, it was years they was doing interviews. Like, no, we're still going strong. It was like a year and a half. She should know. That's still more than A year. Okay. That's still more than a year. But then they were married for like however long And they were fucking, I'm not dis Meg, but, but then even when she was with the preacher dude, she still went on the same public crusade. you know what I'm saying? She was doing interviews about how it's the most fulfilling ever and all of that other shit too. Okay. Well, you know, times change. People change, you know. So at the moment when she's having the interview, maybe she was fulfilled and then the marriage changed. No, no, no, no. I'm just saying. But you Know, you discover you want different things.


Hold it in, hold it in. You want hold it in. Breathe. Stretch, shake, let it go. Like Mee said, breathe, stretch, shake, let it go. Oh Man. Oh yeah. That's when he was on Fab Ass.

If he don't do that. Can't. That's true. That's true. Yeah. Fab. I ain't moving on. Mother. Back, back to Jonathan Major. Anybody having any, any more words on this? I feel like this is just great. I can go on with this for, for fucking ever. Do you think that friends should, so earlier you responded and said that, fuck it, it don't matter because they were together for such a short time. Michael Eley had every right to hug her the way he did. That's Michael Eley was going to hug her exactly like that. Especially if his name is Mikey. Especially if we did movies together, especially if we missed each other.

Play the Clip. We Find it. She said something to the effect of what we learned recently is nobody, nobody better come for Kendrick Lamar. But don don't necessarily know if that's a Drake shot or just, she Also said Drake's name. He's gonna find it. Well while we on the subject of Drake. I see you flip What? I See the sweatpants. I see what they are. The name right there. Oh. JR put me onto this man. He told me OI Bet OV When. I went to the store.


The guy that looked Oh you Went went to the store. So you went to the to the OVO store. O store. No, no. It's something called Butters and and Queens. And he told me Yo, the podcasts gonna be mad, Joe gonna be mad at you. I'm like Joe not gonna be mad. I wear this. Swear to God. He told me that. They told me in the store. I said I like them shit. Do a little strong Jay Strip. Who did they think I am? don don't know. I get mad at you wearing sweats. The nigga said that. He says a fan of the show and he said Yo, you know Joe and them not gonna like that. He was joking but 'cause JR told me this is Drake's joint. Yeah. Yeah it is. This is Line but night. I never heard of it before. I just like it. This Is line with night? No, the other day I was somewhere and I seen seen somebody. I know When I fucking gave, gave a a pound and a hug.


That nigga was smelling good. Hey what the fuck you got on? That's, that's all I tried to guess. He was like nah. Oh shit. That was Drusky. Yeah, he was like nah this is the Dre cologne. Fuck damn. I just, all right nigga. He said nah, you ain't got a bottle. I said well I sided. I sided with the way my account is set up. PG Lang sided with Kendrick. So just don't worry about it. Probably probably won't get one Of those though. That shit Smell. Ain't no nigga had no cologne. Nigga that money out here nigga got Cologne. You gonna go get it. It's cool though. You wanna wear Drake cologne?


I wouldn't tell nobody. It's D Drake Cologne. So you'll wear it but you wouldn't Got it. Fuck the fuck Are you talking about Why though? Don't tell me why. No, no not falling for your little pocket. I was just asking why I don't even have no tricks though. Because I said no and I stand on that. All right. That's it. But you tell people with other cologne, you louisie. That's not really true either. Outside of him. I don't outside tell people the cologne I got on as So would you tell him this Yo, this Drake cologne. Oh I would tell him. You ain't tell me all. Don't tell him that. If I'm outside and somebody ass, I'm smelling good now. No I ain't saying that nigga. I don't do that Shit no more. Neither. Ain't no fucking promo. And I'm a lie And I don't want you. It's gonna be like when they used to ask me for directions back in the day.


Oh yeah you one of them. I was definitely one. I ain't know where the fuck I'm sitting. Yeah, yeah up. See that light light up there. Go straight down. Make a right Niggas. Right. The Dunking project I don. Where the fuck niggas be at? Yo. I definitely did that. Yo remember having to ask for directions. I had somebody, shit MapQuest Map asked me for directions to West New York. I didn't know West New York was in Jersey. MapQuest was privileged at one point Before that. No nigga it was Map. Yeah. Yeah. Niggas should have maps in they car. Yeah. A real big paper map. That big ran McNally shit. Thats book ran McNally.


That's crazy. I told you I was on map. I do have this clip if you guys wanna hear it. Yeah, let's that for him. But I've learned anything this year is that none of us, not a single one of us, not even me should ever pick a fight with Kendrick Lamar. They Not like us. They not like us. They not like us. Do little dance. you know what I mean? He'll make your hometown not like you. The next time Drake sits court side at a Raptors game, they're gonna force Gump. Him sights Tyson. They not like us. They not like us. They not like us. I think this is cheesy I think that certain award shows trying to get in on culture related topics may come off cheesy.


But I'm not mad at Serena doing it because it's payback for that shit. You said about my husband that was unwarranted. So any chance I get I'm shooting at you So I understand both sides. It is still. It is. I mean make a better joke. Like whoever wrote it wasn't that's it was my only thing. I'm not mad at her getting shit Off. Maybe She didn't Feel like the punch was her doing the dance. That's What it was. Not so much in the, and the Tom Hanks joke is like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Better joke would've went over better. And I think the svs be on it anyway. On what? Like current Hip hop shit. They try to in incorporate it a little bit into into the shows, into the skit and Jokes. Did we not get a picture of Drake and Wayne from the Michael Rubin party?


Wayne said that only one person came to Speak to him. I think it was Gorilla. He said Gorilla was the only person that came To Yeah, that's why I thought of that. Yeah, because he made it a point to say that. Yeah, I agree. Only one person spoke to him. He said only Glo only Gorilla came. He Said only Gorilla really spoke to me. So I take that to mean like only Gorilla maybe had a conversation with conversation with me. I'm sure somebody said hi to Little Wayne. Yeah. Said well of course. But that's odd. That's very odd. Super odd. That's odd. I believe it alone now, but There's more there. Just something I thought about moving on. Any, any other takeaways from the sbs? Nah, Nah. Salute.


Salute, salute. Jalen Brown. Jalen Brown. He walked in. He made his red carpet debut. No. don don't know if it was his debut. Well, but he won the award. That's what they're claiming. Might not have been a debut, but he won the award. Walked in.

Before this woman that y'all are clip riding, he was with another woman and that woman cleared the gym out when she worked out. Facts. See This is another one of those topics that I talk used to talk about all the time up here.


What y'all do when the two rappers are in the studio together, it's easy as a fan to sit on Twitter and say Yo Fab is trash fab is a bum, but When you a rapper and fab is coming to the studio to get on your song and walk in the booth and you gotta deal with this in real time. Now that could be problematic before this young lady y'all are talking about, he was with someone that could appear to be problematic if you thought you was cute and seen her in person. Who he was with before is absolutely stunning. I did not know his dating history. Okay. So I wasn't thinking about who he was with before. So I did not know That is me not knowing who he was with before. Right. There you go.


Got it. I have always said that she is a stunning, beautiful woman. Now there's a fight here. 'cause I'm really not. This wasn't for Me and you This was for me and Ish to fight. Go ahead. This was our fight to have. I love this. I don't know if we could have it. You could. It's Way That's up to him. Oh, I'm ready to dance. He got his glasses on. Yeah. And it. Leg shaking Look, leg shaking. He ready. And it look good. we know what it mean when the legs start shaking y you Stupid. So an intro on you I Think. No, I think intro on you, you him number one. Not too. No, but it started with you. We were saying y'all, we were saying Jalen Brown went to the red carpet with such and such. don don't know her name. It is hard to pronounce.


I'm not trying to be funny. And what was y'all saying? That it was turning head. Oh yeah, y'all was doing the woo. Ah yeah, he stepped on there with ah You mean They look good. Oh look, they Look great. Looked. It was killing. They look good Then I gotta say what I said, Which was I said that that girl almost broke her Hip standing there taking them pictures. She almost threw her whole leg out. She had a very hard time standing up straight. It was a whole lot of posing and angles and curvaceous. you know, you know how to do it on the red carpet. I said, but I waited and I caught her standing up straight.


That's what I said. I thought you number one, not Two. I'm number two. Not one. I'm not at fuck you talking about Go ahead Yt. Say what you said. I just Said what I said Verbatim. You said more than that though. You did say that. You said more than that. I said somebody at home probably feeling crazy 'cause shorty walked in there on the red carpet looking like a monster with the $300 million, man. Alright, Let me get to it man. Respect, respect to this lady. Y'all know what would've happened had he walked in there with Bernice. Now he didn't walk in there with Bernice for his own reasons. don don't know if we had that conversation on our business.


Right? But in the event that he walked in there with Bernice, we know What. Happened And what's that? Onyx shut him down. I don don't know that. I don't know that. Okay. And I think he I don and I know that then I lose. No, no. And I think they shut him down. Okay. You disagree? Yeah. Bernice. Bernice is, Bernice is Bernice. If y'all don't think that Bernice next to him was shutting down the ESPY's red carpet, then then I forfeit. Then I forfeit. Okay. I don't think that she looks stunning though. I'm talking about in terms of her dress, her hair, her, she looks stunning.


And they looked great together. Listen now. And they're both Athletes. So Yeah. In the terms of being at The ESPYs, see that's the fight. That was the real fight at the ESPYs. You with the fucking athlete. And she looked like, who? Gorgeous. This is the look. And then I was gonna retort that with the men, especially $300 million men maybe not giving a fuck about status so much. And maybe being groupies for people. I agree with that. I think that all of, I think a It's tough. You said that we could have it in entertainment And I know you didn't think about it. You just wanted to win Fight. It's tough. No, I'm I'm telling you in in in the entertainment business, I think there are more groupies than we know. Well you, you might know and you might know 'cause you guys have been in with entertainment for 20 years.


So. I. Don't think that's hard pressed. Especially if you bring in somebody like if Jalen Brown, he's what? 26. 26 years old. Some of these people IE my friends be telling me, Yo, you sitting on the couch with Melyssa four. Oh my god. Yo, she was in my room. When I was in the, and When I was in upstate and all the other, this the same effect. Oh, seven Couple niggas said that. Yeah, it is the same effect. We're Bernice. It's the same effect with Drea. It's the same effect. With the same effect with do some right. Do right. What the fuck, Take that out. We don't. And It's not the same. It is. But Yo. So again, all of those don't do that. Yo don't do that. When these people was in high school, when these people was in college, they idolized these women.


They couldn't wait. Oh, that's what you're saying? Yeah, they couldn't wait. Got it. You get what I'm saying? Like that posters on nigga's wall. I don't have none. You don't? Oh, This, that are on posters? No, Halle Berry. Oh, exes. Oh, Got it. Yeah. Yeah. Got it. So to say that JB could have potentially been a groupie for Bernice. don don't think that's farfetched at all. I think she might have been in his bucket list. Both Ladies Are me. Listen, one lady Was stunning. I'm sure the other one would have been stunning. That's, That's what got People, it was just your part about they Would've shut it down. Some nigga shit. People take down people. We doing Nigga, nigga shit off Mike And. it was fun. It Was And. it was fun. You ran Be It ain't gonna be ass fun.


I ain't No no, no, no, nigga. What it was is that it was Corey's psycho ass that was saying bullshit.

What is it? Hip Hop Media personalities this year, unlike last year, I wasn't privy to when the list was dropping.


They did not do a photo shoot. They did not call me to sing my praises and talk to me about all of my accolades that I've accomplished since I left that particular company. Yeah, like they did last year. This year they did not massage me up with loyal. Make me feel good going into the list this year it just dropped and I had no idea. No, They did that to act this year. No, they were, they were genius in doing it. Not only did they do that, but they used some picture from When. I wasn't dressing the greatest. It was a robe that I had on with a fedora. It was bad but I was getting, that's a robe. I was getting money. So I didn't care. Yeah, it was a robe with a like a leopard print lapel.


It was a lot happening in the picture. I feel like companies and And vlogs and vlogs and all these niggas do that on purpose with me because I'm killing. Gotta Bring it down. They can't make it look like I'm killing. So they make me look like A lot of times they, But anyway, so that list came out. I clicked the link. I read number 25 and then I took my big thumb and I wound it up first. And I gave my phone the biggest scroll that my screen protector would allow. 'cause I knew that I wasn't 24 to three and that's a lie to four.


I thought I might have came in three. And if I'm being honest, I do feel like three kind of had an argument for two. Three is Kai sonnet. Two is Joe button, one is academics, four is Charlemagne to God, five is Elliot Wilson. Clap it up for ELHAE Wilson, big Elliot. ELHAE. ELHAE. You did enough fucking crying all year round everywhere that you went. They put you in the fucking top five. But you didn't cry enough. But they didn't put your picture in the shit that go out with the marketing. They put Angie there. See and I watched you and DJ head and the white boy that I like. Now I've seen y'all commentary on it. Next year let's, let's shoot to get that picture in the alleys.

And say to yourself, there are rewards for the work ethic. Absolutely. All of those people at the top of this list work Absolutely through a lot. That's what, that's what we have in common. So that's what's to be saluted. Got a lot of people on the list are hate. I enjoy that too.


Most of 'em, I would say. Yeah. Most of them found a way to manipulate it. There's a value in hate. Yeah. Yeah. There def definitely is.

And shout to Complex. Another great list. Kudos to y'all. Salute, salute, salute. Complex. Well on lists Billboard put out their top 10 Rap Albums of All time. They Did Tom 100.


It was top 100. It was a hundred. Excuse me, I'm just looking at the top 10. Okay. I apologize. You got Lasiks? Yes I do. Okay. That was the end. That was, that was it. They still work. Okay. Yeah. I'm gonna read the top 10. I like the list. Minus one or two places. 10 is slick Rick, great adventures to Slick Rick. Okay, nine is Jay-Z Blueprint. Okay. Eight is Eric B and Rakim paid in full. Seven is Snoop Dogg Doggy style six is Pac All Eyes on Me. Five is Biggie. Life after death. Four is Outkast. Aquemini three is Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Two is the Chronic and one is Illmatic. I'm mad at it. I don't know if Laury Hill qualifies as a Hip hop album.


Yeah, it doesn't. Me in particular. Yeah. I don. I don't, I'm talk, I'm all talk about, I think they coulda took the Lauryn Hill as a Hip hop album out. Yeah, I Think y'all mute up Walk. Fuck Outta here Jersey nigga. We did it. That's it. You Know I feel about they Time Lauren name come up. We gotta do, oh was it RB? No. No. Not Whip Up. I Champion. Whatever that album is. I champion that shit. It's one of the best in wherever you gonna put it. True. So if they choosing to put it in Hip Hop, then you gotta fight with that. You gotta play what's in front of you. It's there. That's true. So Genre, we could argue about the greatness of that album. We Cannot True. I'm probably a fan of the second Chronic more than the first Chronic.


The Impact. Her first one was Impact was different though. Impact was different. I don't have a problem with it. I'm nitpicking. I'm nitpicking. I like that list. I would take Blueprint. I'm not mad at List. Oh no. B Blueprint goes. Yeah. That stay here. Yeah. I see. I was trying to argue for Reasonable Doubt to even be a little higher. It Should be higher. I, I would put Reasonable Doubt there and take Blueprint off for me and I would push it up Was, I'm assuming Reasonable Doubt was on the, on the list. I'm sure It was probably not The list of a hundred maybe possibly. But in the top 10 I'm going Blueprint for Jay-Z's Best and most cohesive project I would have Doggy Style Higher. It's personal, but it's, that album is just, that is the number one.


And I would have good Kid Mad City And it list somewhere. And in the top 10, That's probably 11 In the top 10 for me. It would be top 10. What would you take out? Oh that's easy. Number three is gone for me. Oh, Lauren. Yeah. What other one would you take out? I would put it higher in Great Adventures of Slick Rick and I love that album, but Good kid, mad City. It looks like these albums here are all older albums. For sure. That's my thing about it. It's and and sometimes you get to feel like the older albums can't be moved. I disagree with that. I think there can be an album that's come out in the last, let's say 10, 15 years that can pass some of those older greats that we have.


Yeah, but you just added the word. Great. These albums are not there just 'cause they old. No, I'm saying but the great these, when people do these lists, they usually list the Gimme the other, gimme the other four albums outside of Good Kid Mad City that you think have a argument in this. The current, the current crop In the top 10. Yeah. Don't have to be there just for argument's sake. Show These niggas. That's hard. That's hard. Good Kid. Mad City is one. Maybe. Maybe something within the last 10 years. Telon Don maybe. I would say Get Richard Die trying Get Richard Die Trying Take care. TT 1 0 1, take care. Like we talking Impact with albums and stuff. Carter some of Only Three. Three maybe, but three. I still, I still don't see it.


Dethroning that tent because Just a convo that Yeah, yeah, Yeah. Just convo. The Carter three Get Rich. But what tends to happen, like I said with a lot of these lists is it's almost like a cutoff point. Anything made afterwards, don't even have the possibility. Get Rich is better than great Adventure to look Rick to make Top 10. Not for me, but not for me either. But Rich better. I wouldn't argue it. I wouldn't argue it. I wouldn't argue it at all. Is get rich better than good kid? Mm. They're Is that our good Kid? They're close, they're close to me. They are close for me. Yeah. That's, that's a tough one. It's just close. That's it. We don't have to decide. Yeah. Close. It's just close.


Let's not make ourselves the I enemy. No, no. Not one. Do. Do you guys like the fact that Nas is number one? Yeah. Yes. Yeah. I'm not arguing that at all. I, again, that, that's personal for me. I I have, it was written higher than Illmatic. So. I don't have, I would never have Illmatic as number one Mm. Ever in a, in a, in a NAS disc. Just in a nas discography argument. I forget all time album. But again, with these album, I do respect and understand what Illmatic did. It's, it's also an impact thing. Yeah. So a person's best album don't have to be the great, their classic. That's right. Or their Greatest album. Yeah. NA's Best album is not his greatest album. Right. There's a couple artists like that. I say that about Jeezy all the time.


Jeezy's classic album is TM 1 0 1. But if I was to say what Jeezy's best album, cohesive top to bottom is recession. It's hard to get Illmatic outta here because Impact. One, Two. How many songs? It's nine songs. Nine Real songs. 10 for the Intro. It is nine of those. He didn't have to get into 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. It is nine of a great from every great producer at the time. The Timeless Producers, the ones that pre and fucking Peezy, rock and fucking and Q-Tip And It. It's those. It's those guys like the greatest of the Great. So yeah, I'm not gonna argue this.


I can't, you Can't against, see that's how I feel. That's the Greatest Hip Hop album And that's how I feel about Teflon. Don. Huh? Oh, it's not even, I'm just saying in terms of albums to not even close. That's Not even the same. And I love Teflon Don just Me too. But it ain't even in the conversation for a person where Illmatic album never did it for me. I'm speaking for myself here. There are a lot of albums that I would prefer to listen to over te, I mean over Ima Illmatic. Even in, even in NA's Discography Alone. That album just didn't do it for me. And there's a lot of people that feel that way. I'm not alone in this, but there are goals. Yeah, but classic. And that's just what it's, nah, I'm not letting y'all get that off right now. There's nothing to get off off. There's a lot of people that I'm not letting you get that off right now.


There's nothing to get off. Y you in the nineties, were a fan of Crucial Conflict and Master P and just some other people. So yeah, your opinion is valid to you. But to bring it up right this second and say, yeah, it's a lot of people feel, I mean, yeah, true. But Nas changed the way a lot of people made music for the rest of the nineties. Yo Dog. I remember still lose that. I remember what half time did. Not the people that you listen. I was just gonna say he changed the way a lot of New York made music for the nineties. Not just New York York, but not just New York. Okay. Who else? Tell me outside of New York, give me some people not prior To Matic, people didn't use multiple producers on one album very often, if ever if there was, there might be two producers. That concept in itself is revolutionary. Okay, let me get all the hottest producers right now and put them on an album.


Bro. You talking About Revolutionary, you're talking about the early nineties where New York still producers, right? I'm talking about everybody. I But those are New York producers. Yes they are. Yes. Okay. And At that trend was still the Me, New York Hip hop is the mecca of Hip Hop. And when Nas came out, he was the golden boy. Yep. Of Hip Hop. I, I agree with that. Like for the name IRE or five years, that nigga was on every single Hip hop album that came out. G Rapp Wu-Tang Ghost Ray. Like he was on every album that came out for the next five or six years. He was it. I have no argument to that. Ish none. Yeah. And in terms of longevity, I'm not sure that we can find another Hip Hop album that gets repackaged re fucking Reasonable Doubt in one of the big album. Album Dubs. Yeah, but that's a him I think a Redefined storytelling for the rest of Eternity.


What? What? When? What album? Yes. I know it happened before him. I know it happened before him. It's different. He changed it. Yeah, It's different. And y'all know I'm not the biggest NAS fan. I didn't remotely blink at that shit being number one. Yeah. That shit is, yeah, I guess that's what I'm trying to say. I feel like even the biggest NAS hater can see Illmatic at number one and just go on about his death. Like, Like it was not Oh no, I've, again, I completely understand where, why people feel the way they feel. I'm just saying I disagree with it personally. I'm not mad at it. If I were to, what Would you had number one? Donkey style is number one for me. Style. Got it. Got it. About that. Either And, it was written as number two for me and then probably good kid.


Mad City. Okay. I'm not mad. Thank You. God bless. Age. That's peace. That's peace. That's Peace. My brother. Where would the infamous be? Y'all want, you want me to answer? No? Yes. Alright. Well don't, don't ask Me then. No I do not. Rest Don me Prodigy. Peace, rest. Peace. Don't ask me, That. would The war report be Higher than infamous? You want to ask? I'll answer. I stop it.

How y'all have New York biases bro. That's not true. And It very true. I'm dignifying that shit. I might, I might have an older bias. You Think I didn't know no albums outside of New York that should going The top 20 I didn.


You're putting, y'all putting words in my mouth you think Didn't have any albums outside. I wanted to Hear what albums would make your top 20 that were non-New York. 'cause soon as you said infamous, the first thing you said was, I put it up there with 36 Chambers, which is a New York album. I want to hear where it ranks with non-New York albums. I, that's why I asked you the question. Yeah. You know what's funny? Just For a conversation Bro. you know funny you keep saying that We could do that as adults. When I bought the 36 Chambers album. I didn't have a clue about geography. Me either. Like that shit was just Not a fucking clue. No Shit. It didn't sound like New York shit. I didn't know I was in New York. I didn't know where Staten Island was. I didn't Know shit until to that point. You are one of the guys and I love you to death. You are one of the guys that'll go against the grain on purpose.


So you can't tell me that you went to Elizabeth High School in the nineties and you like fucking No Limit more than you like the infamous. You did that on purpose. How do you do that on purpose if you don't even know what the fuck no Limit is? Because you going against the grain trying to do something different. No it's not. I came up in a different era, Ish. We had music videos in television. I know. So when Make 'em Say is the number one song in the fucking country, who is this? This is dope. I know. And now I follow into, okay, oh Master be okay.

And all that's in the car is that little micro shit. Hey you got you one. The shammy Sham. You joining us, we're talking about the story of a Philadelphia man that was caught in, he wasn't caught in Family Dollar but he was in Family Dollar and he ejaculated on a young woman's leg.


She recorded it, he ran out of the store. Then a few days later, meek Mill put up a post, said and put a bounty on his head. That means something different. I wanna say Bounty on your head means something different. I ain't see Post, I mean means something. He offered money as a reward for this safe capture. Oh true of this person. He said safe capture. Nah, I didn't see that part. The tweets? Yes. Here you go. The people that told to the police gotta read It. I ain't word. Word. What's response to shit is Different. Mel Ice.


Mel ice What Happened. Y'all. I'm wrong verbatim. What'd he say? Nah, I ain't see the tweet. You fucking my Mel. You laughing at somebody's trauma. No, I'm not at a woman trauma. A woman. Let's play, let's play Manhunt with him today in Philly. Some community service. I got two bands for his lo location. I guess you snitching For his lo location I guess she said. But yes that's, That's Location though. But you gotta connect So. I don't see anything about his safe return here. I see the word manhunt. I'm here for it though. Shout out. I'm fucking here For it. He didn't put a bounty on somebody's head. He literally, I got two bands for his location. Location is not a bty.


A bounty is you deliver that nigga Dead. Oh okay. Alright fine. Poa When it come to black men, let us lead the topic. Learn You learn me, you learn the fuck outta Me. Well we talk about how to appropriately address black men. Let us just do it Dick and real quick. So. I. We gotta thank the niggas in in, in Manhattan that whooped the nigga ass. 'cause it's inspiring other people to put the cash out to get niggas fucked up. Yeah. I I think that that's what made the dude turn himself in. That nigga needs some safety. The Wheelchair in what that nigga need Wheelchair. How? Use Some safety then like Yo, lemme just go turn myself in because they, they gonna catch you and I'm not gonna make it. That nigga was sleepy from nothing. Yo Yo. I watching shit again. They Fucked that nigga. I'm letting you get your shit off. And they upgraded his charges that that guy charges two murder.


One the wheelchair dude. Yes. Yes. So So y'all So I. I want to be careful because I still haven't seen them have any evidence that say that that guy did that to that girl. And if I have a brain, this young lady was shot rest in peace. She was shot in the back of her head. This guy is in a wheelchair. Not to say he couldn't have done that, but I need to hear more than he dragged her body to the spot that the cops found. But for them to, for them they did the investigation. Found out who he is. They got him. Well he was on camera. It wasn't hard to find out who it was. I'm just saying. So for them to now upgrade that charge means that they seen they got seen something. Yeah, we would think. We would think. You don't think so?


We would think I just, I'm just saying I need to see what they have I think that they see though Is dragging the body to the location Of the trash. That's after the fact though. That's not enough. That's not enough to, for me That's, that's compelling. That's not as compelling as fuck a greater charge to murder one. Oh well then they found more evidence. That's what I would've said. don don't think it's that compelling if the person we talking about is homeless. I've rummaged through trash. Yeah. I got a heavy bag. I'm taking this somewhere. Oh this ain't me. I'm, I'm leaving this somewhere. Like Yo. I'm just saying I think it's circumstantial Evidence so far. But the mother stated that she, I think they seen some, the mother stated that she had a friend in the wheelchair. That's what the mother told the police. That's what made the police look at him initially. She had a friend or she was around a guy in the wheelchair. Yeah. So they knew each other.


We need more than that. Nah, that ain't enough. I'm just saying I need to see more Rest in peace to that young lady. Rest In peace to, I'm Sorry, stay here. I I was Just saying that The dude in Philly that jerked off on Shorty's leg turned himself in. He did to agree with y'all that maybe the Meek Post had a little bit to do with that. Do with it.

You, you fuck pretty Keisha nigga word. Yeah. It's not about dissing the girl Now the details, if the de the details, if we dis you in the details, then it's dissing you. But it's not really about the woman or the girl.

Or we want to keep the nigga away from the girl. Got It. Oh no I wasn't for that. I'm just saying not me, Just be on some fake, A Lot of my dick When, I was a kid Sometimes whoever you telling to lie to you think that person's never gonna talk to the girl anyway. It ain't gonna happen. And they end up telling I'm lying. Mm. And I might have just went and did something low with the girl, like maybe we went bowling once.


But that's all I need to get my lie off. Okay. And if I got proof of that, somebody like, no you Didn't. If I got proof of that, I hit Yeah.

So you've been because, because the, because the effect is different for us. You've been lied on Multiple times. Oh. Wow, Okay. Most recent times. Yeah, I, I believe so.


Yes. There Was a Recent one I believe I'm starting, I'm hearing. But you know what's funny about that way? So you can't confirm that the dude is doing it 'cause you ain't spoke to him about it. You just have heard And he would probably deny it anyways. So there's no way for for you to confirm. That's true. There's no way for anybody to confirm There. Absolutely. Good job. Right? Yeah. That's facts, right? I mean it always, it's usually hearsay anyways. And, And, but, but people like for the bowling example, like he said, if I got proof of it, so if somebody know we went bowling together, people might just assume. Or if they know so, or they know I'm the type that If I get it, if they know your track record is what it is, then the nigga gonna assume like, oh word. He was with her Hip.


Yeah. He got, he definitely that nigga's in the assassin Hip pop nigga might not Michael nigga be like Michael Ly. Oh yeah, He got, that's my man don't do that. Mike. Who? Ely slept on the couch in his house. I love it. I love this nigga. I made Michael Ely get up and go to the couch in his home, Multiple bedrooms And he gave me the bedroom. I'm not that shit.

I do feel, I do feel powerless. 'cause what are you supposed to do? You supposed to like line up every guy who was ever fucking lied about you and say, did I fuck you? Okay. No. Alright. Get to the back of the line. But Back to Joes point, you don't even know if they lied. Yeah. Some people could just assume that Some people, some people you assume that Yes they did. And whoever considering the source of where you got the information from that will also lead you to believe. Okay. They did. They did tell the tale.


Do you think the truth needs to be defended? Mm Yeah. Sometimes. But when a lie is not challenged. So when a lie is not challenged it becomes The truth. That's not true. Stars said that all the time and I believe it stars wrong when a lie is not challenged it becomes the Truth. For real. That's not true. Unchallenged lie becomes the truth. It's not true. A lot of people feel that way. A lot of people Feel that way. Way. An unchallenged lie becomes perception. No. The niggas that want Don become the truth. The niggas that wanna feel that way feel that way Way. For some people perception Is true. Some niggas wanna feel that way.

Derek White of the Celtics. To which everybody was like, okay, something's fishy here because Jalen Brown is one of the top two players on the Celtics. $300 man finals. MVP and there's three Celtic players on team USA and none of them are Jalen Brown. Why is that? So they started getting into the Nike. Who the other Conspiracy. Oh yeah it is three. Oh Okay. The Nike part of that. So then Jalen Brown tweeted Nike at Nike Yo.

I don't know. Yeah, I think it's a Nike thing. Okay. Fact check it yourself at home. I'm not journalist, I'm top two. Not one, That's all. No, that that was it. I mean I Think it's just big business maybe big business thing. If it is in fact true. Who? Who's JB endorsed by? Yeah, they're Nike. I don't know who Jalen Brown's endorsed by. If anybody. True. If anybody.


But you know Kyrie is no longer Nike. Yeah, listen It is a coverup. I've know it's three. Nah, they don't put three Celtics on the team. That's not Jalen Brown. Like that's, that's what do you want? That makes it obvious. Yeah. What do you want me to say that makes it obvious? Shout to Drew Holiday. Derrick White and fucking Jason Tatum. But come on to get the the jiggers up. You can see what's going on here. Staying on basketball news really quickly. Carmelo's son was interviewing Jason Tatum asked him who would win in a one-on-one with Carmelo versus Jason Tatum if both are in their prime. No, he said what the score would be and to which Jason Tatum said 11 eight. Jason Tatum. Does anybody here think that both in their primes Jason Tatum could be Carmelo Anthony? No one-on-one?

I was in Ohio, so it was, you know, and I, you know, gun war, we doing all this. I got shot and this and that and the third. But one day, one day, don don't know.

No, we're What She forgot. It's okay. She forgot. No, no no's. No, It's you went to a dinner party. You may have made some Go ahead, Yo. So listen, did anybody see Presumed? Innocent? Yes. Yeah. No, you didn't see it? Plug your ears. I Did not see it. No. Y'all got ahead. I'm got it. How many episodes is in this thing? Eight. I looked it up. That was six eight. Yeah. And we're episode six. Yeah. Okay. That's not too bad. Yeah, that's not too bad. We're getting there. It was a great episode. I, I'll try not to spoil it. It was a great You can talk I don. It was. Yeah. don don't care about that. I don't really Care. Y'all don't care. I started watching it so it's so good. It's good. But I, I don't know. It ain't, I don't care. You can spoil it. I, I'm impressed.


Now I'm impressed by how frequently they can change who I think did it. Like every episode it's like, oh man, maybe it wasn't, I've been, oh, maybe it Wasn't. I've been thinking that it was Tommy. It was Tommy the pro Tommy, the prosecutor. Prosecutor. Tommy. Tommy. No, you said that. Yeah. I've been thinking that it was him because when she's talking about, you know, when the, the topic of conversation keeps coming up that she spoke to HR about him, about being uncomfortable with somebody in the office. I knew she wasn't talking about Rusty. She was talking about Tommy. He's, he's go, he's creepy. He's creepy. He gives, he's definitely, he gets super creepy. And then the way he was watching the videos that the son had taken of, you know, her in her nightgown and he a little creepy.


Yeah. I too think that Tommy may have done it. The only thing that throws me off is I don't think Rusty or Tommy is built like that to tie her up like a Turkey with her legs and all that. I think It's gonna end up being the dude that was potentially down with the guy that's in jail. I'm with you, I'm with you. I you There, I think they're just drawing all these different circles to make, to throw you off the path. But it's logical that it's a mimic murder to the other murder. So it would probably have to either be one of the murderers or, Or they haven't shown us who it is, or that They haven't introduced the character or it's gotta be one of the, either the prosecutor or the main dude. I don't, it's rusty don don't think it's Rusty's kid could be rusty.


I'm not all the way off of Rusty, rusty or Tommy, but I don't think it's either the kids don don't think it's her kid that they, that they made. I don't think so made take the stand. And I don't think it's Rusty's kid who was on the bike in the area. don don't. What did you guys think about her coming clean, about kissing the bartender to Rusty and his reaction? I Didn't like how she did it. Mm, okay. Yeah. It's not the time of the place. I agreed with him. I agreed with everything that he said to her, you know, I'm on trial for murder right now and like that's what we on. Like, do you not understand the fucking implications that this has? What this looks like? All of the different opportunities you had to do something different. He read her for filth. Yeah. Right there in that moment. Yeah. And I was screaming at dbe.


Yeah, bitch, why would you tell me that right now? Even if that's true, why would you tell me that right now? And why would you do that after? you know what my problem was when the attorneys are saying to her how she needs to look during the trial and she said, fuck that I'm not. Yeah. I can't do that. I'm not faking. Yeah, like we're angry. I mean, I'm angry he did some shit. If they see it, I'm human. That's what it is. Yeah. It don't look like she doing or saying anything that's gonna help him at all. At All. What? Hell ha no. Fury. They Say I don know, don't you? Yeah, but I don't think Put the fury after. I agree with you. I agree with you, but I'm just saying that I think that's What we're getting. Come on.


Come on ma. Women gotta stop that. They have to stop that at some point. Yes. You were done wrong. Very wrong. Continuously lied to put your family at risk. Yes. All of the things that he did. Don't say put your family at risk. If, if you're gonna, if you're gonna compound putting our family at risk, What's that noise freeze. If you're gonna, if you're gonna put our, if you're gonna, if you're gonna continue to put our family at risk, then don't look at me and say, Hey, you put our family at risk. I wanna rectify that. No, now you're, it's your turn. Now. See I ain't the spiteful chicks that now, Hey, you made me mad. So now it's my turn. Don don't think that she was being spiteful when she was, you know, day drinking with the bartender.


I don't think that that was spite I think that that was just, that was her just flailing. She just lost her job as a result of his actions. you know, the losing, you know, her dying, Carolyn dying, et cetera, et cetera. So it's just like, there is just this Mel. I I don't think that she was not to cut you off. Yeah. I don't think she was being spiteful either. I don't You saw defending Jacob, right? Yeah. The same scene in, in both shows in defending Jacob shorty just, she's been paparazzi following her. Everybody making her life. Hell, she went to the diner and the lady here who turned out to be a reporter, but she didn't know that.


Yes. So she was just looking for somebody to confide in. Yes. And she said, Hey, all of this shit is loading up. My husband, my family at home is going crazy. I can't talk to nobody. And she spoke to her. Yes. And then the lady said, Hey, I'm a reporter. And then that went awry. But I think that was the bartender for Presumed Innocent. Yes, it was. I'm going to the bar. Hey, here's somebody I'm, I'm taking a load off. I'm telling you what's going on. I'm not trying to fuck you A thousand percent. I'm talking about the decision to let her husband know in the middle of a murder trial that I kissed the bartender up the street as if that has importance or should take Priority right now. I totally agree with that. She should never have opened up her fucking mouth. No, she shouldn't have done it.


In the event that somebody is filming and recording you, it's very important the jury is looking at how you handle your husband. Yes. If you're supportive. The lawyers told her all of this shit. Alright, so now you in here, you looking like you're supportive. If somebody pull out a video and you tongue kissing, necking the fucking bartender, it's gonna look away to the jury. That's true. And she didn't go to court for the most important day. Well, one of the days. Yeah. I don't blame her on that. Yes, because you don't wanna relive all the cheating shit. But she didn't go to court. So now that looks away to the jury. I don't agree with her. don don't like her. I don't. You gotta, the way that I looked at that situation is that she is in a fishbowl at this point and she is not used to being here.


Nothing about this situation is normal to her. This excuses are resolved. No, no, no. And this was also thrust upon her. So she's not going to make the most solid decisions a hundred percent of the time. And so when she is in the bar and she's talking to the bartender and she's having a moment where she gets to be seen as somebody other than a, a potential murderer's wife and be desired like she hasn't been by her own husband. She's going to maybe a little selfishly really want this moment just for herself. I don't think that she's thinking about that in the big picture, in that moment of who could be poking in and with a camera, with a tele lens looking at me in this moment.


I don't think that she's thinking I agree with you. I I don't think that she's thinking I, all I'm saying is her bad far head. I'm just saying that's her bad. Yes. I I think it's also her bad. But I also don't lay like the gauntlet blame directly at her feet because of this misstep in, you know, making, in decision making so we can just, because it's, it's so fraught with so much shit. Somebody at some point has to stop compounding mistakes with mistakes. That's what I mean. So yes, we made mistakes. That's how we got here. But now we trying to get out of it. Don't keep doing shit that's gonna fuck my life up and send me somewhere for life. Unless you want that to happen. Do you think that it's, her support of him is going to win the jury over Don?


Don't think that she's shown the most support thus far. I don't think any of her behavior is. She's a wife who's sitting right behind her husband ex excluding that day. And she spoke about why she did not go in that day because she just did not want to relive hearing what is on her computer and what is his on computer before that. But before that spoke to her before, but before that she's sitting behind him. She's sitting behind the man that is her husband, the father of her children who fell in love with a, another woman, initiated a an affair, told his wife after he got caught that it was over, he restarted that affair, impregnated that woman. And now she's murdered. This Is, and he's looked at as the Suspect and he's murdered and he's looked at as the prime suspect and it's really, really looking like he actually fucking did it.


Hold Me down. So, Wow. Hold me down. That is exhausting. Yes. Hell, that's Exhausting. Everything you just said is right. That Is exhausting. I fell in love with my coworker. We was fucking, I did want to be with her. I was treating you shady. And now she's murdered and I'm on trial for her murder and She was hold me down pregnant, Be a strong black woman. Stop it. She crazy. Stop. This nigga is crazy. Everybody abandoned chip right now. I So you wouldn't hold her down. I I ain't never watched the story. I ain't know it was that deep. But I know people that wouldn't be in court with that nigga. Yeah. you know how many people wouldn't be caught with that nigga?


I would be So. I would be so furious. He's rich. Yeah. He's a lawyer. He was like the deputy. He's he's prosecutor the bills. He's paying the bills and she went and tongue kissed the broke artist nigga who Issa Rae wouldn't fuck on. Insecure Yo. Can you hear this nigga? He's paying the bills. The bills Nice house you a psycho Yo. That's all right. So that you psycho, That negates all of his wrong Going. I'm psycho because I said that he was paying the bills As if it is a equivalency for all or For all bad behavior. A justification for all the shit that she just Named. I never said that. I never said that. Yes, You You didn't have to. You weren were saying that like holding, You're alluding it to, I'm not alluding to anything.


Don't put words in my mouth. I'm not all don't to that. That's just an extra fact. It is a fact. Well if I'm right about it, that he was paying the bills. Yeah. Okay. So and She was a stay at, stay-at-home Mom. Okay. No, She had a job. Was she she got fired. She was in the gallery. She yeah, she worked to the gallery. Our gallery, yeah. Oh. But she wasn't a boss up there. You see how they spoke to her when she tried to come Back to work? Hey, kind. I just want to come Back to work and get my head. It's like, no, no, it's go home. What? It's, I spoke to the board. What we don't want you Here what it's looking like beginning, like at the beginning of their careers, she made the choice to put her career on hold in order to be Where Did you get that? It's really indicated in the story. And You know it I don, you know it, you Got it. I agree. Mel. No, that's true. That's true.


you Know what? It's, it's very much like dark matter because they're both art. The wives are both artists and they both put it on pause. No, I think you're just filling the gap, but it's fine. No, I agree. No, because When you, when he, when she goes outta the house, she goes to the back to the shed and you realize this is her art gallery, like her own Paintings and stuff. No, he was the fucking head honcho at that law firm. Everybody who get up there say It. It wasn't a law firm. He was the, he it it's the prosecutor's office. So he works for the state. He is the head honcho and the, he didn't Start off the vice's head honcho. But he didn't, he didn't start off that way. His man Was, his lawyer is the, was head honcho. But Morgan. Yeah. Yeah. He is the best up there. Yeah. All of them have said it. They heart. But he didn't start off that way. She Got kicked out of the art building.


Oh. Sake. So now you telling me what she Gets, she gets kicked out because that, because of him, because of him More. Now Joe, closer aside, I actually more, more facts do agree that she should hold him down because for the sake of the kids. So then you, so she should hold them down for the sake of kids. But she can't go get no dick. She can Go get Dick. She can go get dick. Oh, okay. Not how she did it. Yeah, but hold 'em down. Not how she did it. That's not holding 'em down.

I didn't see anything So. I I don don't know if It is true and it's authenticated then it's corny That what If OVO is selling wife beaters and hired a model that looks exactly like Kendrick's wife is corny.


And. it just leans into, again, not being able to lose gracefully. Get away from that. Get into your hit bag. Go get in your bag. Go get in your bag. Enough of this, this battle is over this, this one's over. We don't care. We don't care anymore. Agreed. I, That's my take on it.

Number One Act said that's not true. Again, I want to shout out act for being number one Charlemagne for being number four by Charlemagne's book. Fucking get Honest or Die Lion. I wanna shout out Elliot for being number five. All of my peers and contemporaries that are on this list deserve that.


I know we say that these lists don't matter and maybe they don't, but sometimes they do speak to people's work ethic and the fucking will that people have to stay in this stay in this cockamamie game. That's what I'll say. Congratulations to all parties that made it act. It's man room in the year too. Nigga. I'm, I'm still coming for one. We only have You my man.

Big gap from one, two and y'all. Monumental space now Three. Three. I Was gonna say three. Three. Oh no, three could have been two's in that conversation. Three could have been two. But when we start talking about three, I'll start talking about Hip Hop personality part. He's just big. Yes. He's probably bigger than everybody on the list at this point. Might be. Yeah. But when he was bigger When, you talking about he was bigger when he said Yo, I'm appearing over there. I think it was Union Square to give away some PlayStations and that shit turned into what it did. No, he wasn't bigger then. Shit. I know, I get it. Yeah. His big kept going. Pause.

No, I got you. If I was three, four, it's disrespectful though. If Complex puts Joe, Joseph, Anthony button number four, I gotta go up there. You don't even get a podium at four. you know what I mean?
