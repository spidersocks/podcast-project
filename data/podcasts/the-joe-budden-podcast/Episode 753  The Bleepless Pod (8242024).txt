I try to speak of and about people with a certain amount of respect at all times. I try not to say things on this microphone that I would not say in front of people or to people's faces. And I try to speak in a way that I would like others to speak about me up here. Do you feel like because People, that's that's that's, that's what I call it. Do you feel like, 'cause people speak So, and this ain't a Joe button interview neither nigga. This ain't hey yo Joe time. But the shit off go saying, Do you feel like, 'cause people speak so freely about you and you just take it that you feel like You can do the same?


No, I don't do that until, until someone puts more chips to the middle of the poker table. If you put more chips to the middle of the poker table, I'm like Oh, okay. Oh, oh. So you're surprised when people react. Oh so let's gamble. No, but I'd like to see the way that people react. They react Got it. Yes, because I like that. That's cool. 'cause one thing about me that's, you know, is that, or maybe people don't, I don't really give a fuck about none of This shit out here. It's all like kind of inconsequential. It all is. I clock in and clock out or work don don't take work home with me.


I'm not looking to be liked by the field. I'm not looking to do business with the field. I'm not looking to have con whole conversations with the field. There's whole sectors of this music industry that know to clear out and move around when I'm around. Do You just, do you just look This shit? I'm not gonna be buddy buddy. Huh? Do we just wanna get to the shit? Because it seem like we, we speaking directly Start with the docket. I mean it sounds like that's what's happening right now. Oh, I was just speaking blanket to in general To the field docket Got it. Oh, he got a Docket. You got a docket. I don't know if you wanna get to the docket now we can wait. Let's start with Yachty. Man. That's a It is right. He's right there. He's right there. It is still kind of, It is still, It's still your fault kind of.


Y'all, y'all first of all, don't force a docket on me neither. I'm in a great mood. But You gave us this whole soliloquy, Which is, which applies to the field. But I'm in a great mood. Don't force a docket nigga. You too clever for that. People know. Clever. I also am at the ages Virgo season, my birthday around the corner. All right. I don't really, I don't like seeing men get in the back and forths with women. I agree. I don't, don don't. I don't. don don't. Yes, I know. I have gotten into back and forth with women maybe three times over 10 years. I think I lead by example for the most part. Even when they kick my back in Three.


Yeah. I mean by my count. But we can start with y'all. come on. Let's start with does anybody else have a docket? No, because y'all ain't gonna jump me on bleep on bleep list day. I gotta I gotta be cool. No, I don't have a docket. I was expecting to walk into a Altima but outside of that, no. don don't have a docket. But we can continue Now. I'm putting eyelashes on it. That little stupid shit in the front. You gotta beat Dazzle the steering wheel too. Yeah, give it up. Up Bra on the front. Yo remember leather bra in the front of This? shit, he's nasty man. All yacht.


Where do we start with Little Yachty? He had, he Had a bunch of shit. He had a bunch of shit. Yes he did. Where do we start with Little Yachty? I, I blame Joe for this. Do we start with the key Key Glock interview? We have to, yes. Yeah, we have to start there. And I'm gonna let it rip. Shout out to little Yachty. Shout out to Mitch. Yeah, I like the podcast. I am gonna let it rip. Fuck. I hope it's Nots in jeopardy. Alright, so When I know I'm right, so I'm, what's up? So Let's go back to Eric and I'll send this to you. 15. We was at my momma's house, right? I'm at my momma's house now. Mitch is like two, three years older than me. All right? Now Mitch came to me and for maybe years you didn't just start making beats by the way, you've been making beats since.


Who knows how long you've been No Joe Biden. And up until how long we been doing this? Exactly. Yeah. I'm not. Okay. So Up until about maybe a year and a half ago, two years ago, what? You spent a lot of time trying to find your steps, right? Right. But so that's gonna sense my point. No, no, no, no, no, no. Imagine if you didn't have a friend who's already extremely successful to help you get on your feet. Why? People don't have that. So what I'm saying is how, what do you say? 'cause you didn't wanna get a job.


I never even suggested you get a job. 'cause I knew you wouldn't get a job. Like what do you say to a who's like, Hey, I see Gun chill with a gunshot. A dog at the point, A shiny watch, I gotta a gun, a dusty gun. It's gonna take a shiny watch. you know what I'm saying? What do you tell it? Too many clip. I'm letting it go. It's important. I'm Not gonna encourage it, but you gotta think about people Got it. What I'm tell you is This shit. You can tell bro. What Even if, even if I'm telling you, think about yourself, but Listen, but no, no listen though. Even if then say that's why I, that's the point I'm trying to make to you, bro. What point, even if then if I wasn't doing shit righteous, then older now So, I would not tell it to do anything like I was doing back then, bro. Bro. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You's what I'm trying to tell you. That's fine. But you, that's 'cause you've been through, you've been through years of, of, of development, bro.


That's the point of it. So, I can win. That's the point. But think about remove me from this situation. Remove me. I was never in your life knew Joe Biden. Would you have been doing who? I feel like you might have been doing that shit. Who knows what you've been doing. If you ain't, if if you ain't having to show, you know, What are you saying Bro? I'm saying that what you're saying is not, it's not, you're not, you're not like, it's not true. You wouldn't tell him, Hey man, just go get a job, man. No, I ain't Saying, I ain't saying no. That's not what I said. I ain't saying, I was telling nigga, go get a job. Distinguished cast. Oh, I can keep going, but I mean, I, I agree. There's a lot going on.


You got the point. Yeah. There's a lot going on. So, I, I agree with both folks. This, this is the start of this. I agree with both. Okay. What triggered it? He was, Mitch Was telling Kegel lock or What, what triggered they were having a conversation about, you know, how people used to move. I, I guess as far as just sticking people up, doing certain things. Okay. Got it, Mitch's message was, yo, I've been in that space before. Now I wanna tell people how to do something differently. Got it yachty's point is, well that's easy for you to say because you was able to transition from that through me. I'm the person that was able to supply you with the opportunity. Some of those people don't have that, so it's easy to say that. But think of those people who just trying to get it so they got a little rusty gun and they, they see somebody with a little watch a little car and they first thought is, I need that right now in the moment, no matter what the fuck you might be thinking, I need it.


And I, I I think both messages make sense. I just don't like the delivery of how Yachty gave It. I think both of 'em make a total sense. We've had similar conversations up here where I'll be like, yo, you, you talking from a position of privilege? you know what I'm saying? I think that once you do, I I'm use you, Joe started his podcast from the ground. So now that he's up, if he went back and told to my yo do X, Y, and Z, that's based on his experiences and things that he's learned on that climb and that ascension yachty's, Conde saying, yo dog, you can't tell 'em nothing because you would've been them.


That's why I can speak to them because I would've been them. And now I've seen another way and I can now go back and say, Hey, that way even When, I was on that path. It was some bullshit. Somebody showed me a light and now I got more information and now I could speak to that same thing. That's what I got from the dude, Mitch. you know what I'm saying? And I think he wasn't necessarily able to convey it. Ish, if I spoke to you like this, you would punch me in my face. Yes. That's not true. You would punch me in my face Directly on this. I disagree. I don't think that's true. I disagree. don don't think nigga, he was spoken to me worse than that. Yeah. No, he didn't. What? Not over here. You see, I didn't think that was particularly Disrespectful the way me and Joel had worse conversations than that. He told his man, he told you guys were throwing headphones at each other and turning.


I was talking about Not that conversation. He, he, he that's he It is to me it seemed like he belittled his man a little bit. Yes. To me. Like, yo, listen, I don't, I don't see it that way. I don don't look at it like that. Like I think his man wasn't a I'm sorry, go ahead. I'm sorry. Without me you wouldn't be in the position you are in now. That's true. Yeah. But you don't say it like that. Why? If it's true then why you saying that? What's understood never needs to be said. I understand that. I Got a list of people I feel like saying that too. I'm saying I don. I don't Say it. I'm saying that in that particular context and in that particular conversation. Oh, and let's say I'm, he was trying to make his, They both say that that's how they, I don't Yeah, they both say that that's how they get down. I want to start. Okay. They both say that we speak like this.


We joke around like this. We are blunt like this. We're on that pod. we know what time It is on that pod, but he know what It is in real life. They both have said that, which leads to, well, I'll let you finish first. No, I'm just saying that I think that homeboy wasn't able to, Mitch wasn't able to really articulate, get his point across. You get what I'm saying? I think that if he would've been able to get his point across saying Yai Yeah, you right, you've shown me the light and now I want to go back and show somebody else the light. Okay. I'm not, I'm not sure you want to, but to me When, I'm listening to Yai. That sounds like someone that's really just frustrated and mad about a whole bunch of other things that's going on around him. Huh? And, and I'm, I'm saying that to say in this clip.


Yeah. The later clips I'm what you No, no, no. I think, I think some of That is leading to why we even got that later clip. You think of people being unappreciative. I think I I think he's probably one of those people who, who's now entering the phase of I'm no longer just doing for self. I'm trying to actually put people on, I'm trying to help people. And When, you get into that space and you're not hearing enough thank yous or you're not hearing enough people really appreciate that you start to become like a little, a little angry. Especially When, you're now meeting these people that you're trying to help who are actually not appreciating what you're doing for them. I don't think hearing it, I think seeing the appreciation is, is, is important. Not sometimes, sometimes, sometimes. Sometimes. No. And I'm gonna say this, I, I credit, I credit Joe and, and kiss with giving me my actual start in the industry as far as just nationally, like getting a real notice.


And I think I've shown the appreciation, but I've also said it like, yo, thank you. Like that to me goes a, a long way because they don't have to do that. And those are risks that they take as well as trying to put people on. Because who's to say, I'm gonna go ahead and do everything the right way. So, I think Yai is probably looking at he Did the Yeah. Like I ain't know you was gonna heat up like This Shit, what do you thought I was going do? come on, stop. It's not about Me. No, you, you out, you nigga. Anyway, I'm sorry. Now you outta Here. But if, if you helping, if you helping people, if you helping people, then you finding yourself falling out with them and you find yourself in the hole or you find like yourself where you feel like, yo, I didn't get anything outta this outside of people just shitting on me.


You might start to build up a certain resentment. So, I. Think when I'm hearing him say that, I think I'm hearing some, some of that brew over and spill to just the situation. I think If I was as up as him at 27, maybe I, maybe I expressed myself that way too. I don't know. I don't think that, to me this is as, as podcasters, we know how We talk to each other up here versus how We talk when the mics are When you, to me that conversation isn't particularly disrespectful. It sounds like pod conversation to me. Really? Yes. Yeah. Yo, not When I don don't think, I don't think that. I don't think that. No, no. I think I, I think having Heard the later clips, how can you feel like that? Because I still feel like they have that relationship. I feel like sitting around saying, oh, he's sunning him. His I, we sound like all the forums and communities that discuss us like, oh, Joe hates Ish.


Ish hates flip. It's like that's not reality. Don't we don't know Hate that. But he doesn't talk to us like that. We don't know that they patch it up neither. That's true. Maybe not. we know That. No, he did. They didn't. Well Mitch later went on his Twitter rant and well from this clip Yai expressed that he was angry that Mitch didn't clear up anything that was going on. Yes. On Twitter. Yes. While he was asleep. Totally upset. So he just woke up to a barrage of attacks. Bullshit attacks and how he said the talk went, which we'll hear in a second, is Mitch was like, come on man. That's just Twitter. Yeah. And that's not an acceptable answer. It's dismiss as a friend. It's dismiss in That moment. That means Mitch felt the way as well.


That's it. Mitch felt the way and he wanted other people to feel Away with it. Nah, that ain't true nigga. Really view It is, It is just Twitter. don don't matter. don don mind, you know how it rock. Nah, it's once, once something is out, it's out. It's nothing You can do. People gonna talk, everybody don't respond to the talk the same way. There's a big, really, there's, There's a big part of this that people are missing. There's certain things that were said about Yachty from other people that I think Yachty is looking at his man a little funny now, which is why we even get to him saying things like, yo, fuck you, I'm off this podcast shit. Like, don don't, the the, the tweets to me that the dude Mitch put out, I think was the cleanup from him really making the mistake of Yachty having to deal with not just that criticism, but some other things that he was cri criticized about. Alright, so let me speed you up and get to some of the other parts of the story.


I don't agree with that. Then some, some waitress at a restaurant got to, got to leaving comments and said, and she was talking about the young lady that his artist yachty's. Artist That. is That Caribou? Carou? I'm not very familiar with her Car. Her name is Caribou. Yeah, Caribou. Yeah. Okay, so that's who she's talking about here, bro. She walked in my job, red Lobster, to order some biscuits and I asked her why she left, she immediate, why she left. She immediately corrected me and said I didn't leave. They kicked me out saying they were really mean to her and bullying her a lot. She doesn't talk about it because it won't, it cut off. She seemed really hurt behind this, to be honest.


Like they really did her dirty. And I believe it's just because her name was the biggest behind Yachty. If we're being real. I only started listening to him again because of her, they're haters. And I told her she'll do just fine without him. Fuck 'em. I would've just took that as an internet comment. But it seems that that sent Yachty in a different direction. So he tweeted, I don't normally do this, but, and then the night turned up, He got that live and started Letting go and once nigga getting Thatta live and start getting his shaken boy. And in New York Streets too. Yeah, he boyed he shake the table. So let me try to find where to even start with that Because it was quite a bit, he he was ranting quite a bit.


It sounds like he had a lot of animosity with Caribou. Yeah. Yeah. He apparently wrote himself. She said she Was disrespectful. She was, she she talked down on people she disrespected. It is a car. He wrote a bunch of songs for her and styled her. Yeah. If it wasn't for he said he styled all of them. He said, I, he said you guys did not leave the house without me putting an outfit on you guys. He said he's 900 K in a hole. Yeah, I put eight carrots in your ears. What? He said, Go ahead. I'm still looking. Oh no, this, I think I think that homeboy's Gonna show people like how cool you are and it's going to give you a platform. you know what I'm saying? I ain't wanna do no motherfucking podcast, nigga. I'm a motherfucking rapper, nigga got millions of dollars.


I don't need to talk to other rappers. What the fuck are we talking about? I did the podcast for Mitch then put goddamn 3, 3, 3, $400,000 in Mitch's pocket. And y'all sitting here talking about something he disrespecting his friend and I got, I'm I, fuck, fuck. I ain't fucking with Mitch, bro. I talk, I I been sleep all day. I wake up to this crazy shit, Mitch. How I say, Mitch, how the fuck you didn't go on the internet and tell these folks that we playing, bro, that tweet got goddamn damn 6 million views on it. How the fuck you aint gonna tell them folks we playing? Man, It is Twitter, bro. you know how That is, bro. you know how Twitter is bro.


It's not a good answer. you Know how Twitter is bro? All fuck that damn nigga. Fuck the podcast nigga. Fuck you. Fuck you Easy yo. But it's all so When I know I'm right. So That's the whole clip. What do y'all think of that? I I I agree with with him. Yeah, I agree with him. It's not just Twitter. It's not just Twitter. Everybody is on YY side. I I wasn't on his side with the first clip. I'm saying right there, It is like, yo fam, if you see This shit is spiraling out control Cut him. My defense, you, You could do damage control a lot of times you might be happy that This shit is going like that because now you getting your name some more shit. Exactly. And you getting more and more and more press. you know what I'm saying? Knowing that that's your man, we gonna go fix it.


No, your job as my man is to clean that shit up and say, nah, that's my man. We talk to each other like that. We was just fucking around Question and maybe this is specifically for Joe and Flip even more so you don't think all This shit could be good for their podcast? Yeah. You think Mitch not clearing that up immediately isn't kind of good for their podcast? Like let's, Let's Yeah, but not if You, if you are Yachty, Yachty said like he said, I don't need a podcast and I'll put you on and for you to let me get dragged through the mud like that and not clear it up. That shit stings different When. you put somebody on and they allow people to come up with a perception and not even jump out the window and say, yo, no, this is not true. Or defend you. That just stings different. Everything's our always business because you make, you make, you make a lot of sacrifices here.


People don't understand that when you're dealing with people that's not known and you're known, you make a lot of sacrifices for them to get to a level where they could sustain. I get that. you know what I'm saying? Or get some money in their pocket. So those sacrifices you make, even if it leaves you like don don't know the word I'm, I'm, the sacrifices you make may be worse if you understand what I'm saying. I do. Yeah. I think that's one of, I think that's another one of the biggest myths in podcasting, right? Like shit is on air, We on air, We on air, We on air. You are only on air if you are on air. If the shit on air starts affecting off air, then you're not just on air anymore.


Right. And what it seems like listening to these clips is that some shit is affected. It's a lot of It is a lot affected. That's not on air. It is not. I'm gonna play these other clips. But now you so hold on. Where, where do You stand in that? Where in which part? Because it's It is nuance. Which part? The When. you start talking about how certain things, 'cause I said I agree with Yadi. Right? And you're Saying you don't, I don't agree. I I don't agree. Let me be ignorant for a minute. I love a good birthday crash out. Let me be ignorant for two seconds. Who's birthday is it? Yachty. Oh, for Yachty. His, it was a few hours away from his birthday. He got shit shaken.


If you going to crash out, I'm not totally mad at it being on your birthday. I'm not. And then go to bed. That's fly. Now ignorance to the side. I I, I'm not saying I disagree with the things that he's thinking because he's feeling a way. I disagree with every way he went about handling it. But again, I'm giving him Gracie's turning 27 years old. But I disagree with his handling of Mitch in, in the first clip. I disagree with how he continued to speak about Mitch publicly.


I disagree with, and this is again from the outside outsider's perspective. I disagree with fucking now Yachty slamming the girl who is Mitch's ex. I disagree with that. Even I didn't know it was Mitch's ex. Yeah, yeah. This is Mitch's ex. Yo, hold Up the, the person in question. You let wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Real quick Joe. What you saying? The rapper? The the Caribou girl? No, the other girl. No other girl. It is, It is another Girl. Okay. But, but here's what When, you do a lot for your niggas and they come off ungrateful and not appreciative. A lot of times you let a lot of shit slide.


You let a lot of shit slide. Personally. Yai probably let a lot of shit slide. And then now It is a point where the fucking water balls over and that's it. So that's the point that he's at. Like, yo nigga, I let a lot of shit slide that you niggas do or that you've done. Not saying that I know I I'm just by hearing him, that's assumption. you know what I mean by hearing him. Yes. I'm saying that at 27. I too may not have handled this the best, but When, you, When you do a lot. You should just do a Lot. Don't have any expectations. You saying It should. It shouldn't be to get something in return. Throw, Throw shit back in people's faces where Yeah, I agree with that because He said I put $400,000 in your pocket. I'm pretty sure that means that he made at least double that Whatever it means.


You know what I'm saying? Don't why are you putting what you, what what you made me into the public. Don't make it sound like I'm a charity case. But that's why I said it sounds like this is some trickle over of some other things that's about It is experiencing and becoming this person who's now leading some things. He has a group, he has a label. So it sounds like this is a trickle down effect. I I honestly feel like Mitch just got the shitty end of a stick that was already there. I disagree with with Yadi saying I'm a, I'm a rapper, so why the fuck would I be starting a podcast? It's because It's beneficial. Yeah. It Is been, It is been one beneficial To him. We're not, we're not stupid. Like Yeah, like I did like come on, come On. It was beneficial to you two. Yeah. Like It was more beneficial to him than, than than Mitch.


Yeah. People probably still ain't really like to me, So I'm not dismissing the feeling. I'm dismissing the the the how he went about it, I guess. Look, he he went off Bro. Go ahead tell people how you talk to people. How you tell my Got this is talking to Me. Oh, we, we you ain't got no, you're poor and we above you and how you, you talk to people like they nothing. You talk to people like, they like, they small like they like they beneath you bro. Bro, hold on.

How you, how you go around treating people in your everyday life. I've been letting you do this whole thing where you act like you like a princess and you sweet and you know, like he Going up. Oh you just such a good girl bro. Stop the front bro. We didn't internally, we have withheld your actions since the beginning of me giving you this career. What are we talking about bro? Oh The fuck can we, what y he, what fuck are we even talking about bro?


He not, You don't even do nothing. You what the fuck? Oh yo Bro, He ready don't you? It's So crazy to me, bro. 'cause I fucking, I I I've given you a career and time to time you just disrespect me. I wrote every fucking verse you've done. I I dressed you, I dressed all five of y'all niggas bro. I dressed five niggas every time we stepped out the house, I put an outfit on everybody. I put eight kara of earrings and everybody ear. I put three chains on all y'all neck. We bought a cardio watch. I gave you that Chrome Rolex. Bro. You the most, you you was watching nice guy tables. You was, you was, you was, you was waiting.


What are we talking about? Nigga? I changed your motherfucking life and you weren here lying, talking about some we bully you. That shit got me fucked up. Right. You got me fucked up, bro. You disrespectful bro. You talk to people crazy. You kept, He was crashing Out. You get the point. I feel like this too is Like, I feel like this about niggas and I never say it. I I just would never say that. I feel like you gain nothing by saying it. I'm sorry, Parks. Yeah, go ahead. You gain, you gain nothing by saying it. You, You don't but you do. Tell me A relief. No, no, no. Like Nigga relief in the bathroom. No, no, no. When I first came on the pod. Right? When, I first came on the pod.


Niggas was coming up to me like, yo dog, why you fucking with that nigga? Right? So I ain't know what was going on Behind me. What nigga? Who? Everybody who's that nigga talking to The media? Oh, I'm about to say, I mean no not the media, I mean just people outside. Right. Said why they fuck with You because they heard What you're Saying. How they broke up from, you know what I'm saying? A certain standpoint. Right. So you really never got an opportunity in which to clear the air. Not that you care to, to some people that's you. Some people care to, especially after a period of time and you just keep hearing certain things, hearing certain things, hearing certain things. Sometimes the shit will come to a boil. We be like, yo dog, I'm tired of This shit. I did X, Y, Z, A, B, C do.


It is like a woman or a man that go through a breakup. Right. And, and the man might be telling his homeboys, yo, yo, she did this and she did that and she did this and she did that and yo she a piece of shit and your man's like, damn, that's fucked up. And then shorty comes through and be like, I did what I did. Boom, boom, boom, Boom. And if either one of those people started telling their stories publicly, I would be saying the same exact thing. I know. No what you mean? If e if anybody took whatever story they wanted to tell and then had enough, enough is enough and then took it to the internet to try to convince people or just You only suck. Give people Yeah. you know not, but I'm not with all of the, the, the public shit. I'm, I'm saying That's you, you got people deal with it differently.


You're More mature and you only end up doing that. Oh yeah. No, 27 I maybe do. Hold on. You only end up doing that when people are critical of what's currently going on and they don't know the inside. Yeah. Nigga is attacking you based off if niggas is attacking you based on false information that tight you tight. Exactly. How much can you take? Y you took a lot of attacks based off of false information and it took you coming around other people. I don't, I don't like yacht. I don't like Yachty responding like that off of hearsay from somebody posting something on Lie like the girl girl, she probably said that. Well cool. But the girl didn't go online. She ain't do no interviews. She ain't speak nothing about him at this point. She's just been kind of silent and doing whatever she's been doing.


So I thought the girl started talking about how she was getting abused and da da da da. No she told Ahan home girl saying she apparently she told the fan. We don't even know if that's true. We don't know. It is just hearsay from another person. So if you reacting off of that, that's true. It's like no you, you kind of, And then shorty op did respond. I don't have that response because like I told y'all, I was unfamiliar with this young lady until last night and then Yai responded again. Now this is to Camille? Yes. I think this is Mitch's ex. This is Mitch's. Mitch X said that she had some dirt on Yai. Yeah You wasn't, you're not even a Factor. Oh Shit, I'm not even playing.


I'm Not, see they not supposed to get to this point. Yeah. you Know what's your man, I'm saying ex girlfriend, Your man's ex is never supposed to go public and say a thing Dude. Dumb ass broad. Hold on bitch. Bitch you dumb Broad. This nigga was telling you lies just to get away from you. Ho what is you talking about? Hoe nigga talking about all the time you called me snitch meetings me ain't never did no damn meetings for me nigga. Fuck is you talk about nigga. Nigga what me bro. Me bro. Stop, stop playing with me. Ho you wasn't, you not even a factor in this bro. You was really a bitch that he just used to use to sleep at your motherfucking house. Hoe. I ain't never stole a dollar from me nigga. Mitch been living with me since the motherfucker Joe When, I lived in my mama house.


He lived with me nigga. Hell you talking about hoe This is a birthday crash out about what You talking about? You not even a, you don't know nothing. You talking about how is you, what are you saying bro? I ain't never stole a dollar from that nigga. If anything I helped him nigga out. I, I dare you miss. You better get this hoe bro. You better get you at get this whole bro. No, I'm not speaking publicly about How It is Bro. I don, I don't care what y'all Me fucker you talking about. Hoe nigga put This shit to the side for me. Ho what is you talking about? You got some, Nor am I speaking to my man. If you got some dirt, bring it to the motherfucking light. So we really tell everything how It is. We tell everything how It is because I know about you. You, you was a bitch that just you, you gave a nigga a place to sleep.


You Jump Out, he's leaving your place. Stop playing with me. Ho you was nothing in This shit bro. You, you, you, you by the way y'all this the cousin we be talking about this the cousin. Oh, Then he dropped that too From the podcast talking about the cousin like, like the cousin. Like like oh you dumb you we Apparently they're cousins by marriage. Yeah, Mitch and a young lady. Lemme say I really like Mitch. I like both of 'em man. I don like their show. Yeah, but I'm just saying I just met Mitch recently. Okay, gotcha. So like Yachty I've met for a few years now. But. yeah, Mitch seemed like all right guy to me, I ain't Gonna lie. I feel like Yachty just had his first like real bad week in podcasting in terms of the impacts that podcasting can have on his life in terms of the rumors of Drake unfollowing him and then this clip, oh that part going wrong.


I think he's having his first bad podcast a week Past podcast and I think he's just having this real first bad experience of being a, a leader or trying to be a leader or Something. Yeah, that part too. Yeah. Literally. I think that's, he's really starting to see what it feels like to try to be at the forefront of not just your own career but other people's careers. I I think the public exposing of the T is disgusting. I don. Yeah. come on man. don don't like that nigga. Come on nigga. We bigger than that. Like I don't like it but I understand it. Not me don don't because I think that, that that's your moral. Somebody speaking about me like that publicly. We, we will never speak. Yeah. Like that's hard to it's hard to come back from that. That's me. I'm not trying to talk to, to their relationship.


Yeah, clearly they have a different relationship so they are right. 'cause Mitch did, he went to Twitter and he said please don't let that clip misguide you. It doesn't represent me and yachty's friendship at all. We joke around pretty harsh sometimes too much. For real sometimes, but in real life it's nothing. It's nothing but respect and love. I can't get on here and act like It is not everybody that know me knows I put in work. Nobody can take that from me. And he wasn't trying to take that from me. We were just debating on Cameron. It got taken outta context. If you don't hear it from me, if you don't hear it from me, It is not true. Actually I read this backwards. Oh fuck it. I'm gonna keep reading backwards. That's okay. If you don't hear it from me, it's not true bro.


Bro never stole from me and we don't have no shady history or anything along that nature. So that's ka I ain't nobody's little bro never been. Check my history. I had stats before I met bro and got even more now. All I ever wanted to do was just focus on the music and being involved in the cul in the culture in a positive way. I hope none of this hinders that. Well, well said Mitch. So if, if Mitch don't have an issue with nothing, I certainly don't have an issue with nothing. Sure dude. Right. Again, I don't think that clip was really that bad. The initial clip that set this whole shit up. Yeah man don don't think it was really something to make, make this big Of a deal Outta and per Yachty. They was friends when they was broke. Right. Said yo, you live with me 10 years.


When I was in my mama house before I ever made a dollar. You live with me. So I think hopefully their friendship is one of them. Like from the mud rags, the richest type shit. They should be strong. That should affect, that should affect the Yachty. It did. He go he he he's looking at everything and everybody different. You could, no matter how long y'all been cool, he's he's going through, he's going through something different. Like that frustration that crash out isn't just simply because I'm disappointed in this moment. It's bunch of shit. It's a bunch of Shit. Sounds like it's a bunch of other shit. It's a bunch of Other shit piling on. And I do, I I understand everything he's saying in that clip about homegirl, just whatever. But you don't say that out in the public. That's you. right. You call your man yo. Listen, get Get shorty yo. Yeah. That, that's my thing. That's what, that's, that's Mitch's job.


Yo. Tell her to shut the fuck up before I go. Yeah you need, you need to tell her to take down whatever she took yo. Because some of the shit she's saying Yachty could now start looking at him funny. Like where does she even get that from? Nah, Yachty understands what she Got it from. It's like when your man use you as a ally, yo yo I was, you know what I'm saying? The niggas know. No, no. But see that's the difference though. Some niggas know that. My man just used me as that. But some niggas really think that. Oh wait, you really was Charlie Said it. He's like Yo dog, he telling you that to get away from your dumb ass. Oh yeah I gotta go over here and run, take this meeting for Yi 'cause blah blah blah blah blah. Yeah that's 'cause Sharon over there Not be all success. All we had to go out town 'cause y'all doing all this dissection shit.


Man I all that shit is crazy. Oh It is all that shit is crazy. No I'm not disagreeing. That shit is crazy. I ain't gonna know what we dissecting. That shit is nuts. That shit is nuts. Yeah. This Is a lot for a little fucking pod argument. That's all I'm saying. Yeah, It's triggering a lot of more. But Again, I think it could be good for the podcast business if they continue to do the podcast. Sure. Which I think they are. People Will tune in more. Yeah. I Don It Is gonna bring say here, I'm not, this feels roll out even I'm not playing another one Bites to Dust because don don't believe that it's over for this podcast. Nah, They seem to be genuinely fucking from the ground up. Friends like come On. Yeah, they love each other. Mitch went to the internet, he cleaned it up. Hopefully Yachty, when his birthday passes he'll be in a better mood and that's that.


But he went off a little bit. Yeah he Did. I'm not mad though. His nasty. But I'm not mad. Sometimes you gotta crash out, Sometimes you gotta crash out and show niggas. That's it. On your birthday, When are the appropriate times to crash out When the camera's off? Nighttime, anytime at night. Preferably pass 11 o'clock. Crash out When. I. Crash out in the morning man. Nah. Crash out whenever you feel like crashing out man. Crash out right before you go to bed. Nah, you be up too much. Never crashing out before bed. Do It early in the day so You can blow off that steam.

You wanna drink? Like how you I hate being in the room when that happens because they're not sitting there like this. I sit there with a face. You can't say nothing. Isn't nothing You can say yo. Yeah, Something is wrong with That. Ignorant. Yes. Yeah. Nigga It is, but It is funny though because that's what you feel you trying to say. Do y'all believe that Tyrese is bitter? I feel like Tyrese is affected by his divorce.


No. Ready to do some, I don't necessarily see bitterness ready to do some po I think he's, who's ready to do some po bitterness in more regard? Do bitter like the Oxford definition of the word bitter. He don't, you don't. Nothing gives bitter from Tyrese. I don't think He's bitter. But I don think he's affected by his divorce. So bitter Is that bitter. Don't Necessarily gotta be bitter. Oh man, I hate when we gotta do this man. Yo, it's bleak. So y'all put nigga, Google it, nigga walk in the other room and find your fucking Cox. How about that? Google it bitter. I mean I think his divorce has added a long lasting effect. Gotta get over. Yeah. I had fuck. Get up now. Yo. Shut the fuck up.


Stuck in the middle. you know what bitter is? And you know I sound when a nigga is bitter. Tyrese came in over a year ago with the same shit. And that's my man friend of the show. But last time, for the last five years, you've heard Tyrese. He sounded like he's not healed from whatever his situation was with Shirley dp. Yes or no? I don't think he's healed. Yes. No, you right. And when he speaks about it, there is a undertone of bitterness. Bitter. Hold up. Let me look it up for the fucking don. Dont think out there, don't think he's, he's s up for the people out there. 'cause they wanna look at me like I'm crazy. But if he's still going, having a harsh disagreeable taste like that of aspirin, Quinn, whatever That is worm whatever.


Quinine, quinine producing one of the four basic tastes in six. No. Hard to bear. Grievous. Ful. Yeah. Causing pain. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Stinging. Yeah. Okay. Piercing hard to admit or accept. Characterized by intense antagon antagonism or hostility. Seven. Resentful or cynical? I asked my distinguished cast on our bleep list episode. Does tyreese seem bitter? Yes. But? yeah. The definition yes. Says it pretty, pretty clear. Yeah, bitch.


Yeah, he trying to kick, he trying to get to find the other definition. He trying to go, nah, he trying to get a good ary. Nah, I wasn't even doing that. I was saying that prior to him having a divorce, he was doing some of the same shit. Dog. He was in the crying in the phone and doing all that shit. Pre-divorce. So, I don't know if the divorce necessarily has him bitter or he just be going through emotional shit that he can't necessarily control. Isn't he still Going through it with her Though? Who? With the wife. With the Wife. Now I, I'm saying I be liking, I be liking the ex-wife shit on Instagram. I didn't know that. The ex-wife is the ex-wife. Yeah. Like she just be on my feed as a beautiful woman who be be talking that shit. Her rant. Yeah. Yeah. I was following her before he came up here.


I didn't know that was his wife. Yeah, I, I didn't know either. Even if I knew that before. Maybe I forgot it. You get what I'm saying? But, But looking at her, I see, I see how, I see how life can come and duck. Yeah. I could see how if you follow her You can see how he might go misery duck. I can see how he got caught in a little, in a little, in a little spin. Little tail spin. Yeah, I could see it. Yeah. And I'm not saying that something's wrong with being bitter. Don't, don't mistake what I'm saying. Like he might be rightfully So, I think it builds character. I think plenty of men have left a relationship or gone through something in life where they had a divorce. Bitter failure. Divorce is probably bitter.


Like, and I imagine divorce to be bitter. I've never gone through it because up, don don't know. If I'm looking at marriage When, I'm 70. you know, I mean, holler at me. When. I need When. I need some aid by the bed. Hey fund you aid Nicole. Hey, hey, I'm, I'm talking about a hundred, 200, $300 million. We trying to get outta here. Yo. Wait, what are we talking about man? Right.

But Is it working? What do y'all think about? I think it's working. Yeah. It might be working. I think It's working now. Might be worse because now they're starting to be more repetitive in the, in the news cycle. But shit, Whatever work, get it done. Do y'all care about juvenile getting kicked off American Airlines? I was. He Didn't get kicked off. He, he de boarded because they wouldn't have remove him from first class to coach. He did not get kicked off. Off. He decided off, he decided to leave. Why? Why They wanted to. So they, he kicked him off The airplane. Why? They wanted to take him off first Place. The seat that he purchased, they took him out of, And he was with his wife. Right. They let I don let his wife stay. They let his wife stay. Oh, I didn't know he was with his wife. Yeah, he was With his wife. His life stay. I only know about the clip that, you know, he put out or TMG put out. Yeah. So Him and his wife were sitting together.


They weren't gonna move her. They was gonna let her have her seat. They were just moving him back to her. Why would they Move that? What was the reasoning behind it? Nope. They, nobody ever said, you know, These airport airplane companies be, have some bullshit. Never probably double booked the seat or some shit over. So they don't really be doing that first. Usually They Don't do it with first. They don't do that. The first, for the most part, they don't do that. The first What if somebody with more miles came in? There Could have been that. What, what somebody was on standby with more Miles Ain't on standby, make a bonus Platinum member somebody with one of them that, that number one important card where you gotta spend like $90 million to have that card. One of them came in, Hey Juvenile, you gotta get up. And his argument was, yo, you of all the people on the plane, you picked a lone black famous person on the plane to remove something's.


Funny about that. Yeah. He said, I've never rode rode coach my life. I respect him for getting up and leaving So I Respect him for getting up and leaving too. I think it was a short flight too. I can't remember where he said it was going, but it Was, and, and I would have my attorneys on the phone. Fort Worth. Yeah. On in Fort Worth. Did, did American Airlines ever apologize? He's pretentious. Fuck What? They can't even move your seat. You won't call your lawyer on them niggas. You Nigga, if I paid for the seat, I paid for this. Take one of these white people. Take Karen and send her to the back. You gonna call your lawyer on American Airlines? You motherfucking Versus you just calling American Airlines and explaining the discrepancy and asking what they're gonna do to rectify it.


You gonna call your lawyer? No, my lawyer's gonna get it rectified. You don't think? Do you think that's Karen Ish? No, I think that's me taking advantage of an opportunity. That would set them straight for years to come. Like Karen's no, no. Like Karen's be doing dumb shit. Unjustified. I'm talking about yo, y'all arbitrarily picked me to to, to go to the back. Why y'all ain't pick somebody else in first class to go To the back and I'm flying with someone else. So why would you separate us When? you could have separated somebody or you could have moved somebody back dead By themselves. That was dead by themselves. That, that alone is crazy. Like What y'all did went in the back and did a lottery on who y'all picked. Well It gets crazier before that. 'cause why are we booking with American? Well, Sometimes it's the only option unfortunately.


And if that was the case then I'm letting it rock. But American, this sound like some American Airlines bullshit. So they, American Airlines ain't one of them. Mm. You not going to the back if they ask you to, to go to the Back. I'm not getting on American Airlines, Joe. If it's the only flight out, There would be no opportunity to have that conversation. He, I think he had a show or something. So if it's the only flight out, maybe he didn't book it. Don don't do shows. When's the last time you flew America? come on Joe. I flew America This weekend. That's why I got stuck. It was this year And what happened? Nothing. I got where I was going and I left. But it wasn't my, it wasn't my preferred. Preferred. It might not have been his preferred. He just had to go do some business. But if I'm going to sit, I'm talking about me now, not juvenile.


Gotcha. Because he's an OG and I love him. Yes. Shout to him. Yeah. Shout to him. Dude. What you want me? I'm gonna move to the back. I want to, my, my main objective When I step on a flight is to go home. Yes. I wanna also be respected, but I know that standing up for it in that moment is gonna cost me a lot more than me just moving to the back and getting home. That's me. When. I. Get on the plane. I'm trying to go home. That's me with your Girl, with you. Don don't know if you were that LA you never going to the back of no Coach Joe. They're not Joe. You six feet Weren s in that car On your knees. You're not gonna, I can fly coach. I'm not above flying Coach Joe. If you and Sade was, was on that plane, you're not allowing them to move you to the back for coach to still let her sit there.


You're not allowing 'em to separate you. And Ang I think when people tell y'all who they are, y'all don't believe it. But you do that all the time. Ask yourself that. No, but he Telling I don, I do that. Y but maybe he's, if y'all tell me something about y'all, I take y'all at y'all word 'cause y'all are my friends and I love y'all. You Did that shit about 15. I feel like clunking you with These shit falls violence. Talking about short term memories. I don know what these niggas mad at out here. You never know where the smoke is coming from. That's God. Yeah. I have no idea. Yeah, I would've got off the plane. I Would, I've done it before. You'd have got off the plane. I Would've got off the plane to prove a point on principle. I would've got Off the plane. Alright. The next flight is five hours later. Alright. Alright. What? I got time. What if It's an emergency? Yeah. Alright, see that We changed Now When, you start putting other things in. We have To ask that though. It well, what I said was, I'm getting moving to the back 'cause I want to get home immediately.


That's not enough for me. I was going make my principal known and I was going to hit my lawyer and all of that. I'm, you think, but you have to go to success. But you're walking off the flight. So now you, you now, now the rest of the flights, it's summertime. Hold up man. Hold up for a second. Hold up for a second. Ish. Hold up for a second perspective. Not only is it summertime, we about a week away from Labor Day weekend, which they are predicting to be the heaviest, busiest, traveled weekend in the year. They're expecting more than 18 million. Yes. 17 million travelers. Wow. The little TikTok niggas have a TikTok trend now where, you know, When, you pass TSA and put your shit in the bucket.


The TikTok niggas are now filming that. So they're making the bucket color coordinated, organized so they can film it, which is holding up traffic for 17 million people that are traveling. If flights are sold out, like we just finished seeing with the storms, I think Parks came. Yeah, I got stuck. The storms fucked people up. If flights are sold out and yes, I'm making up a scenario, but a realistic one, if flights are sold out and shit is overbooked 'cause of the weather, you could be jamming yourself up doing That is all I'm saying. And it's waking up with two fucking, if it's worth it to you, then it's worth it to you. I'm not trying to change your mind, but it could get tricky as you're traveling, heading into the Labor Day weekend is all I'm saying Juvenile, it's juvenile.


Me, you have to weigh all things. Of course, if you going home and your daughter got a ballet recital that you have, like, that's a whole different ballgame. We, we at, I'm talking about in a normal space under normal circumstances. And it's not Er, it's nothing. Nothing. I'm not going, yeah. I'm not going to coach out of principle. And it's not even about me. Antico, I paid for a first class seat. It's me and my wife sitting here. You're not gonna pick me up and leave my wife here and put me in coach. But they, But they Pick one of them motherfuckers. But they gonna bust it back to you with interest. I don't want your money. Everything ain't for sale. My, my, my nigga, my dignity not for fucking sale. You not gonna put me in a backend coach when I'm sitting here with my wife ready to go to sleep on this fucking flight.


In closing. You do view that as a dignity kind of move. Yes. You, you view that as you losing dignity by moving to the bat. Like it's Rosa Parks Ish. You see he's gonna take advantage of It Is to get to the back of the plane   type shit. Yeah. Yes. Like do you think it I'm serious. Yeah, no, no. I'm, I'm answering you. Yes, because again, if you View it like that then I, It's eight people or 12 people in, in first class. How did you come up with me? I would want to know that first Scissors paper rock.

It's maybe something that You can consider. If I'm there with somebody and I'm flying with somebody. No it's not An option. I've been in situations again. Not talking about y'all And what We talk, I've been in situations where, on the flyback with extreme circumstances with first class tickets. Now they gotta split you and your girl up. Hey, there's only one seat here. What you gonna do? You gonna wait for the next one or, or one of you gonna And I always offer the first one I'm getting on. Yeah, I'm getting on. I'll take that. I'll take that, give her that and I wanna go. But that's cool though. That's Cool. I know it's different. I know it's different. Yeah, I know it's different. I've done that. It's A different thing from sitting on the seat getting ready and pulling up and then now being told I get up dog. My bag under here.

There was a few years of my life where if Delicious was booked somewhere, I was gonna just stop by and and say hi.


'cause I fuck with Delicious. You gotta see it in motion. And I'm not talking about it like physicality. You gotta see the movie play out in person my nigga. Really? What? Yes she is of that level to whereas if I leave the Detroit studio to run to the strip club, she might be booked in. Everybody in there is going to be mesmerized by whatever is going on in there.

Like Oh if you ever speak to Delicious, she will tell you that there's absolutely nothing between Joe and I. Because I'm not saying there Was something between you. I'm not trying to pretend I don't do that. I don't do that. I make you think I fuck something that I didn't fuck. No, I understand. That is not what this is Delicious.

So you can't say, yo, can you stop doing that? So what Happened when your girl came outside? Ha Joe, Stop Fucking touching me like that. I'm telling you how it goes. What happened when your girl came outside? Nothing. She sat there and joined the conversation. Oh, so and then we walked Delicious to the gate and Delicious left And then I might add, might had a talk afterward or two And you don't play. I don't play like that no more. Oh, for okay. Kind was damn delicious to your house while your girl was On crazy.


I didn't know. See, I didn't know she had to talk with you or you had to talk with her. Joe, Follow Delicious. No, I'm not talking about You can go that page. You talking about the trance shit, I didn't know. 'cause there's certain people, people in the industry talk about that, that embody that shit. Like nigga, you get into a conversation nigga, you be like, oh, I get it. Yeah. I didn't know she was one of those. That's dope. Salus Ray. He, I mean, Nigga Raymond came right home and got locked in again. Well the different warden. That's A good, what the fuck do you think? Shout to Raymond. Shout. Delicious man. Anyway, moving on. We was off on a tangent. Were, I don't know why we were talking about we IC To DC, we went to the the DC y'all. come on.


I'm talking to my So. I was mentioning how the Central Park five was up there and they made a very big statement of, you know, a big part of why they feel they were put into the position they were put into and, and made to look like the criminals that they were made to look like was because of Trump. Trump did a big campaign that when they got arrested, put up a billboard saying that he wanted them to, he took Out front, he took out front page ads on every major publication in New York City. He spent I think a hundred K or a million dollars on each ad. Some shit like that. Maybe a hundred K back then. And he was Trump was him. Yeah, like back in the day, Donald Trump had swag. That nigga had charisma. He was him. So he on His dick.


What'd say Hip hop was on his dick? I I just recognized When, You one of them. Hiphop was one of them. But he put, when he took the ads out in the paper that basically, you know, was a catalyst in encouraging people just to convict these boys. Yeah. you know what I'm saying? Without even looking for the evidence he was saying Execute them. He was saying a whole, He was saying kill him. Didn't even take it a step further. Ice. Shout out to ice. When they came home and they had been proven innocent, he still, he still stood on his square and said that he don't think that they innocent. He still thinks that they good do it and he not recanting nothing that he's ever said about them. Yeah. Bullshit. So that's crazy to me. So it was good seeing them up there and you know, that was, that was a great moment. Al Sharpton had a really great speech.


He got people riled up. Hey yo, AKI. What? Michelle knocked the ball out the park dog. She Did other day. I'm talking about yesterday. Yesterday. But Michelle, but Obama and Michelle, I mean, yeah, they both killed that rock and Michelle killed that. And what I love about Michelle was rest in peace to when they go low, we go high. Let's, Let's Box now. Now it's when they go low, we go to hell. We needed that from Michelle Obama. come on. Yeah. That Was dope. No doubt The Democrats would be on some sucker shit. They Do. That Was dope suckers. Whoa, whoa, whoa. They'd be on some sucker shit. Whoa. They do. Okay now what are he doing in the booth? What? Don't just the Democrat while Black lady run.


No, I'm not, I'm saying we need that type Of energy. Yeah. Punch you back. Sometimes the Democrats be like, no, it's all right. Yeah. Passer passing shit nigga, let's fight. you know what I'm, I'm not gonna lie. The energy, the, and watching the energy is good. It is different. It would change. It was good. Now that shit Looked like a way better party, I'm not gonna lie. Oh, for Sure. For sure. Yeah. No it did for sure. It looked a lot better than when Dukakis was running. Yeah. Yeah. They made, they made some changes. I was sitting there waiting for Beyonce. Same. I was, I was watching the McNair shit. Had the, I watched YouTube on mute, I watched as well. Yeah, that was, that was good. That was sad. I watched The McNair shit, Steve McNair. I thought they could've did a much better job. Steve McNair. Yeah. Steve McNair on Netflix.


What? I felt like it was rushed. Oh, I felt like it was rushed. I felt like there was a lot of unanswered questions. I felt like there was some people that could have put a camera on that they didn't. That story. I've seen the Steve McNair story done before. A million times never done in 50 minutes. That could have been a series. I agree with you on that. Yeah. It Too many parts that never done in 50 minutes. That was, that was a fast, quick, Hey, before I go to bed, let me put this on. And it's like, come on, don't do that. Don't do that. Netflix. But it Was cool. Netflix don't usually do that. They usually give you, that's, They stretch that What I'm, something seemed funny about how that negotiation went or the taping don don't know whoever they hired to get that done. Something seems funny about that. There was more to that story than 50 minutes to an hour worth of doc.


That's all I'm saying. Well they also never really particularly led you to a answer. Really? Yeah, but I don't, I don't think they really had answer. I watched Some other shit. It was like that too. It was called Wit Wit End on Hulu. Yeah. That was actually really Ridley Scott did it and that shit is, the production was absolutely phenomenal. But it was kinda like, all right, but we don't know still. Okay. I don't, well I don't know how we got there from the DNC But. yeah. And yeah, DNC was interesting. It was dope. A lot of people did find himself disappointed that Beyonce wasn't there. And then also a lot of people did question. Okay, what was this about? Like what are we pushing? What's the message? I mean, well we got a slogan, but what is the plan behind, you know, this, this movement.


I Still have to watch her speech, but I heard that her speech delivered some points that she, I did Is standing behind. So, Well I will say this, This, the criticism on her has been a little bit, and, and It is unfair to me. It is that she just got nominated a couple weeks ago. you know what I'm saying? Shit is flying at a, at a, it been a month. No, I'm, I'm cringing at the word nominated. That's what it was. I'm, there was no, usually in a nomination you actually go against other people to see if you're even qualified to be the top pick.


So they nominated her to represent the demographic. Right. Sometimes The MAs gotta get scrambled buddy, But We gotta eat fast. She was just, she was Moving, had to make Move. She was moving mad fast. So And she raised enough money. Yeah. So they like, so they like yo dog, she's not being as definitive about what she is and is not gonna do. And I'm like, yo dog, they nominated me today. I'm fucking on planes tomorrow for the next three weeks. don don't even think she really had the opportunity to sit down and to prep for the, and process what's going on. you know what I'm saying? So I think that's a little bit unfair criticism. But some of the things she said thus far, I really, really like. And some of the shit I said that she said I, I I hate.


So we'll see where the ball Bounces. I watch, I watch both. I did watch Republican. All the, all the stuff Trump will do. I watch this, I will say this taken back everything I said I'm gonna vote, I'm gonna vote. I'm not saying who I'm voting for because that's my, but I do think, I do think at some point we gotta figure out what what side we lean on with this a little bit. Alright, but you can't vote for Rocky. Why? Huh? Huh? You heard what he said? What He said This nigga. What'd you say? She not running podcast? Yeah. What'd you say? I didn't hear what you said.


It's bleep Listless thought you had to be there to catch up. It just believe with But you can't vote. She's not running. It was funny. Yo you ain't Shit. It was just funny. It was just funny moving on. Piece of shit. Moving on on with podcast. Moving on. Sky's A nut case Yo. Alright so what else? What else is important or unimportant? You, you had mentioned, damn, you mentioned something. Yeah I wanna check somebody real quick over Some shit. Yeah she did mention you had a docket. No Novo and I went, I only play this. Do You know who's not really clear until they're unhappy us. Oh no that ain't my clip. Let me go find my clip. So I can fire Mandy right quick before Mel get back while I look for my clip or I found my vibes clip if you wanted to know what happened.

Oh no actually no it's not Vibes Cartel The hat, that's The right clip. Michael Jackson and El Chapo have in common. You ask nothing, stop playing around. But you know who has something in common with Both my man, this Guy Vibes cartel, the Hannah Montana of Jamaica, musician by day Gang shot collar by night. But see Vibes Cartel had a problem. His double lives were starting to Collapse. Yeah, no I. don You about to don't Play with vibes. I'm not playing that shit nigga. I seen him in the gym doing leg day nigga. Yeah, I'm chilling. don don't want no small. Where's my clip? Where's my clip?


I gotta check some shit. These niggas sitting around here pussyfooting around. I got some shit to get to. Let me see where my shit, with all this support I'm getting Niggas Nuts. Yeah, look at all this support. How much you, how much did you clip up? Look at all this Me. Yeah. Mad Clips. Mad Mad Clips. Here we go Of Joe, if you wanna bring up Joe Complex, he didn't get what he wanted so he sabotaged the possibility of everyone else in that space making money from the cameraman to the show runner, to the producer, to all of his other co-host.


Deep Breath. We good. Well I normally don't clear these types of things up, but this year I got time cause I got time cause rest in peace I got time. Cause dude I got a little bit of time. 'cause if you let some of This shit go unchecked, it'll just be unchecked and I feel like people try to get shit off. 'cause I'm, I'm in the, I'm in another, another realm so I'm supposed to behave a certain way because the game is the game.


But fuck that shit. Fuck that shit. I'm checking shit today. It is of Joe. If you wanna bring up Joe, This is man D on the Need to Know podcast. He Didn't get what he wanted so he sabotaged the possibility of everyone else in that space. Make, Let me pause this again. Sorry y'all, y'all can go get something to drink nigga. I'm listen y'all, y'all can go get a sandwich. We here, I wanna pause this again to let our audience know that many of the people that you see publicly speak about Joe Button have absolutely no place to speak about Joe Button. They do not know Joe Button's business dealings. They don't know my personal dealings. If you don't see people with me, they cannot speak on me or about me with any credence.


Of course people can do what they want, but I'm bringing this clip back again to check. Just this is nuts that she tried to get some of this off Complex. He didn't get what he wanted so he sabotaged the possibility of everyone else in that space. Ugh, that's incorrect. That is incorrect and That is a problem in podcasting where we only know what we know about people. So you, you, you develop a large audience and nobody knows your credentials or your qualifications to be able to speak of something to this level in the White House.


They have different levels to the information. You can access shit in a club. You get certain wristbands so you know where You can go and where you cannot go. This is all cap my perspective. When I do these shows and When I know and When. I go negotiate is if you don't have money for me to, you don't have money for a show. I normally speak from the perspective of somebody that created the show, negotiated my shit, negotiated everybody else's shit, negotiated the budgets like I normally speak from a whole different space with complex. If I didn't get what I was looking for, one of two things are gonna occur.


Either the show was going to completely end, which it did not, or a fucking ton of money just got freed up. In which instance everybody can begin to make more money than they were. This is Ka this is not factual what Mandy is saying and Mandy has absolutely no business speaking on Joe Button business. I'll let this clip continue making Money from the cameraman to the show runner, to the producer, to all of his other cos you know where else he did the same too, where they've actively spoken out about it. Ebony k Williams and what happened with the Revolt Show. I'm so glad you brought up Ebony k Williams and the Revolt Show.


Let's hear what she has to say. Joe Didn't get what he wanted. So because you're not giving me what I want, fuck what everyone else is making. There's That is It is it just what No, don't save me Avon, I appreciate you, you threw a wonderful mixer, but don't save me again. Mandy is misinformed with state of the culture and Ebony k Williams, Ebony k Williams came to interview for the job and was told by higher ups people with more authority than myself that you were too old for this gig. She was told you didn't look the part, you didn't dress the part, you didn't sound the part, you didn't talk the part. We're trying to reach a younger demographic and you look a little too mature for what we're trying to do.


And they sent Ebony k Williams along her way. If you ever happen to speak to Ebony k Williams, You can ask her these things. Everything I say is documented, even though they think I'd be lying about some shit. That was me who made some calls to say, Hey, in spite of you thinking that she's for an older audience, I think that she is exactly what we're looking for. I think that That is who we need to hire. If we need to get a stylist or a different makeup person or a different hair person to fix this and frame it the way we're supposed to, then what do you wanna do? I think that's what needs to be done. This is the person we need for the job. Sure enough, Ebony k Williams got that job and her stock increased and she left there and went on to do great things after this show ended.


I need to end some of these narratives that people that have no business speaking about my business put into the atmosphere. She don't know shit about shit Mandy, when it comes to me. And I'm saying that respectfully 'cause I fuck with Mandy, but I don't know what talks are going on in the girl's bathroom. you know, you know, people take a walk sometimes to get they shit off. Ebony has gotten her shit off for a little while. And because I'm the exec that I am, you know, it's, you know, you know, just don't do that. But Mandy could not be painting this to be any further from the truth than, than, than, than, than than what It is. If I leave state of the culture, they're not continuing state of the culture without me.


It's my show. I brought it here. It's my ip. If if I, if I'm not getting what I want, that means that there's not enough money here for anybody to get what they want at the end of the re-up. There's no more, all of the 70 people that's making breakfast in the morning that has to be paid for all of the stylists and the clothes and the makeup and all of This shit. All of that needs to be paid for. There's some people that are tasked with these responsibilities and there's some people that are not. Mandy, your version of this Ebony kay story is false. It's ka it's wrong. And frankly, it's none of your business. I'll let it continue.


I want, or is it what I am worth and what I deserve? Because that's two different conversations. you Know what that reminds me of? NFTs? Did we not see Nft? They're only valued at what the fuck someone is willing to pay for. And this is the fucking problem when y'all get to listening to people who are running successful businesses because Mandy is, but this is a horrible analogy and a horrible example. And me and the way my business runs should have nothing, nothing to do with NFTs in their values. you know what? Wait, wait, wait. Ill let it continue real Quick, real quick. Let me not No, you, I I won't allow you to say that because that's fine. When it comes to NFTs is they, you, the the market can gauge your value with NFTs.


Thanks Avon. When it comes To Joe or anybody That's a creator, it's not point. My value is based on how many motherfuckers is tuning in, right? Clicking and listening and not for nothing. So I'm not gonna, that's not a oneone. And we and we not trying to toot nobody horn ahead. No, no. Avon and I were in there and We know what that podcast is. Let let, let's be very clear. No bullshit. I'm still in there. Which is which I Still No, which is, which is why this is why I can't hate Joe, right? This ain't about Joe for no Fuck, fuck the corporation. I'm gonna go behind the paywall. Let's pause it right there for a second. There's a community of y'all that cannot hate Joe because of the numbers that this podcast does. Because the way that this podcast performs and you would love, you would love for it to be any other way than the way It is.


I just wanted to check some of that just 'cause it's false. And because we know Avon and because people go see people that know me, a audience might see it and think that there's some type of social equity there for people to be able to speak on me in, in this manner. And this is totally unacceptable. Mandy would not understand the level to which I negotiate. Also, let me clear something up there. There's a slew of people out there running around talking about, I'm not sure if I could work with Joe again and another instance where I'm supposed to be professional and this executive and never say, never get on my Yachty bag and say, yo, anybody from my past, anybody that I have worked with before, if you don't see them around, the opportunity is not gonna present itself in the future for us to work together.


I don't have to speak about it. For me to acknowledge something and say, Hey, I've seen enough. I want to go a different route in the ways that we work. But there's some value in people out there dangling the carrot of the potential of working with Joe Button or the Joe Button podcast again, This shit is a farce. This shit is a farce. And we about to get in the fourth quarter and for 2025, enough is enough. Mandy, I love you all the respect in the world, Mel's not here. So we'll get to that issue at another time. But this is just a bunch of bullshit. No, for real. I be home on YouTube, I be listening like, and I fuck with Mandy. But this is totally, totally, totally unacceptable. And the fans don't know enough to know that Mandy don't know enough to speak to what I'm doing at this level.


No disrespect, you not gonna understand some of my thinking and some of my moves. Anybody that I have effectively fired, I hired them and it was my job to go and and and, and and get shit straight. Sorry you guys For what? Huh? I'm off a little For doing what you said Yachty shouldn't have did. I don't think I did that. don. Don't think I did that at all. You shouldn't me. Yeah. Shit You crazy one of these days. Boy, I just don't think that one of these Days. I just don't think that also it's come to my attention. Right? Right. I mean, I ain't mad at you. I mean, if you never fix shit, the lie just keeps going and going and going and going.


I don challenge becomes true. Yeah, I don't know what Ebony K told nobody, but I'm certain it's not. Hey, they turned me away because of my presentation. And Joe Button is the one that fucking hired me and went to bat for me as as Amanda didn't know me. That story is not told enough for me. Also, also also it has come to my attention that a few of you people out there think that It is key. Key time. 'cause LL came and brought me my gold plaque for Pump it up. Dun dun. Yeah, get to it nigga. Open the door. I'm a little slow.


How slow. So I'm the last to know that there are a few of you out there that are laughing at that gesture. And I want to be clear, everybody can laugh. If you sit up here and you dish it, you have to be able to take it. I stand in that I have said a bunch of shit about a bunch of people. My actions are not exonerated at all. Here I am clear on why people fire at me and I'm willing to stand there. But to the people that know me just a tad bit better, there's absolutely nothing You can say to make me think that LL cool j bringing me my pump it up gold plaque to my fucking triple, triple platinum or whatever quadruple platinum podcast is an L Hey, if if Pump it up sold one copy and LL walked in here and said, Hey, here's your one copy you sold and I want to sit down on your platform and talk to you.


The hip hop head that I am would take that to be the biggest of W's because of my queen's background and because of who I deem LL Cool J to be. Now, While we all can laugh and if there's anybody that I hope would be laughing It is Young Miami with all that she has had to endure in the past year or so, I wanna be clear, I like young, young Miami. I do, I wanna be honest here. And I think that she is a pretty good content creator.


What we do up here sometimes when things end as a ritual is to play another one. Bites the Dust. It's me. I'll take it. I'm a dick. I think it's funny. I just think it's a cool little segment when shit goes awry, I don't play it to personally attack anyone. And while I talk to Isha, I I'm, I'm not going to personally attack her because she is allowed to laugh and I like her. I think she's funny. I think she's great. Yada yada y Qualify, qualify, qualify, qualify, qualify.


The thing about laughter I think that she will soon realize is it's also a luxury laughter. I say all the time laughter is good for the soul slash the flip side of that laughter is also a privilege. So while I'm happy that Isha is able to laugh because she's had a stressful year, I am a little surprised that she has found enough time to laugh at anything. I I'm not gonna call you outta your name.


I'm not gonna be personal. I'm not gonna be disrespectful. I want to keep this professional. And on the music, if complex were to do a list of where all the female rappers rate Isha, you would be last on the list. You would be drop dead last on that list. Every female out there is wiping you down right now. And to the people that are lost, I'm saying this because Isha put the laughing emojis over LL handing me my pump it up gold plaque and do I believe pump it up to be a gold record?


No. And do I believe that everybody in the lunchroom can laugh at something That may be funny. No. No. Most of the lunchroom could get a good chuckle, but Isha was the very last person I expected to do this. Isha, not only may you be dropped from your label right now, but you are not allowed to put music out. There's nothing happening. I wanna remind you that today I hear pump it up more than I hear you. So while you go on these social media rants and say that you were nine years old with pump it up drop and now you're 30, you should be cautious of that because your record label today is saying to you that they're not seeing any growth Self-Admittedly, the only talent that you have possessed in recent years is providing emotion.


Yet you're at a standstill. I'm not talking city girls, I'm talking you. And that's my problem when it comes to current modern acts and the caricatures that you beat. Like I view you as a science project. And I'm not talking city girls because I'm a fan of city girls And I'm on J T's side in the breakup. But I love city girls and city girls has accomplished if few, no for real, JT came up here, hair flowing. You amazing. Like, like stop for a minute. I ain't stupid. I gotta I. gotta try to read between some of the social media shit.


JT came up here, skin glowing, hair glowing knee high boots with a staff that didn't look cheap. She did. She came up here talking that talk. She came up here with music circulating and everybody and everybody up here absolutely loved her. Yes. Here's the kicker. JT also has a nigga with all the money in the world, Right? JT is with somebody I fuck with jt. Throw the phone at that bitch at the award show, nigga. Yeah nigga. I'm repping for mine. JT got a nigga that got all the money in the world and still when the odds were against her got to it, she got to it For sure.


She got to work. Niggas laughed. Oh you doing a small venue child. Oh you flopped. Oh yeah. She came up here and got real, yo, our last project, it wasn't the greatest. And I had to go back to the drawing board and really find myself. I don't think Isha has the time. I don't think she has the time to laugh when it appears that she's going through an identity crisis. And that right there be my problem with y'all. I've seen y'all. I I am very familiar with this type, am familiar with the type that think they became the dick that they helped came. I'm very familiar with the bitches that think they have bloomed into who they consume.


Oh. wow, that Was good. You was running around here and you gave JT your ass to kiss. You sat there with saucy Santana who even raps better than your ass and gave JT your ass to kiss. You said I'm dating a billionaire now. Fuck that city girl. Shit, I'm off of it. We not making no money. I'm donezo here. You told shorty ua, you told homeboy's ex that if you felt like it, you could get a homeboy to get her on all fours and start sucking some dick or barking like a dog or some shit. You also told homegirl that because her carpet was fucked up, she was broke. And now when When, you start with me, you wanna say protect black women.


I don't want to hear none of that shit. You are the worst female rapper out there currently. And you don't write your own shit. These are science projects put together by people and companies with the best of the best surrounding them for them to get further. But as a standalone, nothing's ever happened. When JT went to jail, you kicked that shit. Yo I gotta wait for it to wait for it looks different now. Nothing was popping. You were on arguably one of the greatest fucking labels to ever exist next to who I would say is the second best group to ever come out of Atlanta.


Yet you still find yourself in this position. You was running around talking big, big, big, big shit. And I'm not mad. What I'm mad at is that you tucked whatever you was mad at. Like whatever I said that, that that drove you, that, that that drove you the wrong way or hurt your feelings. You tucked it until you saw like an opportune time. And somehow me getting a plaque is the opportune time to get your shit off. I don't really understand it. But I also don't think that you are the lawnmower with a steering wheel. I I don't think that you are the fucking don don't wanna say sharpest knife in the drawer.


I just don't How you view things is a little different from reality. You shouldn't have time to do a thing. You should have time to do absolutely nothing. But look around and see that all the people that was pumping money into me have stopped. I might be in the red. I don't have no motion out here and everybody else is up kicking ass. Where the fuck do you get time to tweet emojis? Girl, girl, girl. No, no, no. Let's get it down. No, she should stop. No, no. Everywhere. I'm gonna stop too now.


Yes, Yes. We should Stop. I would like to keep going But, but we but you should. Yeah. You did great. But it was Good. And the great words of my London nigga, you taking a piss? Oh, okay. You're Taking a piss. You joking? Oh, That's a double one. That was, that was real good. You, you might be able to still rap. That was good. That was good. Stop. I'm not trying to rap. I want to help her 'cause I like her. But y'all people out there that don't have a motor, y'all people out there that aren't very passionate, I don't need to speak to you to know about your passion for hip hop. I'm looking at your cadence.


It is cold as hell out there. And your hit show you can't put out. But once every fucking three or four months you need to get with your team. Recalibrate. Rethink some things. Redo some things. Hit hit the drawing board. Hit the whiteboard. The money's right. Maybe that was me. It Was, but it's cool. I mean I, I think the point is It is gathered and Kaisha, I love you and I want you to do well, but you shouldn't have much time to laugh at things Is all I'm saying. If this is love nigga, I don't want it. She just shouldn't have much time. If That's the type of love you giving, I don't want it nigga.


Every girl in the world out there is kicking up. Every girl in the world out there got a Big Mac deal. A fucking Starbucks deal. Reeses a fucking Popeye's chicken deal. Yeah. Angel Reese's Pieces deals. Yeah. Ranch Girls is out there selling dressing. They selling panties. They selling bras. They selling jogging suits. They selling workout clothes. Got realistic. You only one. Anytime we hear from you. Yeah, they selling makeup shit. Perfumes, colognes. Bitches is getting to it right now. We probably never seen a window where women have been able to get to it in the fashion that they're doing now in music. And you sitting somewhere laughing and broke.


Please. All of a sudden now you wake up early, now you wake up early enough to see the tweets. You've been asleep about five times when smoke was coming your way. But now you wake up early, nigga I seen you up at six o'clock in the morning giving out turkeys with puff. Watch your fucking mouth all All right. Watch your fucking mouth. Watch your fucking mouth When. you speak to niggas like me. Hello. Alright, let's stay with the love. Stay With love. Shout but That's love. No, I know, but it don, don sound like shout out to giving out turkeys. That's no, that's good. But that's going. Let's keep it with love. I love Kaha. I do. And I think she's talented. I think that if she got her motor together and her passion together, that she can get something shaken. My only point is Kaha baby, you don't have time to laugh.


Nothing should be a laughing matter with you. Got it. We got you. Oh, now they want me to stop. Nah, you gotta stop. You did it now you gotta stop. Look, look now It is number. He had to get them Puerto Rican niggas off me. Yeah. Fuck outta here. Yeah, you up. Your niggas mute up. Why I'm dead ass. Latto got you wiped down. Flo. Millie got you wiped down. JT got you wiped down. Ice Spice. Nicki Gorilla. Scarlet, Scarlet and Scarlet. Scarlet and Scarlet. Everybody has you wiped down Scarlet from G You don't Nigga going old going back.

Ain't never rode a bar, ain't never picked a beat all day. Just done had everything handed to you and then you want to get across socials and start talking to fucking self-made niggas. No, no, no, no, no. Respectfully, respectfully. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Niggas done been there before. Niggas, Hey, hey everybody out there if you up, you done met the girl and when she comes spend the night, when she wake up in the morning, you waiting for shorty to go to work. She say maybe I'll call out today.


Mm. What are you doing today? Maybe I'll do what you're doing today. This nigga was giving out turkeys at six in the morning. She went to the awards and held a fucking sign up in the air. Your label said that you lost your identity. Oh. wow. That's not us. That's what your label said to you and you in interviews saying that you providing the motion Good. Just pump it up. Ain't the only thing that was going go gold Yo. All right. You stop. You Got it. And again, listen, somebody, somebody hit me this morning and was like, yo, lay off Isha.

I gotta a birthday coming up too. Crash out. It's Virgo season For sure. Did I do that respectfully? 'cause I don't wanna disrespect or car out her name or none of it. Ain't it ain't that deep for me. No, the Little jokes Can come off. Not, it's not that personal for me. Even in her tweets I could see that she was just hurt. Yeah. So I. Think we gotta teach artists other ways to deal with hurt rather than come out niggas that have been doing this for fucking 25 years. Sorry.


Sorry. I'm gonna do this and go home to my Keurig. Make a little cop and go ahead and watch some tv. That's it. All right. That's all I got. Is there is am I the only one up here that the internet has said had something to say about this week? No. No you're not. No You. All right then moving on then. You Trying to treat me like male, like you trying to call Me out. I'm saying that Coton Carpet me to the carpet nigga. Is there anyone else here that the internet has had something to say about so they can respond or get their shit off on our platform in front of millions of people watching some of which, some of whom enjoy a really good mess.


And if that's only me, nah, that's willing to take it to the top on our bleep list episode, then I'll carry everybody on my back and do that. You can Maybe I have a cast don don that don't get shit shaken outside. So nobody says nothing bad about Y'all. That battery. I think I, I Think I maybe nobody says nothing bad about Y'all. I think, I think I Maybe everybody just talks great about y'all. I think I addressed any issue. Maybe I think I addressed any issue I had in the last part. Oh, not true. I think you did too. Yeah, I think I did. I think I addressed it like I did Was a bitch way to address Something Yo Joe names. If it was a bitch ass nigga way to address something, I think you did it manipulator. It's time for you can't manipulate me. Yeah, it's Time for manipulator. It's time for manipulator. Hell not, but you know, lemme say but lemme say something real quick.


I been frustrated this this week. I'm Getting at you too. You said What? I'm getting at you next. You ain't getting at me After him after he go You, you ain't getting at me After he go I'm getting at You. all right. Well I've been frustrated And I've giving you the three minute Grace. Don don't need none of that. Aki You can go down. You can skip him. So I what? Let him go and get Shit off. No man. He was In the kitchen yelling, screaming. I was doing a bunch Of words. He ain't hit nobody. I was talking to my friend Ish about how I felt about what was said on a podcast. I didn't like it. It's very vague. Don don't even know what he talking about. You know what I'm talking about don don't know.


I'm talking about what was said. I got, I got right to it. Mandy. Yo, this what I think Isha. Yo, this what I think, no, don don't know what I Said. Something that was said on Bag Field. Oh, okay. You know, don't breathe. you know, I was accused of something that I didn't do and I didn't like it. I felt like niggas tried to play with me. They didn't play with me in person when they seen me. And on top of that, niggas just, I, I wanna know what, what make a nigga feel that way. So, I was angrily or you know, just speaking to my friend Ish and Ish was telling him acting like a child. Wish I could see what he's saying because he has a way of conveying messages. But I was just, I I'm just upset because the fact that, you know, a nigga decided to play with me outta all people. Alright, before I get to joking around, I do agree with Ish that there is a mature way to go about things even in podcasting when there's something to dispute.


And I don't know if we do see enough of that in podcasting from the leaders of it. And fortunately for us, we are in the leader position. So. I feel like how, How, how, how we're used to how we're used to rectifying things and how we should go about rectifying things. I I agree with my older, my Older brother. No, no. Ish told me. He said I was acting like a child. My, you know, my thing is that I feel like that should go both ways. If you have an issue of, of there's some misunderstanding or miscommunication. You can always, you know them niggas got your number, they Got it number call find out yo, what's up with flip? you know what I mean? I feel like Esso, you know what he did was because I don't wanna do an interview on the show because I didn't wanna take a picture with them niggas and it's on YouTube because I didn't wanna do a couple of things.


And because probably I didn't acknowledge him. He used the opportunity of something that you said and put it on me. I think it's disrespectful. I'm not too proud to fix any mistakes that I might've made. Like even When, I went to go 'cause I had to go think about it. I was so mad. I was arguing with, with space. I was arguing, yelling at Heineken like I'm going to your, your your restaurant now. Like I was in my studio, I was in Brooklyn waiting and I went on my computer. I said I went to go look at the video that I recorded from the content created convention or the IFC. And I said well maybe the nigga felt like I didn't put his name 'cause it was his joint. But I didn't know. I didn't know the second time I knew it was his the first time. I didn't maybe that. But all you gotta do, if you see something like that, call nigga I'll fix it. I'm not too proud to fix anything that, 'cause that wasn't my intent.


What I do do is that I don't, if I don't know a nigga, I'm not really acknowledging niggas. If I don't know a nigga, I don't know him. My first time meeting him and he was nice. So for him to talk like that and play with me and he didn't play with me like that in person. I was passionate and felt away. I don't like that shit. These niggas can't take nothing from me. That nigga that y'all sit there and he record for y'all, nigga I gave him that name Space Ghost nigga. I was one of the hottest things that nigga was around period. I brought niggas up to Hot 97. I brought niggas everywhere. Nigga don't ever try to discredit me in what I do in this content space. Millions of views before I got up here and up here had put me on a bigger scale. But don't try to take nothing from me. Like I'm don don't wanna, I don't play around with nobody's content or what they do.


I'm just a nigga. I don't do interviews period. Anybody that know that, anybody who know me knows that don don't like to talk. I don't wanna talk about myself 'cause You can just watch me on my platform. I don't wanna sit down and be interrogated. My life is not something I wanna talk about at this point. don don't wanna like talking about my life up here. So it's not personal to anyone and it's not disrespect to them because Joe came up here and said he had a great time. Ish talks positive about them niggas, anytime I hear and I I, I know Heineken rest in Peace King face, anytime he was around it was great, me, him, Viv like so to have that much content or not content to have that much hatred, Vitriol, vitri, Vitriol vi's a good word while speaking about me. It's confusion.


Now I do agree with Ish. I do agree with Parks. I do agree with Joe. Flip calm down. But I feel like you trying to little boy me, I didn't tell you to calm down. I you Fight. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So. I am You Don't wanna fight. Forget it To, you know, to to even, you know, to speak up, to speak about me like that publicly to little boy me. I don't like that. Then I got mad at space like nigga you in the background chuckling and hyping it. I let you rock. A lot of times I let you rock with the shampoo shit 'cause I understood your frustration. I understood that yo, I didn't get paid from this nigga. He started making money and I helped the nigga start. I understand that. So get your shit off whatever you gotta say about me. But now you hyping other niggas. Yo car sun them or, or he's a troll. I'm not no troll. He told the da, he told the Danny nigga that and he said he keeps saying I'm a troll.


You see me punch niggas in the face before, stop telling these niggas on patrol. So they think they could play with me. Stop. I don't like it. I'm sorry I don't, I just don't like it. Don't play with me. So as far as the Esso shit concerned, I'm moving past it and I'm going private with it. I do feel a way and I still feel a way because I feel like why nigga think he could play with me like that period. I didn't say nothing. I'd rather a nigga tell the truth, yo you came in my event, you didn't acknowledge it was my event. Or you acting like you too good to sit here on my show. I don't like that. I accept those type of things. I don't think I'm too good but well I am too good now. But I didn't think initially At so bad fuel. It is Ish and let's get it together.


Yeah, I supposed Huh? You did. Yeah, let's get it together. That's it. Because you, because that niggas be liking it. Sorry because that, that's what I told Ish. He ain't like what I said. Yeah. It is not The people that I do like. don don't expect for them to beat. Right Is right. Wrong is wrong though Joe. you know that's wrong. I know So I think you Watched it. No, no, No. You're right. I'm not, I'm I do not disagree with Right is right and wrong is wrong. I do think there's a way to go about it when somebody is wrong. Especially when that somebody has close ties to somebody that I may love. I think it's A way to go about it Com Commodore called me and say, yo, you know what Flip I, I watched it and you ain't saying nothing wrong. I apologize. Commodore called me and apologizing me and I said y'all, I appreciate that Commodore.


I also think there's nothing wrong with both of y'all just not liking each other and maybe just being rubbed the wrong way by each other. Pause and then just decide. All right, we going to just keep, keep distance but the damages are being done. No, but, but at moving forward, if he would've called it say Yo, I really don't like, I would've fixed whatever. And then I know what It is that you went on there and try to demean my character. You have a nigga I worked with before playing around with me. I don't like that. Don't play with me Space Ghost. No, not to play with Me. The damage is done. But we got a contractor 20. He said he got 20. We got a contractor he gonna fix. He gonna fix the house. He Gonna fix that house. We gonna get the damage outta there man. All right man. Yo Tamron Hall. Oh said that yesterday.

I, it's A really amazing, I think that's healthy to Do A really amazing question. I think the answer I, I've had the conversation before. What's the que what question?

Alright, let me find a clip. I'm gonna find a clip talk. Leave me alone. Oh well Doc, well, Dr. Umar, Dr. Umar is on some bull Oh.


Shit. He, he, he, He feels as if hip hop hasn't really done any benefit for the black community. Here we go. Oh, Hip hop in 50 years has made sure that black people now are respected and no, that's not gonna Happen. What has it done for the people? It gave you, you listen to hip hop music and you were inspired at some point. No nigga, I'm leaking. We We're, we're ain't Done shit in 50 years for the community. They made individuals rich and that's It. It then gave jobs to it then gave jobs to, they Gave a couple times. I think this is a great topic. Amazing. I do think it's a great topic.


But the Drug dealer is, we, We both ain't, It is essential to the black community in the ghetto. You can't tell me that somebody grew in The hood. 50 years hip hop ain't done shit concretely beneficial to the black community. That's correct. You gave incorrect me fashion. Incorrect. The first thing thing outta your mouth was fashion. I, I gave you fashion and you started yelling over me. What else? But then also then, then there's technological advancement. Podcasting. Podcasting for example. Look at all the black people that now have access to jobs and a ways to make money due to that. We're still talking about rap, we're still talking about cinema, we're still talking about these camera operators. These tech, these new people come out. When You making real concrete for you?


I just Made a concrete. No, I, no, it wasn't, that was all bullshit. No give, You're about, say Give me a relevant institution Talking to him like you to this hip built In any community anywhere in America. I told fucking years. I told you, I told you. I just told you concrete people, That would not have acted. I didn't say Cut me, cut me off again. Institution. I said people, Where's the bank of the pot for the black community, The definition of the word people means not an individual. So I'm telling you people that are now, that now of 50 years ago, long Clip, but I'm letting it go. Words. I actually, what did they do for the community? You can't gimme nothing 'cause they ain't done. The people From the community can now work in a music industry that there was never going to be a space for them.


What the fuck? That's individualism. That ain't helping us. That's bullshit. No bull fucking shit. It's not helping us. No, what's happening is you right. Virtual signal. That's bullshit. Virtual signal happen. He's This shit. A few people could get jobs. A few. Everybody can say that shit. Elon Musk got a couple black people on a payroll that don't mean shit. Elon Musk didn't come from black could, he's not a black, But point is You can get a job from anywhere, whether they black or not. But now, Now black people. But You're still talking about individualism, bro. A few people. You've been around for 50 years. The most popular music genre in the world. Billions and billions of dollars.


And all You can tell me about is a few people can get jobs. That's bullshit. When. you look at the cost that the black community has had to pay for hip Hop. No, that's a good point. But he's still Wrong. A whole generation, two, three generations of black kids growing up thinking the best thing You can do is be a damn gangster. That's Not true. Ladies and gentlemen, That is Dr. Umar on what has hip hop done or has hip hop done more harm than good in the last 50 years? Dr. Umar, anytime I hear him is gonna articulate himself Well, he's an, even if he, he an extremely intelligent genius brother. I just disagreed with everything he Said.


You still gotta be open to dialogue. And so every single time Mouse start to talk, he cut him off. He didn't let him. Yeah, that's true. Convey his points. He Dismissed him. Yeah, He cut him off. It's a difference in being dismissive both and being rude in cutting him off. I think that hip hop has definitely been detrimental to our culture, but I also think that hip hop has When. you start defining community. If hip hop gives, man, Sherry Bryant was a motherfucking intern. I don't know what her check look like. I don't know nothing. I know. I would assume she's paid very, very well. You owe that to hip hop. LL cool J came and sat up here. You owe that to hip hop. And so the trickle down are their children are their family members, et cetera, et cetera.


That might've opened businesses, that might've bought property that might've done a whole bunch of things. It's, it's, it's spiderwebs that come from hip hop that are beneficial to the black community. Just because you don't know of them, that don't mean that they don't exist. I think he's Speaking about the music that's, that's currently, He's not even, he not, he said 50 Years. Ha He not even qualified enough to speak on the music board. That's true. Having a hold on. Today's society where the kids are killing each Other. He's not qualified. But that wasn't 50 years of hip Hop on on. That's, that's not how hip hop begun. But That's currently cool. Currently the music, the drill music and the music That is Happening. And that's not currently, there is no drill rap on the billboard top 20.


It's not a one. See don don't think, don don't even think It's not a one. I know that there's storylines that go out because of propaganda. It's detrimental and shit do be happening. Okay. There are no drill drill shit. The mayor was just talking about drill might not be here no more drill. Don't speak for all. And my problem with what he's saying, or in the point that they arguing is community versus individualism enough individuals is what a community community. That's, that's where my problem. And then you have it. That's where my problem is with now. And, and, and the tentacles that reach from one person could positively affect a hundred people or a thousand people that you just don't see. And so, listen, Dr was not, he's not talking about, and don don't agree with him, but I think the problem is that Mouse is having one conversation and Dr.


Umma is having another one. Do let him talk. Well, no, no. What I think the points, what's happening is Dr. Omar always speaks from the point of how do we move as a people moving forward, not just affected in hip hop, just, just politically, everything. He almost, to me that sounds like more of a political conversation for him than It is an actual hip hop culture conversation. He's trying to say all these things that we've been able to achieve individually and as a community within hip hop might be cool for that. But what has it done for us in 50 years of a culture moving forward just as a people. Cool. Which, which I still, I still disagree, but I just think he's up there having a different argument in comparison To my, well one, I don't, I don't feel like hip hop, I don't feel like hip hop should bear the responsibility of how to save black people as a whole in this world.


That's True. But even that's one He's still wrong. No, no. He's definitely wrong. He's still wrong. You can definitely Wrong. You can name. Alright, so y'all gonna say, I'm Jay-Z Stan. So I'm gonna go to Nas. Nas has invested in the ring. Yes. Right? Yes. Nas has invested in a whole bunch of shit that Dr. Umar may not know he's invested in. If Nas employs a thousand people, those thousand people's kids could potentially go to college based off of NA's employing them. But who's saying that? That he's employing Black people on? Hold on, lemme jump in wham, real quick. That's part of my issue with Dr. Omar. He sound like somebody that, that ain't so aware. you know how I used sat here last part and was like, I like the music, not the culture. Yeah.


That's what he sound like. That is That is what Dr. Who sound like. I agree with that. When we went to the Lucky Day show, whenever the fuck we went and security pulled our truck in. And then another, he handed us to another security. And then we went upstairs and there was the ushers and the p people working in concession stands to Isha Point. The first thing I thought was, damn man, look at all these people that are able to be employed from this show. Black people, people that look like us, people where the economy is fucked up. And they get into it because there are artists that are traveling state to state, city to city, country to country. I'm talking about the, the, from the security to the stage handlers to the sound engineers, to the mixer board people, JDA, kissing them, got a coffee.


You don't know how many fucking people that employees, you understand what I'm saying? Jay-Z and them give scholarships away every fucking year. The kids to go to school that could have potentially not gone to school had they not got that. You understand what I'm saying? And, and all fucking 40, 40 had mad black people employed at 40 40 at one point in time. All of these separate entities. Ish, can I ask You? can I And Oh, go ahead. Go ahead. And if we just speaking about, well that's, you said what you heard from Dr. Umar many times, When, I, hear Dr. Umar's message It is build community through school and the food and farms and yada, yada, yada. But what I hear is how do we buck today's system?


That's what I hear in what he's trying to do. Hey, the systemic oppression is wrong. And how they running This shit is wrong. And we need to find a way to buck that to speak against hip hop. Hip hop was that way for urban or impoverished voices marginalized all over the world to unite and kind of shared the story. It hip hop was almost like the first Twitter. Twitter to me, arguably was one of the greatest pieces of, I think Parks said it, the journalistic tools that we've ever had. Hip hop was that when African bear body and them start talking about what's going on over here, and then these niggas start talking about what's going on over there, that's one too.


All of the lives, That is saved. That turns into community. But we need not just, Dr. Umma always speaks about generational wealth. So for him to discount, for him to discount all of the black, brown, white, anybody that even has remote success in hip hop, to create that generational of wealth, to sell their catalog, to sell their publishing, to hand down. Yo, just last week I saw we, I saw Isaac Hayes's son send a cease and desist to Donald Trump. Trump Donald Fucking son. Because you're playing my dad. Yes. Like some of the mistakes that happened back in the day with with with how we were conned out of our land. Like some of our great greats.


Right. And hip hop today. Some people are getting a redo of that. So it may be a alternate route than what Dr. Umar be talking about. It's not building the school, building the supermarket building and such and such. But trust and believe. There are some colleges out there fucking prestigious colleges that are hiring people that look like us just to teach musicality. That's true. Just to teach the language. Tupac had a class, they had a Tupac class in major colleges. Dog. They had a white girl the other day, a white teacher the other day. I thought this was the cutest thing in the world. If I cried for white people, I would've shed a little tear. But she was doing the teacher version of of the sexy red song. Yes. What?


Yeah. Who ready to do some math? I mean geometry. Yeah. All the kids together and whatever she was saying. Right. Like so a lot of the thing, a lot of the principles that Dr. Umar enforces, I'm not sure if he's aware that he's contradicting or discounting those things because we talking about hip hop and maybe the only hip hop he here is gun gunna shoot him down, bust him, bust him bust. He's missing a lot of hip hop. If that's the only hip hop he's ever heard, He can't be because he's our age. He might have missed something. And so hip hop in the eighties, he's from Philly, my nigga. So hip hop in the eighties, Dog. He was at Philly trying to get to school. He was in Philly trying to do this. He was in Philly. Fuck. I can't speak to what hip hop he inherited is all I'm saying.


So I don't know how much fucking, I think, I think Dr. Umar enjoys hiphop. Yes. I think he enjoys it. I think there's hiphop that he does listen to that he's enjoys. I do think that pushing that message, and I'm willing to be wrong, but I think pushing that message really just plays into him. Needing people to really just believe in what he believes is gonna be the cure to fixing our community. But the he does not believe That. Dr. Umar, your message ain't even as loud as It is without hip hop At all. At All. Your message ain't loud as It is without hip hop. That's true. Is So I mean? Hip hop is the conduit for many, many, many, many things. It's the entryway for many things. I I just don't agree unfairly don don't agree with how he's Speaking about. And unfairly, yo hip hop is only 50 years old.


That's fairly young. Especially when the people that were the artists didn't control it, didn't own it. Now you see people starting to get ownership. Until your point, dog generational wealth takes a chance to be seen. It ain't gonna just be seen immediately. No, I don't like, you know what I'm with you. Why? I don't like the hip hop kid getting that. Because let's just say for the normal kid in the hood, what's your way of getting out the hood? It's either hip hop right? Or basketball sports. That's not true. No, I'm just saying that's what they would say. That's what they would say. Typically a kid if they, That's the quick way to get out. Quick way, Rob. Okay. I feel like no One ever cheat. And even that's the conditioning. That's Not even a quick way I'm that backing because, Because we condition to say that. But that's, I'm saying there are other ways for us.


They just won't tell us the fucking Ways. But I'm not saying that's, It is not saying, people would say that a lot. That is true. We don't pay attention to the other ways. Get that level of criticism as far as, well what have you done for black people in community? It's like, no, like, 'cause NBA don't have a negative stereotypical view. Shit. Why not? They have just as much shit that goes on within that space. People, I'm just saying at a certain point, I feel like hip hop always takes a hit for adding It does To be the, to save black people or community. Oh No, I was talking about the the detrimental piece to hip hop. 'cause that's, let's be clear. There is a detrimental piece. I just don't think that it's more detrimental than the positives that hip hop has awarded us. Fucking Rihanna, Kanye West. I agree. JayZ. These are people that employ thousand.


Rihanna probably has thousands of fucking employees. She ain't even fucking 45 years old. I, I agree. I do think the messaging at moments is, is damaging. You get what I'm saying? Also, think as much damaging message you have. You have positive shit out there. And even in sometimes even in the messaging, You, you, you, you still, you still, you still find a way to find a good even in that. Because sometimes even though you might talk about something negative, you're not talking to glorify it. You're talking really to just give a outlook on how things are happen before you. But hold I, I think in the community, I think because he said that we are not taught, but that's not true in school. When, you go to school, they tell you about being a doctor, a lawyer, a, a, a pilot. It is a pipe different. They they give, huh? They tell you about being a doctor as they take away the hospital from you.


It's a pipe. They tell you about being a lawyer as they take away the, the courtroom for you. I'm, I'm What do you mean take away? They, they'll they'll you Unfairly treat you in court. So now you It is It is a pipe dream to some we are In No, we as a people are influenced by people that the same color as us who are in the same environment. Making it The people that we can see. That we can see visually. Yes. Visually. Visually, definitely. But That's usually, that's usually usually it it would end up being the rappers, The hustlers and the hustle. Hustlers and the ballers. True. So When, you see that and you are living around it. That's what you want. I mean un unless you say that, unless you say that, I do agree. If you say your society has put us in that position, right, like poverty or you know, put us, you know, oppressed us.


What's the, am I saying the right word? Yes. Yeah. Like unless you say that, if you're looking from the root of it, then I would agree with that. Because if you are in a house and you have a single parent household, you have to blame the fathers. But if you have a single parent household and then moms can't give you what you want. All the kids got to fly sneakers. The first thing you gonna do is try to go outside. Outside. We're going outside. I'm going outside to go get it. Unless you saying that's systematically, it's, it's It is put together like that on purpose then. But hip Hop didn't Do that. No hip hop didn't. Do you get what I'm saying? Like, yo. But Hip hop has, has encouraged it and put a spotlight on that Has my brain. Hiphop has, And I want make it perfectly clear that we using the word or the words hip hop, I'm not certain again, that he is referring to the culture of hip hop.


Right. So you referring to rap music when he's saying hip hop, he is talking to the music, the music and entertainment business. That is controlled by Jewish people. Some of It, not even all of it. Got it. That's, see what You're saying? He's only talking to the negative shit. He ain't Talking to That's what about five elements. None. That would, it would be tough for him to have that conversation with me as somebody who hip hop saved my life. Exactly. No, listen. Like He maybe can talk like that to Mouse Jones. Nigga, You, He Can't employ a bunch of people. I would love him. Employment now helps people's kids do go to school. I would love from to have that conversation with a Chuck Dio, KRS one and Get that off fam Kanye West. 'cause now my brain is running, get the shit off Kanye West, married Kim Kardashian.


I won't say Kanye West is directly responsible for their success. He played a part in that. All of that brain. 'cause that nigga's a different type of brain. That clothing line them skims that this, that, that YouTube beneficial all of that shit could for sure. That's millions and mil fuck, millions, billions of dollars being generated as a result, direct result of hip hop. That's helping communities. You can't say Russell Simmons is on Instagram just last week saying, yo, and I'm paraphrasing. 'cause he didn't, it's not, I'm not quoting him saying basically, yo, I know how y'all feel about me, but I've been here too long and I've helped too many people. Yeah. Seen that. Like we talking about over 50 years of people helping people.


I do you one better than this. My other problem with Dr. Umar is this, he came right up here and said, part of our problem is we want to do it for us and we're not selfless enough to do it for the generations to come. He came here and said that, I remember it, it stuck out like a fucking sore thumb. I give him this music, not the music business, but music is many kids way through life. Right? Here's a tidbit that somebody gave me the other day. Tune core today, I'm freestyling, but this is somewhere in the right ballpark. Tune Core today is responsible for like something like 4.6% of music consumption across all genres.


That don't sound like nothing to much people. Many people to the people that's responsible for making this run, they're looking at that number and saying, if that number for tune core and independence and artists with new information is at 4.6% today, fuck then in 20 years, then in 30 years, then in 40 and 50 and 60 and 70 years, what is that number gonna represent? And now you have to look at a music business that you not used to looking at because we only got our eyes today. That's a whole different world. If independent musicians are responsible for 40 and 50% consumption of all music, I don't want to hear what the fuck Dr.


Umar's talking about. He's okay when it comes to that. He could not be more off base. Okay. And I, I, I agree with you. Now there's the other side of hearing you talk and me trying to think what he's going to hear in that saying, and we don't have to care, but just to give a different perspective, hip hop is the most influential culture period. Not just musically fashion stat, all that shit right In hip hop. They're gonna be a few who are gonna make it, really make it. We're not talking about That's My problem with what he said. Not a few. That's Not a few. Hold on. I'm Just giving saying the right number. Not a few. I'm saying the few is three And four. I'm not saying what It is. I'm saying what it comes across sounding like.


But he said A Few. Okay, Cool. He's wrong. He's, it's not a few. Let me, let me, let me say what I'm saying. Go ahead. Well, you wanna talk for, lemme say What I'm, I just wanna ask you what does make it, if you no It is your sentence. I want you To making it qualify, make it, making it mean longevity. Having a career that surpasses three to five years. So hold on, hold on. Create legacy. Do what? That's not the goal though. But go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go In that process, When, you look at hip hop as a culture, it's not many of us many. There are people who do own, who have ownership of the things that they give to hip hop. But for the most part you hear a lot of the stories of people either not getting what they deserve and really just play into a system that just keeps them at bay.


And in that system of hip hop, When, you start talking about the money, the real influence when it comes to power and the system, the people who are benefiting the most aren't black people. It's people who really own the industry. So if we are Trying, we not, we're not talking about hip hop no more. We talking about media business. Imani still wrong. But it's not a matter of being wrong. I'm trying to give you a different, a way of people how they could look at it as, hey, if you're pouring into a culture, That is a mega billion dollar culture, not music culture that we don't even get the community, not individuals, but the community as a whole doesn't get the most benefit from, to some people.


That could be a detriment. That could keep keeping people happy just for the moment. you know what? Cool. Yeah. About a hundred of y'all gonna go ahead and succeed, keep you satisfied. But the rest of y'all, y'all gotta don't have to be eat the bullet. There's a way where people could look at that and say, yo, it's not really helping us get over that hump as a community. Alright, Two things. I wanna reply to that. Two things I wanna reply to that. I was outside in the nineties. Me too. Not early nineties. Me too. I was outside for Illmatic and on, I saw the gradual progression from Joe Button is the only rapper or one of five rappers in Jersey City to, okay, there's 10 rappers in Jersey City to Oh Shit.


There's one rapper on each block to Oh Shit. There's 10 rappers on each block. Oh Shit It is 40 rappers on each block. Shit is getting hot out there. I challenged Dr. Omar with this, if part of his resuscitation is black-owned businesses in community. Because he came up here and was talking that shit about who owns the churches, who owns liquor stores? Who owns X, Y, and Z. Then I challenge him to see each of these individuals that he talk, that he class classifies as individualism as brands and stores and businesses and When. You look at it that way. Yeah, it looks a little different from the laundromat or the barbershop that's set up in your block in people's houses now with tech and with the other things in one building.


There are over th a thousand businesses. That is helpful. The freedom of choice today. Even for the people that signing their rights away. Freedom of choice today. Is hip hop being helpful? I just, I just don't think that he's So I. Don't think he has his pulse on culture enough to speak on some of the shit he's speaking on. And to He, but then hold on. But then that's kind of hypocritical because It is set up here that he wished that more of us own or in charge of the culture and own our stuff pertaining to hip hop culture. So, I think that's what Dr. Omar is speaking about. He's right. Just say that. But don't say, has hip hop done more harm than listen, But, but flip.


Think about this. Say that. It Didn't. It did. I can see what he's saying. More harm. Because there's a lot of people that don't own their masses and and feel like they're being mistreated and you're making other, while you still cool stagnant Flip. LL Cool J sat up here and said he had equity in Def Jam at one Point. I remember that. Yes. Right. Said he sold It. He sold it. But he said he had to fill a big void that gave him some money. LL Cool JI can't count his pockets. I would think that LL Cool J is non figures. So let's say he didn't own whatever the case may be. Let's say Ice T didn't own whatever his shit is, they still pivoted as a result of hip hop and on tour. The biggest shows in the world as a result of hip hop. Imani talked about making it.


If you are a young kid and you made a million dollars from hip hop, yeah you may not own your masters, but that million dollars you could've took and did something with it to create a lineage for you and your family. That is beneficial. That wouldn't have come from something other than hip hop. Even if ice Not Even if you don't own your masters, you still and generated enough money that You can change your fucking family's life. I'm jumping in on this also. you know, even though The white people might have made more money than you, you made 10 million, they made a hundred million off of you. That $10 million could be seven buildings. Also know what the problem is because when the term hip hop comes up, they look at it as some nigga shit.


It is versus something that they running when it comes to sports. They can look at metrics and tell you exactly how much money is coming to a city when that team hits the finals. That's true. When this team makes the playoffs, this is how much money is coming to the community and the town from hotels, from restaurants to yada yada, yada yada. If we did that very same thing with hiphop, which we won't because we look at hiphop like some nigga shit. No, they do. That's not true. I mean, they're not publishing the reports. They Not gonna tell you because They're not making it easy to Find because they paying an artist and I just saw article paid a artist off of door sales maybe. Right. But the artists don't get paid off of hotdog.


They don't get paid off of solders. They don't get paid off of this. They don't get paid off of that. Yeah. So that night at that concert, there's a number somewhere of the revenue that was generated that day. Is that, That's from you being NB. Yeah. That day. Yeah. So motherfucking when Future just left DC don don't know. And diamonds and Starlets all Of that revenue is, But you know, but you know what the, the point that could be made is went Our Spot. The point that could be made, especially within hip hop. Yeah, there's a lot of artists. There's a, a lot of people that are generating How Much money do you think New York made from hip hop? I don't wanna hear that shit. How much money do you think New York made from hiphop This shit. Billion trillions. No. Answer me before you dis me, Joe. Billions Joe. Let, let me at least say every artist, most artists aren't having that experience.


True. Most artists aren't making a million a year. I say say a year or whatever period. Most if If person why you gotta be a million. That's another hoop dream. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Another stop. 'cause we just had a whole conversation about how sad It is for most artists because they're trying to figure out ways to create new income because they can't survive just off of publishing and streaming shit. That Ain't what LL came here saying. But LL is a legacy act who can go ahead and figure that out for himself as he's done with years. But we have enough years of experience in the music business to say, Hey, everybody might not make a million dollars. That ain't the end of the day for you. No, of course. But if there's somebody out there like me that was a high school dropout that couldn't rub two rocks together and now as a grown adult, you got roof food and shelter and a car.


Yes. Because you are able to make four or five and 600 grand a year. Ain't anybody gonna tell me that's a fail Joe. No it's not. Hell no it's Not. Fail. Only hip hop. They're gonna paint that as a fail. Hell no. It's not a fail. But let's speak to how that's not common and it doesn't happen too often. I think It is for the millions of people who are inspiring to be artists who sit and watch everyone else make it. There is a realistic fact that most motherfuckers don't make it. That's true. And do not garner the success or even the lowest form of money that some people get. That's another fuck. That's another fucker I up that oven up. No It is, no, no, no, no. It is mute up for a second. That's another fucking myth that they sold us. 'cause for every artist that failed, somebody made a million Dollars.


No, not just that. Somebody made five, 500 grand nigga. They, for every nigga that failed out there, they ain't Stop I don This shit. You talking about. They ain't I been in This shit. They ain't stop selling us college. They gonna tell you they Ain't stop selling us college. Motherfuckers go to college every single day. End up making 27 grand when They come on 60 grand. You hit 20 to 30, you fail. It is over for You. Somebody hit A liquor. So now you're talking about individualism. Wait. And so Now you're back to talking about individualism. You're not talking about a group. You're talking about how one person was able to succeed off of the failure of someone else. What we talking about? A community moving together and growing and building together. Well one, that's what we talking about, Right? One I said person, but in most instances it's people.


Right. Okay. Like if we go interview two milli right now, shout out to two Milli. My man Fortnite probably made a billion off of him. Yeah. Right. Like we out here conjuring it con stirring the beef stew 2 million. Going to share some horror stories with us. Designer gonna share some horror stories with us. How many millionaires do you think designer made? Yeah, he made a lot. How Many billion dollars do you think he made? Not, not How many millionaires you think 2 million made, but not From my community. Lot, lot. I'm not talking about one person. Lemme lemme finish this point and I'm talking right to you. Lemme finish this point. My other issue is when we get to talking about music, we only start talking about artists. Joe, how many of those people that he made a millionaire, were they black and they could actually affect our community.


From my community. Exactly. Community. Stop telling me about one person affecting everyone else. Bottom line, we're talking about a man who went up there and said the black community, he's addressing solely the black community. So if two millions goes ahead and does something that garners a whole bunch of other people, millions of dollars, how many of those millions of dollars went to a Black pocket? Well that's, well that, well That is my thing that I address up here all the time. That's irrelevant though. We be kicking. That's what he's saying. Well, lemme talk, lemme talk. And, and and we toss it around. 'cause this is a good conversation. That's my other issue, right? Like many of our black people, many of our fucking black people that was around for some of This shit adopted the habits taught by the white companies.


And I'll highlight Steve Stout in that. Steve Stout early on didn't have the best fucking the they they was, they was, they was, they was talking. They figured they was talking. They was talking. We needed some of us to go learn live change and redo it. So when we be talking about music, you know, oh wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry to answer your question. There are some black people out there. It is not, It is not all black. No, It's not solely, Yeah. Black people talking shit to the white executive. It's some black people that adopted some shit and they, they came up too. But my other problem in what we talking about is when we have this conversation, we only get to talk about artists. We only get to talking about artists.


And I'm a artist or a former artist. So, I empathize with everything, everything that you're saying. But as an artist, I ran around and saw all the other positions that was making 3, 4, 5, and six and $700,000. Every time they re-upped the contract, I was sitting there because, oh, hip hop, hip hop nigga. I'm watching people take care of themselves and their families and get drivers and buy homes and do yada yada, yada. Hey, if the music shit ain't it, then maybe we need to start talking about the positions. That's it. But they exist. Okay. They do exist. That's true. So Joe, so Joe, and you're absolutely right. What I'm saying to you is in that conversation, 'cause I still, and even though everything I'm saying, I still don't agree with his sentiment.


I think the problem is that he focused so much on hip hop and didn't talk about just the whole. So if 50 years later, do we all agree that our community is in a better state 50 years later from where we were before? don don't, don don't know. That's my point. I say yes. Okay, cool. You say yes, you say yes. I say yes. I think he feels like it's not, I think he feels like poli politically in this country. Just period. The black community is still lacking behind every other community. And I'm willing to agree to that statement. At least I think he convoluted that conversation and use hip hop as a catalyst to go ahead and prove that point. Which was bad. He was saying ain't no billionaires open no schools.


So yes, he spent some time, he's had some these layers. That's his agenda. He's still wrong, but he Still wrong. 50 50 just opened up the, he's still wrong school. A bunch of, he still, I don't agree with that Jay. He has an agenda. That's what I said from the jump. The agenda is I'm the guy here who's doing this? I'm pushing Pan-Africanism. I'm sorry if I said it wrong Pan. Im pushing Africanism, I'm pushing this. I need y'all to get on board with this in order for me to get y'all on board with this. I gotta kick something down. I gotta show that something else ain't working. The only other thing that we go to when it comes to black culture, typically is hip hop. That's how I Feel. I'm gonna say this and I'm passing it to you.


Fi my final problem with Dr. Umar since the beginning of time, anybody that wanted to spread a message needed in the audience, The end. You, you right now you clown. Now you're clowning people or dismissing people or disregarding people who are, who are going on to build an audience. Nigga, I watch Godfather Harlem of them. I, I I seen motherfucking Joe Frazier, Muhammad Ali, every other nigga. Malcolm X. Oh, all of them. You gonna come to somebody? We need the combination of you plus somebody who could stand here and have an audience. And if hip hop is the conduit to that, then don don't understand what the fuck he's talking about. Yeah. We going to need that at some point. And we, I don't know why We know that.


Why we do too much. We pocket watch too much. We pocket wa like again, artists we all know aren't getting the lion's share of the money. Right. That still don't mean that they not getting enough money to take care of their families. Right. They might not make a hundred million. It could be exploiting them. I agree. It could be predatory. These people made a billion dollars off of me. I made 50 million. That was enough to modify my family for the rest of eternity. Is it fair? No. But did it take us out of where we were and create us a possibility for my children and my grandchildren and my great-Great-great-great grandchildren to change history.


Yes. Yes. you right. But you, but you speaking back to the individual part because just because you're able to do that for your family don't mean you're gonna pass that down to the community. You would just be taking solely care of your fam. you right. Listen. No, you're right. No, no, no. But guess what? We need one household at a time to create. No, For sure. For sure, for Sure. We need one household at a time. A sub development might be 20 houses. And guess what? Then we gonna build another one. And then Yo Joe again, it just got so many branches, my nigga, that hip hop is creating a ton of wealth out here. To Joe's Point, it's Executives, Ethiopia, Kaiser, fucking Sherry, all of them. Them niggas ain't old. They still young As fuck. Shit. You go under them. And all of those people that come on the, the hip hop that he's talking about laid off, those are not unemployed individuals.


Right. It's a community now. True. It's a community out there. I feel like Dr. Omar is basically talking about like, bro, the communities that he come from or we come from. Like if you look at Fifth, fifth just opened up the studio over there With Street gave a lot of people jobs, black people. That's based off of money from Hip. That's a community move tomorrow, nigga. Tomorrow this comes, well, this weekend earn your leisures putting 20,000 motherfuckers in Atlanta in a fuck that's hip hop based. That's hip hop generated Hip hop did That. Yeah. Yeah. I Agree. What are We talk about? I need to know if Dr. Omar ever sold a pack. I need to know if he ever robbed somebody. I need to know if he ever did a, b and e.


Yo, I need to know if he was a stickup kid, played knockout. Like if you did any of these things and was ever hopeless. See his background to me, When I asked him was schooling, schooling, schooling, schooling, schooling, schooling, schooling. But if you was ever on the other side of the pendulum, nigga you was happy. You was happy that another, another wave was formed. Yeah. Like it, I I I fuck with Dr. Humar at some point I'm gonna invite, invite him. Fuck with him back up here to have this debate face to I should've called him. I do too. Nah, shit. He, he gonna go crazy on the phone. I do wanna speak to him, but this he crazy. I could not, he won't, could not, could not disagree. I Love the conversation though. Yeah, indeed. Same. I love it. I thought I, it was dope enough for me to actually sit and think about, but then I remembered that I'm a part of This shit and this This shit saved my life.


Literally, Bro. I think between hip hop and sports, those two vices and vehicles are creating more opportunities than damn near anything out here, out here other than tech. It's just what the people do with the money. Yeah. And, and that's a big piece. Ll said Yo dog, if you made two, three, $4 million, bro, that's more money than most people ever made in their lifetime. Ask Colorado about the power of hiphop last year. How You use that money is something I don ask Colorado if hip hop is powerful Colorado. Because, because ofm every hip hop nigga that came out there last year and what that did. I ain't even think in America Though. you right. you know. So now when we get back to where he always speaks from, what does it change for us as a people in America and in this country?


What the, the No, no. Listen, So, I. I'm following. Okay. I'ma I'ma answer you, I'ma answer. No, no. I'm gonna answer you before you answer. See, I've been a landlord for 20 years. I, hold on, let me finish. I've been a landlord for 20 years. The choices that I made as a 20 something year old, I made them. If Joe made them, if Flip made 'em, if you made them, yo, we can't, if we, if Imani get 2 million and Ish get 2 million, it could blow his $2 million for sure. Imani can invest his $2 million and make $200 million in the next 10 years. You can't say that we both didn't have an opportunity to build up community. We just making different choices and we gotta kind of stand and live with our choices.


Everybody not see, don don't want to be personal. Dr. Omar been building a school for 15 years. He's gotten tons and tons and tons of, of donations and all that other shit. And for, for whatever reason, good or bad, the school never came to fruition. I just, I'm, I'm, I'm with everything y'all saying. I just also can see the point of Yo 50 years Later, Where do we still stand within this country as a community, as black. Whether it become financially, politics, moving ing bro and we are moving forward, we moving, if that was his point to speak to, I would've much rather him speak solely to that and not include hip hop in that.


'cause hip hop is not solely responsible for not being able to get people over a hump. If that's what his point was. I think We on don't put that, but It is all but It is the individuals though. The individuals that get the, the conversation bro. And don't decide to put it back in the hood. Yeah. It is an individual and I would've rather him get into that instead of making this solely I I get what you're saying. That's it. Yeah. But, but It is, It is something to look into of yo 50 years later, not even just 50 years later from the civil rights movement, from everything. Where do we stand today within this country? And if that's your point, do that. Let's talk about everything. He would Be wrong then. Cool. You get what I'm saying? But if that's your point, let's not isolate hip hop. 'cause now it's almost like you telling people who want to come up in hip hop, don't do it. That's like, don't do that.


Like don't go ahead and just try to diminish a a, a genre and a culture. IJI just left whatchamacallit and they got a big ass picture of Magic Johnson, Lewis Hamilton and fucking ll Cool J and them niggas in the fucking, the Monaco Yacht Club. It's it's conversations being had on them. Boats bro. Niggas is buying banks, niggas is doing shit that ain't as publicized as we might want it to be. Yeah. But and then not just that take j them niggas are sitting down with the creme de la creme. Sad part is some people don't see it as progress. And It is progress. It is progress. Sad part is it could, because everyone would look at that as individualism. That's just helping you and your people close to you. Yeah. But no, there are communities that are affected. There are h households that literally are surviving because these people are continuing to make strides.


Yeah, bro. Like that, that's something that can't be ignored. Yeah. That's my point. But amazing conversation. Amazing topic. I agree. We should have started with that. I failed you guys as a leader. It's all right. It's all good. Speaking of the last 50 years, we just gonna keep rolling. Stevie. Wanda out there to perform. They Gotta stop. Gotta Stop. You saw he kissed Jesse Jackson. I'm saying Yeah, he did. That nigga told me. That's Listen, I like, listen. I like higher grand like the next person. And it does still get it done. It does. And Stevie sound great. When can we let our people chill When somebody come take the helm?


Yo, how old is Stevie? Wonder? He up There? He gotta be seven so It might not, And let, I don't want to sound like I wasn't really, really happy that he was out singing and performing. 'cause I was like I was on my black people shit. But at the end of the song, I felt bad. 74. 74. Oh Stevie, he's He's still pretty young. He's still young. Yeah. Oh no, keep keep jamming there. Speaking of people they need to start rolling out. Yo, you white people are fucked up. Stop letting Frankie stop letting Frankie Valley go on that stage.
