I forget it. I'm showing it to ice right now. I did actually once have that in a note. What? I was at a wedding once and they brought out a, a, a disabled individual. That's not appropriate either. I don think. Okay. And like on the dance floor, Them niggas got radios. Nigga. They listening. Shut up.

Yeah, we know You down with them. Yeah, But I, I, nah, all Thank you for, for saying This out there. Yeah, yeah. Real Quick. Parks. I've lost my train of thought entirely. No, I I'm just wondering if it's Moral, if it's, if it's right, it's Wrong. It's, It is. Seems, It seems a little bit, a little seems a little foul. Yeah, I think so. I'm sorry. Flip. Don't be my niggas. You ever go dap 'em after the dance? He jumping dap You, I'm saying You right. Y'all don't have enough. Oh fuck. Discourse with the community Or enough co not to use all of the wrong words so we can have the conversation.


Right. Because It is a good conversation. But what Is the right word now? Handy Capable. That can't be the right word. Word. That can't be right. I, I, I think it, It is. That was a freestyle. Or you did it for real. That's true. I'm, I am serious. Yes. Because she'd be right about these shit. She, I was, if anybody know mad, I wish someone mental. We'd be Laughing. I was throwing she'd be dead ass track. Well, I mean, I, I believe that like, that would also be considered a handy cap of special leads. Exactly. So handy capable. So you're mentally handy capable. You're saying the person would say, it seems that's, yeah, I can't do that. It's too wordy. The term handy capable is generally considered an outdated and often offensive euphemism for disabled.


It's hard to keep. Which is also of The term should be intellectual Disability. That's What I, what I thought it Was. Okay, there we go. All right. Because I heard Katie came the eighties on different Strokes. It's hard to keep up. Okay. They develop a new term that is PC and appropriate. Every five Minutes I Vote. They say this whole pod outside of Marcus, intellectually disabled. That sound like it applied. We need a different term. Oh, I'm fuck with em. Niggas up. They caught me down the street. Intellectually disabled. That's too many syllables for you to even think you could get off in front of me. I ain't gonna hold you. Something gotta happen.


Alright. All right. I found some little take that calls people pussies and I totally agree. So I'm playing it. A take has never hit me harder. Let's see, where is this take Mel, you be in my phone. You be in my computer. You break all types of privacy rules. Okay. I'm sorry. Anyway, How it's happened, but I'll give you my take on it. Right. We've never talked about mental health more before yet. Somehow. Oh, I like it. We, we've become weaker because instead of building emotional strength, we've built a culture that rewards emotional fragility.


We've made it normal to break down over minor inconveniences. We've convinced people that if something makes them uncomfortable, it must be harmful. We've created a world where feelings aren't just acknowledged. They're treated like the absolute truth. And we know that feelings are not facts. And here's what that looks like. In real life. Discomfort is mistaken for danger. If a conversation makes you uneasy, it must be toxic. If a person challenges you, they must be unsafe. If a situation you knew Joe Biden, it must be harming you. Boundaries are also being used as walls. Instead of learning how to have difficult conversations, we shut people out completely. Instead of addressing issues, we disappear and call it self preservation.


Or I'm protecting my peace or my mental health struggle is now being labeled as crisis. As a crisis. We've also blurred the lines between real hardship and normal life challenges. And instead of navigating stress, we call everything overwhelming. Instead of working through difficulties, we assume that we're just burnt out. We protect feelings, overgrowth. And instead of asking, what is this teaching me, we ask, how do I make this stop? Instead of allowing emotions to come and go, we obsess over them like they define us. We've created a mindset where people believe that emotions should be protected instead of process. Life isn't going to tiptoe around you.


The world isn't going to adjust. It is self to your emotional knee. Oh, first verse. Word. She smoked that. What? What'd you say? Mark? Say it because we, we'll Fight about it later. Yeah, we'll fight later. You find that harmful, huh? Fuck, I felt unsafe. Mic shake. Mic Check. One, 2, 1, 2.

That nigga need to write a billboard. Let's go Ish. Nigga, you good boy. Gonna let the nigga slide get Ish. A rapper boy, extraordinary billboard. Put out a list. 75 of the greatest r and b acts in of all time. So we went through the list and now they've just put out their final 20, 26, 3 5, 25. We went. I'd like to start this topic with an apology. 'cause I watched it back. I maybe was a little hard on Aaliyah. I maybe was hard on Aaliyah. Yes. Y'all was hard on a few people. I agree. I think she should be on the list. I just think she should be a lot lower on the list. Well, was she, That's my position. She was at 40. I think That's insane.


Yeah. And, and Lee in, in the forties is insane. Well, Well ahead of Dion. Warwick and some ahead of Dionne is insane in Comparison to a lot of the people that were in the sixties and the seventies. You know, That was But like, but like, but like free said, you Know, the criteria is what's important. I don't see no criteria where she makes, where there's, where she's in the forties impact again. I don't see it. Oh nah. Her impact was definitely major. No, no, no. But I'm saying her impact isn't so high that it trumps all the other Five people below her. Yeah. She might still be ahead of a couple people that, yeah, I have to go back and look. But she, she was impactful. Like, Romeo must die. No, I'm talking about like the kinda everyday girl r and b singer vibe. That still is Here today. There was other criteria on that list though.


There was, but she had it too. Like she Had some of, I just Hadiya like I, she Had hits. I just don't think she has the album that puts her in the forties. No. Got it. Okay. I see what you're saying. The accolades. It is, It is other like, again, we go just off of that criteria. It was And rest in peace. Aliya. Huge fan. Yeah. We not gonna Do that. Yeah. Let's get to the top 10. Let's do it. No, Can I, can I remind people what? 25 down? 'cause we, we left off at 26. Left 26. All right. So you wanna do 25 down? Yeah. So basically we'll start at 25. Yeah. Yeah. We can fly through it. All right. 25 Pat LaBelle. That's fair. He beat bad at that 24 Bill Withers.


Yes. 23 Teddy Pendergrass. Imagine that's a little crazy. I thought he would've been high. This whole run I feel like is a little crazy. Oh yeah. It gets a little tricky. Well, not tricky. It is crazy as hell. I feel Like when we listen to the rest, then we'll probably, You may give this perspective. Yeah, Keep it going. I'm, I'm not gonna, all Right. 22 Luther Vandross. We got interrupt now. Right here. Them two, Teddy and Luther. Teddy and Luther Need to be way higher. Higher that high. Low 22. That's crazy. 21. Donny Hathaway. 20 Otis Redding. That's, bro, this Whole run is Tough for me. But go ahead. 19 Smokey Robinson.


18 Al Green. 17. Janet Jackson. 16. Mary j Blige. I live with that. I live with that too. Over the, some of the mother names that was in the, from 25 down. Teddy. Yeah. Luther should be hired. Teddy to me is right where he should be. And I'll tell you why. Only because of that, again, that group versus individual dynamic. If you start counting Harold Melvin in the Blue Notes, then there's no way he should be there. Yeah. And that's, And and and what you say he should be lower then. And from what we've seen in the 26 to 75, a lot of those people, they didn't exclude their group work. 'cause if they excluded some of their group work, they wouldn't even be on the list. And That's why the, the list is a little Jacky to me.


'cause It is like sometimes I agree with you. It seems like you are only there 'cause of these, these things. There's the impact that you made with these groups. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. 15 Isaac Hayes. 14 Curtis Mayfield. Okay. 13 Sam Cook. Yeah. We cook 12 Usher. Mm. Sam Cook don't go before a lot of them names from 17 to 23. I feel like I agree with that too. I feel like we could swap their 12 to 16 with 17 to 22 and nobody would blink out. Curtis Mayfield, Isaac Hayes. No disrespect. I would take Teddy P and Luther and put them and swap those numbers.


I Probably would too. I would swap those numbers without a Problem. Same. Same. Oh, Okay. Okay. So that was 1211. Ray Charles. I was thinking about his name on We on the drive home. He's another tricky one. Yeah. Because of all the crossing the genres. Well, a lot of this is tricky genre crossing to be honest with you. But we'll get to that in a minute. You can't put Ray Charles 11 and Smokey Robinson at 19. What was he 19, I think. I don't think there's that much space between them two. Unless you start talking about Smokey and The Miracles. I don't know what they're counting as individual versus, And not only that, Ray Charles, I agree with you. I put Smokey higher. Yeah. And not only that, lake Park says there's a lot of like cross genre stuff that Ray Charles is where Smokey is, is not Yeah.


Yeah. He's r and b. Right. His whole career is r and b basically. And in the 1950s when they started making race records, I mean the idea of a race record, some people call it soul. Some people call it RB. Some people call, You know what I mean? I don't know. I don't even know what r and b means anymore given all the people in this, in this pool. That's true. Yeah. You know, So sorry Ray. It felt like old school race records rules. Yeah. As far as defining the genre here, that's What it seems like. Yeah. All right. We at the top 10, number 10. Marvin Gaye. Marvin Gaye. Whoa. What's low? I expected him higher. Yeah. I thought, I thought he would've been higher. I thought Al Green would've been higher. But when you keep going, yeah.


Nine R Kelly. Nine is R Kelly. No planet is r Kelly. Respectfully higher than Marvin Gaye. Except maybe Earth No Parks. You have a fight. Huh? You, you would have a fight. Like if you, if you, if you pulled the masses, that's not as cut and dry. I think it's generational That that could be, I think it's generational. I think every list. Yeah, you always say that. Yeah. Because I I I, I would've had r Kelly like number five just off the top of my head, but without looking at the list, if I just had to pull a number. But when I see who's above him, I can't get that mad at him. I Wouldn't have had him at five. I would've had him about seven. I would've had Him kind of where he is. I would just would've had Marvin Gaye higher than r Kelly. Yeah. I had Marvin Gaye my top three. So Personally, Marvin Gaye is Marvin. At least five to me is Marvin.


Why would Marvin Gaye be above? I mean, It is an honest question. Why would Marvin Gaye be above r Kelly? He didn't touch no girls. Damn. Well. Well, other than that. Take that part of Biographies. What's going on? Nevermind. Yeah. Take it back. What's going on? That's why That's, and that's where it gets tricky, right? Because for some people, chocolate Factory was a genre field change. What I think that what's going on is a top five album period of all time Genre. I feel about that. I-A-I-T-P two, TP two, They're really good album. Really good album. They're past really good albums. What's going on? It is like Joshua Tree. It is like love Supreme Albums ever made.


Yeah. Man. All the little kids will say You about the fly Once, once you get outta There. Once you get outta there It is. I think R Kelly has a, a top five, six discography in r and BII I'm in agreement. I think he got Excluding, excluding no one. Yeah. I'm in agreement. Yeah. I, I can't, I I would never put, I would never put him the top three is still for me. Stevie. Well, I'm speeding. We'll Ahead. Okay. Number eight. Mariah Carey. I'm not putting Mariah above r Kelly. I don't care what Billboard says. I don't care what Billboard says. I'm not, I'm not mad at that. I'm not mad at agree. I love Christmas like everybody else, but I'm not Yeah. But it, it mainly, and That ain't even RB hit.


Yeah. Mainly. Exactly. Mariah, there's a lot of like pop in her discography a lot. Yeah. Like when I think of Dream Lover, just as an example, what do we, what do we classify that the best thing about Mariah is that she often remixed a lot of her, her poppy hits and made them put them pop. But then you talk about vision to love and all that other shit. And if you gonna put some of these other people that had cross genre music, you can't exclude her. Yeah. Agreed. Yeah. Agreed. So when you don't exclude her and you put her in there, if We're gonna put Michael Jackson in any of these list, you have to put you Funny about, You gotta put Mariah Carey, But Mariah above, Above r Kelly is crazy. I'm not above r Kelly. That seems crazy to me. I I'm not, I am, I'm not putting, I'm not bar Gay either.


I think they should be. I think they should close, please. He's definitely not above bar Gay. No. Y'all continue. Freeze Seven is Prince. I think that's too high. I think that's too low. But I mean, that's my bias. That's your bias. Again, some of that shit ain't RB Prince's best shit ain't RB to me. I guess that's why I'm, I think Prince's right. Should be Actually, what would you consider it? Funk. Funk. Okay. Yeah. It's a lot of funk. A lot Funk. It's not, it's almost more new wave than It is funk. Although New wave has elements of funk. A Funk. Right. So, but I wouldn't, it just wouldn't, I just wouldn't think r and b when I hear it, when I think of Prince's biggest hits. Do you think they're r Do I mean, would you consider 'em RB Hits? Not all the way, but I also, the next name on the list, I don't necessarily Yeah. Fall too a little bit.


James Brown. James Brown is number six. R and BI don't know, You're not wrong, but I hate, I just love James Brown. I love James Brown too. I'm, I'm, I'm cheating for James Brown. The way you were just saying, like for Prince, like, it just, This just brings me back to the question. I would love to ask all of them at Billboard, what is r and b? Yeah. Right. Like, I think if we got a, a definite answer from that, some of this will start making more sense. 'cause I, I don't know it, when you got James Brown hired in some of these other names, they Didn't Write on a r and B list. They didn't write ahead of the list. Like, you know, just a little blurb as to what was, what thought process went into creating this list. Not just by, They did the criteria, but not what constituted RB versus Yeah. Like we all had this conversation about, you know, what r and b actually means, you know, the definition of it.


It would be interesting. They should have done that. R and b is like middle class. It's one of the things where everybody has a different idea of what it means and everything goes in there. Facts and up. Just throwing everything in there. It would be hard though. 'cause think about this. Like, if you had a Michael Jackson album that had 12 songs, three of those songs could be r and b for sure. Six of them are pop. Right. Whatever other breakdown you have. But then the Why is pop not R-B-D-O-I I don that's what I'm saying. I don't understand. I think pop is pop stands for popular music. I think Pop is everything over. I think anything can be pop. You could have pop hip hop, you can have pop RB, you could have pop rock, you could have That's fair. But If the album sell Goes Diamond, you don't say Yo, but those four songs was only r and b. You give him the accolades from that particular project.


So you can't really divvy it up like that. I, I think when I say pop, I don't just mean in terms of the, because I agree Pop could be anything. Right. Not like us as pop at this point. Right. I mean, at that level. Yeah. Yeah. But I think when I think of a pop sound, I think about stripping away certain musical elements from it that makes it feel less strip away. Some of the soul, like, like Michael Jackson, like, like Off the Wall is a, is a r and b or Soul album. It's a disco album. Damn near. And it's a disco album. Right. For sure. When I think Off the Wall is literally a disco song. Yeah. I'm, by the time you get to disco, It is RB to me. Yeah, It Is. But by the time you get to like bad, you know, for me that doesn't feel, I don't feel soul in that hour. I don't feel soul in those records in the same way. Yeah. I feel soul, but it's, I'm over, I'm being a little, I'm overstating a little bit. But I guess my point is, it it, it feels less and less RB with each album.


You don't Feel the soul in your butt is mine. There's so many ways I can respond to that. I feel like, I feel like pop music is, is just like, it's an automatic blend of a whole bunch of things. You know what I mean? Like, how bad is, has elements of rock to, it has elements of soul to it. It has just different elements of genres to it. So that's like, I mean, pop, when I think pop, I think Taylor Swift, You know what I mean? That's what I think is a pop, a pop artist. Because what else? Batre boys. What else is she gonna be considered? She could be Considered folk or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. But not everything. Okay. So it's the top. All right, we at the top five mm. Whitney Houston. Not bad Beyonce.


Not bad. Michael Jackson. I'm mad. Keep Going. You want Aretha Franklin? That's the one we we fucked Up. And number one is Stevie One. Yeah. Fucked up. Yeah. Yeah. We forgot Aretha. Who forgot Aretha. I mean, she was, She was making our guest, None of us like mention her as being a top three choice. Yeah. There's a reason Why she Don't belong. Aretha Franklin is not the top three choice. You're outta your mind. I know, I know. That's Not, that's crazy. I know. Tell me why. Please tell me why. Because of all the names that we just read. That's why she's Not here. You can honestly swap her in r Kelly spot. No way. I'm just talking about you could put her at nine and put him nobody and put him Nobody be mad. Be if you put Aretha Franklin at nine, nobody bat to nine. No, nobody would Say nothing wrong.


Oh, I think I, I mean she's, I I would, I would, I'm mad I didn't say it back, back the other day. I mean, Aretha Franklin, to me, It is probably the greatest singer of the 20th century. And she usually gets voted as such. But if you look at her catalog, It's insane. It's insane. If you start with, I think it was 67 or 68 with the, with Columbia Records, all, all those, all those covers, all that music she did, which would fit in RB if we count the edit, James, she, she bodied all the jazz stuff. Then you get to like 19 70, 19 71 where she starts with Atlantic Records that run in Atlantic Records is one of the greatest runs we've ever seen. I mean of, of just, of top music. If That's your argument for Aretha, then there's no way that she should be above James Brown. Oh, I think she's cooking James Brown. Oh, I you got it.


Because she got more, she got more decades of it. And her stuff is squarely in the genre more to me than James Brown's and everybody Names. I took myself outta that genre bending Argument. Fair. Okay. Fair enough. Take the genre bend off argument off the table. The other thing for me is everybody we mentioned she's taking it work remade embodied it, which for me is also a sign of, I mean, you got Otis Redding boo. She takes respect and makes, makes it the song. The Otis Renick this unrecognizable. So What, so what did Whitney Houston do? She another one that can, she did It once. The top five That what she, another one that can get off the top five. You are, She need to get, you want lower. Right. I just think there's some pics where you lose a little bit of blackness. Even saying some of this shit out loud, like James Brown not being a top four act is, I don't understand that.


I'm with you. If he's there, it's like anybody putting Stevie anywhere outside of number one. I'm just not gonna understand. I, I could say Steve, Think Aretha's right under Stevie to me. Aretha's right under Stevie. If Stevie Would've been outside the top three, then It is blasphemy. Yeah. I wouldn't have argued if he was number two, I wouldn't have argued if he was number three. I think Aretha and James should be pretty close to each other. Which they are in this. Yeah. That I'm think they are. I'm not entirely mad at that, although I wouldn't have maybe had her second. Yeah. Who Putting Aretha Franklin second From 1960 to your last hit was Rose and Rose. Right. That was the last big hit. Not talking about that river in the deep shit. Yeah. I mean you're talking about, you're talking about six decades when you talking about five decades, six decades of of, of r and b music and all these number ones.


All the, I mean, she is the template. You see what? Get me about that. Like you said, even when we had the conversation previously, you forgot Aretha. Yeah. Like them ones that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. You don't forget 'em. You don't forget 'em. They don't even slip their mom. Nobody. Shit. I didn think about that. That is true. You see what I'm saying? That true them ones, that's them. Yep. Ain't no forget the block with Aretha Rose. I mean, we said Aretha in the convo. I Didn No, didn't actually none of us said That's even work then. That's even work. No, it Doesn't. That's that's proving the point. Speaks volumes that her impact wasn't to the point where it was undeniable that Aretha Franklin would be into, see how Stevie name came up. It was his name came up, Stevie, Mike James. We forgot Ray Charles.


Ray Charles didn't come to, I Don know if we said James Brown. No. Said no. We said Ray Charles S Top And he said, James, part of it's because I don't necessarily, when, when you say RB singer, where Aretha doesn't come to my mind, I think why Soul? 'cause I think of soul. It's not, it's a genre thing. And I, but this is a much broader net. I didn't think of Michael Jackson for the same reason, But the room did. Somebody did everybody in this room's name tossed around Michael Jackson's name, talked around, tossed around James Brown's name. Yeah. Beyonce, Whitney Houston. People talked around, I mean, tossed around certain names. Aretha Franklin's name never came up with. Yeah. But that says More about us, us than Aretha is what I'm saying. We fucked up. Disagree, but it also speaks to her impact and what it means to us in our age group. Yeah. But I, and I, so, And I said this might be generational, but I don't think there's an argument against Aretha being at least top three.


I don't think there's a legitimate argument for Aretha not being top three. I, I can't see it. Not with r Kelly being nine for me. I'm Sorry. I I don't think they in the same planet. What I I think they only become on the same planet when we start talking about songwriting and things like that. No, I'm talking about music And albums and Yeah. Aretha has way more albums, way more music, way more, you know, impact. I mean, She's so impactful that nobody gimme your, Gimme your top four most impactful Aretha records. Impactful. Yeah. That's a, that's respect. Of course, respect is number one impactful. Yeah. I I I wouldn't say think I would say a never loved the Man because when that came out, that B side of Never Loved the Man, and I think it was the other side.


Yes. Never Love the Man. I would, I Would put Yeah, as impactful. That that was, that was, that was one of the most impactful albums of the decade. You know what I mean? When it came, it came, it came out as a single Natural Woman is another one. Yeah, definitely. I mean, we could man in terms of impactful, then you get to the Amazing Grace album. Right. The Amazing Grace. She stopped in the middle of a, of a major soul r and b career and made a gospel album. Not the al Green shit. Like when shit is on the wrong side, you know, people make out gospel albums when shit is Going bad. They get fucked up. Shes stopped and made she On The wrong side. She, she, She made amazing. They caught me, They caught me doing this bullshit. Right. Oh Jesus. Right, right. Aretha shut everything down and made ama and made amazing grades, which up until a few years ago was the biggest and greatest gospel album ever made.


Also, the Curtis made everybody we mentioned as a star, she done did something with them and trumped it. I mean, the Curtis Mayfield album for, she made the album with Curtis Mayfield that he produced that had given him something he could feel on. There was was a major shift in, in, in Soul in the late seventies. I mean, to me, The earliest output is for You say what? You, you, you, You convincing me. He got A little, You convincing me? He has An argument. She might have one of the best voices, pure Voices, and I think she's the greatest singer of all time. That's other thing, impactful, Impactful song might is giving him something he can feel that would be another impactful time. That's I'm saying. So she got the records, the voice, the impact, longevity. Yeah. I mean she, she had more number one hits than him than he does. Yeah, of course, Of Course. That's, that's what I'm saying, Aretha is, is something else.


Aretha's on The planet. And I'm pretty sure that almost that almost every single woman on this list would put Aretha where she's at. They'd All put Aretha ahead of them. Yes. Every Single one. Every single one. Whitney would say that. Beyonce would say that. Every single one. And not in that humble shit. No. They would just be like, it's a fact. But he Was, she was impactful back in The days, man. Like, you know, It is Generational. I guess you guys are fucked. Niggas Got right, and Whitney Houston out y'all fucking minds. If Whitney Houston is breathing today, she says, I'm the best thing on this planet. She might not say it out of respect, but in her Heart of hearts, Whitney Houston was feeling like, yo fam I'm not bitch I think are So, I can't fuck with me. I think IH was something else. I I just, I, Aretha was something else, man. I ain't never seen nothing like it. I wasn't even a thought in my dad balls. I'm shutting up.


No. And he, and he's, and he's good to go. Argument, but Fam nah, He, he tees With me a little before. Not too, I'm embarrassed. I'm in Aretha stand and I'm embarrassed that I didn't, that I didn't Mark you got No, I'm an Aretha stand. Yo dog. Remember we, we had a conversation about this once ago when I was telling you to read the David's book on her. It is dope. And you appreciate her vocals even more. I key Aretha's amazing Aretha's. The shit Aretha is, she's dope. She's dope. Fire key. Clean It up nigga. They coulda put Aretha at 16 or Something, nigga. Nobody would. That's right. Put Aretha the would bat than I people above under OTI Ray.

I'm saying things I would never say in front of my parents word Unless I Was trying to get hit. I don No Pops gonna call you. Oh, he gonna call you on that? He should pop's gonna call him. Yeah. No, Aretha was never on my list of people to shit on in front of my dad. I tried to just keep that like Roberta flag. That's crazy. Who's that other he stupid. There's one more. Anyway, I Thought it was pretty brave with 'em to put r Kelly on the list as high as they put him, period or on the list period. Did they make a mention of it, of his shit? Like did it be like this? Oh yeah. Right. Read That. Because none was are apologetic about it.


Like, you know, we had to include him despite his such and such. I don Well, they didn't do with I don they didn't do it with Chris Brown. I don apologize for including I don r Kelly In any music conversation. I agree. But you know, magazines are often scary. Like they, They didn't do it with Chris Brown. I didn't apologize, but they did mention it. He was Says in 2022, Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison for sex trafficking and racketeering charges. Jesus Christ tied to decades of sexual abuse, unfortunately, which has tainted the singer's legacy. But from a purely musical perspective, there's no denying that Kelly is one of the best contemporary r and b artists to ever pick up a, They had to explain. They said If it wasn't For Dolly Parton, I don't know about putting Whitney above r Kelly. Oh shit, I ain't gonna hold you, you out Trouble. Go and Whitney don't belong over no damn r Kelly.

It was very insightful and mature. We then moved to, we then moved to this next phase where Tyler Perry responds. It wasn't the response that I had hoped for. What'd you hope For? Something more full throated. Wow. I mean, pardon? Are you talking about the one when he started doing all that Jesus across the hill. Yep. God sees my trouble coming. All of that shit.

Atlanta. Atlanta, you and Tyler Perry got a lot in common. Yeah, We both worked with a lot of gay people. All right. Giving up my religious guilt. Becoming a Buddhist.

Now at that point I think that this little Is this dude white? Yes, yes. This little white nigga is trying to line me up. This white nigga is texting me to line me up. And Tyler Perry knew it too. So he responded and said, well the only one who could have gotten that for you through sex is in prison. So just stick to the No, unless you are really into him. Freaky emoji freak.

Yeah. Like Yo, my nigga you, unless you going do it type shit. Unless you going do it. Right. Me up is Tyler. Tyler pee the, the lineup and still kept going. But man, people would give up for Oscar Letting them know y'all I'm not doing it for no bread. I pop you but I ain't paying. Yeah. Alright. So he continues to take this a little more personal. Tyler says, why did that photo make me jealous you two together? Oh shit. Sorry. Are you intellectually I up? I lost my fucking place. Even that I got it here. He's laying it out. What I'm trying to do, you can't say at this point you oblivious. Dude says, I don't know. It's just Brad. LOL Tyler says, Says LOL.


Okay. Then I say he just wanted to go for a quick walk to get his steps in. And now I'm walking to Chipotle myself. LOL Thick. Derrick get that Chipotle. Ha ha. Can you tell from that photo, Yo Stop Thick. Derrick is Crazy. Chipotle making niggas thick as crazy. Y'all niggas do be Double meat. You calling another man thick. Crazy. You getting that dumb meat. Meat. It is. Y'all are very immature. Y'all are intellectually, whatever the term was, I'm definitely, It is not crazy if you into that Ish. No, I'm saying homeboy saying he didn't get what was going on.


That's bullshit my nigga. Anything after this that transpired was consensual. You can't talk about, wait, if I talk about Chipotle didn't mean I get the hit. No, if you saying yo, you showing me a picture with another dude made me jealous. Yeah, it sounds like he's sending photos To him, bro. Agenda is clear. Like be clear. Like it ain't no hidden agenda going on. I'm trying to smash. I got mixed feelings, but Keep going. And and it sounds like from this that Derek sent him a photo of himself. Like this is an exchange. Go on. Right. It's On You Mel. No, I said how how ha how can you tell from that photo? Next one. No, I can't. Only from your jeans. Ha ha. That's how I measure too.


If I'm not filling them out, whoa. I'm not working hard enough. Right. This is cut off of mine. Lemme Just ask. So dudes claim is, he don't know that Tyler was trying to get at him. Yes. Well yes. Essentially It wasn't, it wasn't consensual. Yeah. Like Tyler basically was ambushing him and all this other shit. Yeah. Got it. So he is gonna probably argue some coerciveness here and probably like power dynamics and boom, that's the thing. Whole nine. Yeah. That's the, that's my hangup. That's my So you feel like It is Papa dynamics in into play? Well It is. It's definitely power dynamics. Absolutely. Power dynamic. If, if, if Tyler Perry isn't Tyler Perry, he's not talking to him.


Alright, Cool. But let me ask you this. I'm not saying I'm, I'm not No, No, no. That could be true. That's what I'm saying is one, were they already working together? 'cause it seems like he was just giving them scripts or throwing them ideas. I don't know if he was already working for him. No, he was doing, no, they were already working for him At that point in time. Yeah. He meets him in the crowd, picks him out in the catering, doing catering and brings him in in from that woman Ford. Were they already in talks to work Together or he gave him a job within a couple weeks? No, he got hired like right like that. He like basically picked It is like It is, It is. It is the old school shit. You see somebody, you like, nigga yo, I got something for you. I got something for you. Yeah. Gave him a job. He saw him at a catering. He was catering event for him. Right. And that's where you find The first job that a gave that he gave him. It wasn't the role that he played consistently on the oval.


It was a different production. Right. Yeah. But he got one more job. Yeah. After that. Exactly. Alright. Okay. So Now let's stop reading 'cause it's a million more texts. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. It's way too many Texts. But the important ones and the next one Tyler is saying, I feel sorry for the person that you choose. Homeboy says why? He says, what I mean by that is you're so beautiful. When you finally are able to unlock your mind, you're going to make that person crazy. That's, that, that's that, that's that game. That old school shit. I mean, But see the the flip side to that is where the power dynamic part come into play. Dude know he talking to Tyler Perry. No, I'm, I'm fully with it.


So it's like, damn, if I, if I dubbed this the wrong way, I may lose my job. That's, No, I'm not just losing my job. Like this nigga could increase. I may never work again somewhere. Got it. So that's not saying that was intention, but that's why it's tricky when you up here you can't, you can't be talking, you do. That you work with, So you don't feel like you, You leave yourself open for that. I feel like you can stand on your principle and still keep your job. Just be respectful about it. Yes. You can reject somebody respectfully. You can, you can, you can go ahead. You can be, I could see somebody being afraid of doing that. And that's why you're not supposed to do it as a boss. That's all I'm saying. I don't think, I mean when I read these exchanges, this sounds like some other shit is going on. I don't know if they have a relationship.


I don't know if they ever had sex. I don't know any of that. This is The part where I start Hating you, but No, you don't know where I'm going. I think you're gonna agree with me. I don't know their dynamic. But this does not, this feels like two friends talking. And if I had to put my money on something, my money would be on. They had a friendship, something went left and that's why this person is, and I'm Corn and I'm salty now. Yeah, yeah. And I'm about to make you pay. Yes. But, but, but, and this is the part where you're gonna hate me again, that doesn't mean that he wasn't uncomfortable at various points in the exchange. Who The employee dude. Yeah. Like I think there's a part of him that had to have these exchanges because it's Tyler Perry. That doesn't mean That I have such a problem I Hate you with, but that I Just, it's circumstantial.


I have a problem with the power dynamic argument. Circumstantially, overarching. I understand where it can be negative, but There's a conflict because people tend to like the person with power dynamics. Yeah. People are attracted to the person that has power that's in charge. Not only that, people will be gay for play. People will give up some ass to get a role. Yes. The casting couch is a thing. Like there's a thing there. So it shouldn't be yo, the person that was in power was foul 'cause he was in power and he had that looming over your head. There's another side to that coin that is not over.


You get targeted because you in power like this. You know what, I didn't. Yes, I agree with that. You know what, I didn't hear from you. Do you think that Tyler Perry fucked this dude? I I I'm 50 50 on it. I don't think so. I suspect No, but it wouldn't shock me either way. I think Tyler Perry popped Just off of what I read. I suspected Tyler Perry popped as well. And I can tell you the exact spot in these texts. No, No, no. Last week when we, he said he was, had his underwear on, he was staying in Tyler Perry's guest house. He had his underwear on. He said Tyler Perry came in the room, pulled his underwear down and started groping his ass. I have that text. But why? I have the text that kind of alludes to that. That's the one where he's Monica, if I feel comfortable enough to pull your draws down.


No, but here's my question. Why would he lie about to me, if everything he's saying is his argument that he was pressuring doing everything sex would only make his argument better. Why would he deny having sex with him with Tyler Perry? That's all I'm saying. He never said he didn't have sex with Tyler Perry. Oh, Okay. Okay. He cut, He chopped, he chopped up the, the messages. He said, yo, he pulled my pants down. He started groping me. Lemme ask you a better question. He was saying it like it wasn't welcomed. It was Why wouldn't he lead with that? To me, the the, the more shit you did with Tyler, the stronger your case is. So to me that's, to me he would lead with that. He never denies and said he didn't have sex with Tyler Perry. He didn't have to say Consensually. No. His whole argument, the argument about power dynamics is that it's never fully consensual.


So even if I say, Hey, okay, I'll have sex with you tonight. The idea is you're still my boss. I'm a, You know what I mean? I'm About to agree with Mark only in the fact that after you spoke and you know, I don't, He hates that shit. Go Ahead. Yeah. But if you're Tyler Perry, you know that people are drawn to power, money, success, fame, whatever the case may be. It is now your responsibility Yep. To not allow these people to infiltrate your empire and be able to even get at you like this. Well, If there are laws that incentivize people to infiltrate an empire, then I think that that should be acknowledged. The flip side of what you're saying, 'cause I agree with some of what you're saying is I don't know what this dude was doing before Tyler Perry met him.


Tyler Perry saw him, took an obvious liking to him, put him in position. Hmm. I think most people that are powerful do that for the person that they like. True. Yeah. So I'm not Oh, that's true. So I'm not about to hang him for getting the dude that he thought had a cute ass a job, But, and when you are away a couple billion dollars right now, you're my friend and I love you. And if you were single, When you are my friend and you love me. No, listen, don't listen. Listen to the words he said. Lemme finish. He said, if you were single Right. If you were single and you found some bad chick and you border her up here, I would encourage you not to hit it.


You have too much to lose to be hitting this girl. There's other bad chicks out here that you could deal with, that you don't work with. But Wait. 'cause what's wrong with this particular girl? Nothing. Nothing. But what could happen when she go left, she's fired. When she get mad. She's, her personality's amazing. She's beautiful. She's all of these things. She can be perfect. Me as Joe's friend is gonna say, yo dog, you bringing sand to the beach, you playing with fire? You don't, you don't. So that means You should be afraid of like any girl. No, no, no, no. Working here working. Don't I missed you? Don't it eat. So if the girl came up here, she was beautiful on the mic. The answer your question, the answer yes. I know they didn't want the answer's. Yes. He kind of right in his position. Yes. You kind of do have to be afraid of Of every girl. Every girl.


Okay. Because they potentially have an ulterior. But But It goes on With But the working is different. Yeah, you're right. That's all I'm talking about. That's it. Even outside of work, if Tyler wants to fuck dude and just fuck him and give him money, that's his business. Let Read, let me read this text. 'cause it speaks to the, the working environment shit Tyler says. And for me again, I think I can tell the exact point in this text exchange when dude got popped, I just got a lot of experience in this. But Tyler says, listen to me. If you let the cast know that you and I That sounded crazy. Yeah. You wildling. That sounds a little nuts. You know the point in that text message where dude got popped? 'cause you got a lot of experience in that. You got awo that no, not with the, not with popping dude.


He talking, y'all Sick. Please be mature. Y'all Are really sick. No, you looked over here to me nigga Tyler says, listen to me. If you let the cast know that you and I have a new friendship, then you are opening, opening yourself up to a lot of questions and foolishness. You want them to know that you are there because of your talent. And not because we have a friendship or because Tony, Tony got me to give you a job. You earned your spot just like everyone else. Don't give people an opportunity to play you small or they will. I can't teach you everything, unfortunately. There are some things you'll have to learn for yourself. 'cause when we go back to work, I'm not going to know you. I don't have any friends that work for me, my friend.


You know, professionalism is key. I hope you got it my friend. Just watch the behavior of everyone around me on set Period. All that said is when I see you on the come here acting, acting crazy. When I see you on the elevator on Monday, you not hugging me. You not ki keying with me. You not doing nothing of that. I'm gonna look at you like I don't know you. And He's agreeing. You're totally right. That makes total sense. Yeah. I will Don't wanna give anybody that opportunity because work is work. So to me that was the right after he popped. That's right After. It could be right after Love. It wasn't jumping shocking. You got that. It is right after he popped. That's right after that. Sounds like It. But Don't go make it hot. Don't go start acting crazy. This is Sunday, Sunday night. I'm gonna see you tomorrow.


You don't know me When you see me, I'm Mr. Perry. When you see me, I'm still employed. Yes. You're Mr. I'm Mr. Perry. When, And that's why this is fucked up. I don't think this is a $260 million lawsuit. I I I'm not convinced it should be a lawsuit at all. I need to know more details. Right. I'm so, I'm not saying he dude is Right. Shit. What? Why shouldn't it be a lawsuit? Because I don't know what's true or not yet. And until and and That's, but that's not the stance that y'all be taking when it's a female. It is. Right. Y'all. No, it's not. It's never the stance that y'all take when it's a woman. When it's a woman, you don't say, yo, this shouldn't be a lawsuit. Y'all immediately be like, yo, that nigga's a piece of shit, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Oh no, hold On. That's been our, that's been our track record. That that hasn't been my track record. But what I again, what I, because I said the same thing with Jay-Z.


Yeah. Muffin Church is back. Boy, you missed it last time. If you, if you Remember the muffin church is back back. We ain't playing with Martin. If you Remember with Tony's busby conversation we had, again, what we had evidence. I said, this looks fuzzy to me. And that was a woman involved to me with Tony Busby and Jay-Z. I'm talking about Right. To me, the question is always, what's the evidence? I didn't say this shouldn't be a lawsuit. I said, I don't know if it should be because I don't have enough information. But I thought you also said that we should always Believe victims. We should. We said that as well. We absolutely should. So then, but if you always believe victims initially, then you're not looking for the evidence. Listen, listen to what I'm saying. First of all, two things. Let me, let me answer two of those things. Pardon me. Sorry. First, believing victims doesn't mean that every victim's always telling the truth. It means we shouldn't start from a position of dismissiveness.


We shouldn't start from a position of saying that they're lying. That's what I've always said. I've never said believe all victims got it. Okay. All, all, all, all accusers. Because that When you don't, when you don't get sleep, we got you. Y'all really don't. But, but the second thing here is I'm not saying we shouldn't be. Listen to me, I'm not saying we shouldn't believe him. I'm saying even if everything he's saying is true, the question to me is, does that mean that he deserves $260 million? I got what you're saying. I'm not saying he's lying. I'm saying everybody up here believes what he's saying. Everybody up here believes him. There ain't question whether we believe him or not. The question is, if he I don't, I don't No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't speak for me. I do not believe how he's laying this out. But that's the point. I do not believe that. Alright. I think that Tyler Perry saw dude thought he was hot, had some flirty texts, got him a job, popped, distanced himself.


And now Tyler Perry just like straight dudes gotta deal with the girl that's spiteful and hurt because you, you went about this differently than I expected you. I wish about to cancel the show, the oval. You are unemployed. And now I what? But but again, just for facts sake too, also, he, he resigned. He quit. He quit the year, the season before. But, but your point No, but I just wanted to make make that hypothetical. Not this case. My point is, even if what you describe is true, there are people who will say That that, that you can't do that. That You can't do that. And what I, and, and that's, I know I'm, I'm on the other side of that, but I can't because society and kindness and all that shit. So I'm saying this isn't a question of believing victims or not. This is a question of, to me, this is a a Is the number too high? Is what you're Saying to me? This is a more interesting conversation than Izzy telling the truth.


And that that's all, that's the easy thing to, And I'm fight over and I'm gonna go back to what we said about Kevin Lyes. And shorty, we are in no position to put a number on somebody else's trauma. No, no, no. But I'm saying I forget the number part. I'm not even arguing that part. What I'm saying is you said the number's Too high. I I said I did, but that's not what I'm talking about. Right At this moment, I'm talking about something different. I'm saying the more interesting question to me is, if this is all true, is this something that people should be paid for, right. Given No, no. Hear what I'm asking if because you're saying no, you're saying it's not. You're saying that if, if it went the way you laid it down that they, they were cool that he, he had sex with him. He, and, and he got mad and bitter later. Does the fact that he's Tyler Perry's the boss mean just because he, That means you get paid.


Yeah, I know what the law says. I'm asking a should question. Oh, oh, a More. Oh yeah. I'm asking a should. That's what I'm saying. The more I should More question versus A legal question. Yes. That's what I'm saying. Oh, No, no. Hell no. It's a long list of people that shouldn't have got paid if we doing it that way. And that's where it gets, and that's where I get, that's why I said I'm a little conflicted. Yeah. Because there is a way, it's like if, if Barack Obama, Donald Trump called one of called one of us in this room, there's a certain kind of power and control they have just by virtue of who they are in Hollywood. That's who Tyler Perry is. And so there is a pressure that I can't imagine having To have to watch every step you make in every interaction that you have with people. That's the only thing that makes me At that level. The onus was on you now to protect yourself and protect your brand.


Yep. Right. Cool. We all, again, if we were all single men, if all of us were single men, there's a girl that we might meet and yo, yo, let's go to lunch. Y'all know me, yo, I'm gonna get that credit. Right. Like I'm, I'm gonna put you on my man. That's get you in the house. Right. I'm gonna do all of those things. Whatever the case may be. That's Tyler Perry's offering this man a job. Yeah. I think you're attractive. You catering, you could be doing much, much more. You should be in pictures. You should be doing much, much more. But in that instance, now he's made him himself vulnerable and potentially liable if some shit does go left. You a billionaire, my nigga. Go find some other cute nigga outside in Neiman Marcus.


And sometimes that's the, the, the hunt is the interesting part to people, To us nigga. No. Yeah. Make it. Nah, it's to them two. It's a good conversation. Yeah, but I'm just saying like, yo, that that It ain't too many humans. You gonna get to have the, to have the Opportunity to sue for $260 million Discipline. Yeah. To have the discipline and maturity to turn their back on just the op option. The opportunity to make 200 million, $250 million. Like who you asking people to be a lot stronger than humans are. True is It is just my point. That's just, I'm not wired that way. It's fucking Nick. It is not turning down 200 grand if an opportunity is sitting him Right, right in their face.


You talking about, I mean he was making 400 on the show. Okay. Like, God, It is, It is hard for, I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just saying it's hard for me to imagine somebody puts me on at that level, gives me a chance to create an opportunity. And I'm not saying this is what happened, but if It is, if it's what y'all described and this person has changed my life and given me a trajectory to then go and basically try to destroy their career. It is horrible. Got people fucked up. It is horrible. You got people fucked. It is hard for me to imagine. I believe I see it happen. It's just hard for me to wrap my heart around. I At this point you're seeing it happen week happen weekly. I know. And it always fucks me up. I just can't wrap my mind around it. You wouldn't do that. You wouldn't do None of us up here would do that. I would too. Yo dog. I, I still been saying for a few s like I want, I want do, I just wouldn't be able to sleep.


I'm not doing that bro. Oh no, you, I wouldn't be able to sleep. That shit is rough for my nigga putting Smut on somebody's jacket For, for The purpose for some paper, some bread If that's what happened. Okay. We're not saying that that's what this man is doing, dude. I'm saying that we ain't doing, you know, you want the fuck Tyler Perry, come on. Yo, we got okay. Maybe on podcast you can't say things. Yo niggas got double entendre in the text talking about There was a lot. Them texts are very troubling to me. I will say you don't think dude Want the fuck Tyler Perry? Yes, Absolutely. I don't know if he did. What do you mean by what you mean? Like it was attracted to him or was willing to fuck Tyler Perry willing was Attracted, was eager, was When Tyler picked, he knew what it was face lit up.


When Tyler text him the, the text scene showing his homeboy excited about Tyler Perry. The text seemed like some willing shit. You know what I mean? You, It is hard to know what want means at that. He start talking about his shit, want don't even matter. He know he, he started talking about his jeans and the size and his jeans. No, the detective, all that shit. Like my, come on man. Well, that's why I said last week at the initial, I I have to believe he went to Tyler before this went out. Yes. And, and offered a number. Yeah. And Tyler said So that Tyler wouldn't be embarrassed by this. And so this, it's an interesting choice by Tyler to not settle this because not settling it means now the whole world could, could be led to believe something about your sexuality that you've never talked about. Nigga, If a dude is bisexual and Elton John start just texting you one day, nigga you excited, you hype, you hype about that.


So Tyler Perry had a response. He did not, turns out he did not have a s the thing that been promoted as a response was not, was not his, his lawyer did respond. Then his lawyer, he said basically it was a shakedown. But it's pretty clear this looks like a shakedown. It does when you But It feel like a shakedown. Yeah. Info like you put I have a question and a statement. The TS Madison person said that they're interested or they are attracted to straight dudes. What if that's Tyler Perry's thing as well? What if his, his thing is, You know, if you say somebody's name, you don't have to say person. What You said the Tsm. I don't about none of. I repeat that.


The TS Madison said that she's attracted to straight dudes. Right. So what I'm saying is that, what if that's Tyler Perry's bag? There's A, there's a difference. TS Madison is trans Tyler Perry, the assumption from this, these texts is that he's at minimum bisexual at, I'm not talking about Tyler Perry not being you talking about the guy Flip. Flip is saying that their intent is the same. And we've heard, we've, we've heard stories where Gay men try to turn straight men. That's what I'm talking about. Got it. Okay. Un understood. That's what you're saying. Okay. Okay. Got it. Why would, why would that be different to you? If, if It is that versus it's no different. I'm just saying what if that 'cause we're saying that I, I'm, I'm kind of agreeing with the whole power dynamics now that I read it.


Right. When you say that your boss is texting you, you don't know what to say. You don't know how to say it. You don't know if you should not respond. You don't wanna lose a position. So I, I'm, I'm on the edge of that and I'm just saying that what if Tyler Perry bag is just, he don't have to be gay, but I'm gonna go at him and use my power dynamics to turn on. Just that was just was plain in my mind. And to me, gay, straight, whatever the person is, It is all the same. You know what I mean? That's a crazy, But I mean like if his fear Outta context dollars, then You can do whatever you want. You could change somebody's mind. I can tell you shit, you should do it with 25. I keep s right on these. No, He not on you. He's not lying. Go ahead. But we can't say that that a billionaire is the bad guy because you see me and switch up, you know, off your dean. Yeah.


Nigga a pound up nigga all around, nigga just walked in here. Hell yeah. I smell like a different creed that you can't purchase. I look like. So Creed type you, I don get it. C look, I'm layering. I don't get it. I'm layering skin. The layers is hidden. Different nigga. Ferrari shade, niggas layering Yo Arabian oil. Niggas, niggas fool straight from the prince. Yeah. Nigga. My thing is, well I I I I'm not rocking with that. I was gonna say this, it just, if part of what he's alluding to by airing by, by with this lawsuit is that he feared retribution, these text messages take place in 2021, which is basically around the time where he would've gotten the position of, you know, the, the role of Jacob in the oval.


The oval. It's four years later. So where is actually, where actually is the fear of retribution? If he tells you, yo, we gotta kind of like back up in front of people, keep it professional on set. You can, you maintained having the job, you maintained having the high salary. That's where the questions kind of come up. He Saw another hot ass that he gave a job to old boy got jealous. Like when nigga was walking with Brett took Chipotle. No, I, I understand that. But the point is, is that that's part of the accusation. Got It. Is I'm fearing being blackballed. I'm fearing that that yeah. If he doesn't continue to play Ball. Yeah. I, I, yeah. I'm fearing, you know, a complete and total career annihilation.


Got you. Yeah. But It is like, yeah. So now you, so now you quit. Right? So whenever he quit, what was it, 22, 23 when he quit? I think so, yeah. Cool. 24 when he quit, he quit in June 20, 24. Okay. So you just quit and now you can't get no more work. Right. And that 400,000, you flying through it Under Life be life and my nigga bills don't stop. They come every 30 days. So now I need, I need a, I need a couple, But let's represent him fairly at least. Right? Even if we, if No, no, I'm saying what I just wanna add what he said. What he said is that he's dealing with severe anxiety. That he's having severe mental health issues surrounded to what he had to go through during the time of Tyler Perry. We can agree or Disagree. That's what happens when a billionaire breaks up with you and Takes his hand over you.


I you realize that your talent, wasn't it, Your stomach start hurting, Probably was hurting. You get a headache, bro. You was making four. No, no, all jokes. Sorry. You making $400,000 a year. We don't know if this man is living check to check, you know what I'm saying? Like shit like that starts to really come into play. And so now you may be not guaranteed, but he might be looking at dire straits financially. Guess what? And does he say why he quit Gimme 5 million? No, I couldn't find that anywhere. I he, he may have said it said it, but I could not find it Anywhere. It seemed to be because of what he was having to deal with on the job. He talked about again, on the job feeling anxiety and stress and seeing mental health. So I'm just saying it's possible this is all bullshit. It's also possible that at the very least he feels like he was harmed and deserves something And he does mention therapy more, more than once in these text messages.


So if he's got some kind of, I don dunno, where he releases, you know, gives the, gives his therapist, you know, a release, you know, for his HIPAA records, whatever. Exactly. For client Client Privilege. And there's something in there that alludes to him talking about this more than once. Like I feel like, you know. Yeah, Yeah. Line them up. Listen, y'all know what time The thoughts and prayers, teas and peace thoughts and prayers to homeboy. True. All victims of sa sh And we'll wait till more information is revealed. That that's all we can really do. That's all we can do. That nigga was going to work wearing the tight mark jeans showing his body off in front of Tyler.

I think it's fly when your wife, when you and your wife do get a divorce and y'all both drop a record on the same day. I do think that that's fly. Maybe it's the artist in me. It is. It's it's fly. So which record would you guys like to hear first? Cardi B or Offset? Offset. Let's do offset. Nah, go on Cardi B. Sorry. All right, this record is called out side bx, let's go.

Hey, hey let's go. Came home. Welcome Homestar. Hey, Hey, Let's go breathe This coming on tomorrow. Tell him that she the bitch.


I'm going, Hey, hey, hey, Hey. Whole room is turned up. Oh my God. Yo. Y'all gotta stop dancing so much. Hey. Alright. The thing about pardoning with niggas that's 50 years old, yo. Sometimes when the bop come on, niggas just get all stoic and stupid in the face. You know what I mean? Niggas that don't go out unless they got a speaking engagement somewhere. Niggas that don't go out unless it's they birthday or they girl is in Europe, like y'all niggas don't really know unless laroi like y'all don't really know how to respond when the, when the box is out.


Niggas don't go outside unless it's time to shut down. Mc Trap, drive to Buffalo. See your Dad like, Well what's up? I want you lame asses. I'll be outside. Personally, no. Want a lame Ho? That is definitely, that's a bop. I liked it. It feel a little dated to me. But the sound a little bit like I didn't, I thought it was gonna be crazier than that. Maybe I need to hear the strip club or in the car or something. Mm, but it Didn't, her vocals sound a little low. Oh, we mix game. Oh shit. I'm saying like, I can't hear what she was saying, but it wasn't like, you know, she'll hit you with the punchline shit when she said the beep beep leak leak back out of, I like that song. I thought the mix was fun. I thought it was great. I, that song, I don't love the song but I, I liked it.


I didn't Love it. Yeah. What didn't you love about it? It just didn't do it like Pop liked it. S that was nice to get a couple dollars outta pop. This ain't a good hiatus for turn record for Me. That For me, that's what It is for me. If you go that long, you come back. I expected it to be something a little, I wanted heat. Yeah. I's not it ain't It is about dissing him. It ain't about, I'm making, this ain't my album cut, my first single. It's about shit first could be, but I'm shitting on this. It'll, it'll work for, it'll work for the crowd that she's trying to cater to that It is true. It'll work outside. She come from, she come from that. So she know how to make it work in the clubs and what it needs to work for and respect. I respect, I don't think this is the first single either.


So I'm grading on the curb. Yeah. But with her, normally it's not, she's not teasing shit that's dropping like that unless it's something behind it. Well the story, this don't even me doing that, the rumor anyway behind this, I don't know how true is, was she played the snippet. All the fans went crazy on some TikTok shit with the bad audio. So she dropped this record first on some warmup shit. Okay. And she's teasing a single, she performed this record and she was teasing a single, like a real single that her and Spotify only know about. What was, was she just in Ken? Oh that's different. Yeah, I think she was in Ken and that's where she performed it. She performed this in Ken because This is the first single I'm underwhelmed, but this is a song she putting out.


It is fine. Yeah. Is that how you Pronounce Ken? Yes. I've just had a argument with Mandy the other day. I say can she said it's canned Entourage About this? She sent me mad shit of people in France saying can so, alright, Mel, what's the right way? He I think it's can, It's French. That's so the S is silent. Yeah, the S is definitely solid. It's just whether it's con or can I think it's can. Yeah, I think it's can though. We don't know. Anyway. I was saying wanna sound sophisticated, I keep hearing Con when I went, I said nigga, I just came. I keep saying keep hearing and saying con. So when I hear you say that, I just say that. Yeah. I'm grading on the curve because this, this is not the big, I've been going eight years.


Single and Hold on. Wait. Y'all talking about friends? Yes. Yeah. My slow ass thought they over here joking because you asked Mel. It was a, a nickname for Canada. You know some can So I'm like, like the fuck. Are y'all talking about Bos, the Turkey? Intellectually New Jersey Public Schools. It's an S on the, in the Ken. Yo, That's not Jersey. Jersey School. Well you know how to spell it. Yes. C-A-N-N-S. Okay. Don't just be disrespected my man because He said canned was Short. No, because you said Mel, she's not French. So that's why we was like Mel, She ain't Canadian but, And actually French is our second language. That's Why I You it's a melting pot.


It's not, it's Acultural mosaic, imp petite. I forget after 13 years of, I mean you would know some of it, you know enough to know can versus kind. That's what I was saying. I don't know any French song. Any who, Anyway. Anyway, the song, listen, I don't think it's the first single. I don't necessarily Love it, but it's cool. That's how I feel. I don't think this is harder than enough. That's what I'm saying. The records that she's, again, 'cause she hasn't dropped, she hasn't dropped an album. So it's just been single, single, single and all of those. This is the worst out of every last one of them records that she's Dropped. And lyrically I this thing, I don't love this. Like I lyrically love Cardi because she's in her flow bag with I guess the bounce of this beat.


I don't all that. I'm Just small and tiny. He's little big and to and let him dunk his pussy. I can dunk the ball. It is Like girl, girl. Like I, I I can't, but I know that's how these business is out here sounding when they fucking Yeah, look At your, you out your fucking bond. She get a couple dollars out me on this. Well I mean if it come on I'll throw some money, But I have a high expectation of Cardi. Same. And I don't know if I want my leak record dropping the same day that my ex-husband is dropping an absolute flame. I was gonna Say, especially when that shit is a banger down play. That one. Oh yeah. You asked for it. Yes sir. That's why you played it second. Here you go.

I mean I ain't we got that. It just came out. I know, I know. It could be, it could be that. It could be. I don know. I remember being this excited. It's about solo record. I'm trying to think of solo joint. The offset got joint. He got joint. He do. I'm not saying he, I'm not saying I'm mad at the tape. I think it's just fast. It is fast.

I think, yo, I'm shooting at your dumb ass. I knew you had a song coming out so I'm, but well Then it didn't work.


That was the Goal didn't work. That's even worse. I like that song. The body hit. I like both of 'em. I liked, I didn't Love it. You liked it before you heard offsets. I thought It was just all right before offsets. After her offsets. It makes me like it less when you back On who, who in here could properly articulate to the, our female listeners that a woman being outside and a guy being outside is not the same. Mel. No, that's not for me to fucking have that conversation. That's for y'all to Double stand There. Is there anyone here? Well first of all, do y'all agree or disagree with that or is that like a Joe button? Hot tip? There There is. I agree with that. No niggas agree. It's, it's a stigma that comes with it that they don't understand.


They won't and they'll never get it. No, they understand it. We understand it. Some You just said you ain't gonna talk. We don't care. You guys get mad. You Guys get labeled while we get praised. Changed your mind. Right? Thank you. The ability very succinctly Said, succinctly said. Thank you you guys. What? You said y don't care. Some don't you guys more Charact. Hold on. Listen, don't I don't fucking know you guys Get Labeled. I think it's actually generational. Actually we get Praised while you guys are like, like I said, facts. Hold up let's gender war properly. Just for two seconds. Mel, do you have a take on this? I was more so asking the guys, but if you have a take I'll shut up. No. 'cause what Flip said is, Thank you Mel. No, he said very succinctly. These niggas ain't didn't, Didn't Hear where women will be.


The double standard is in play here where women will be penalized for that. Men are praised for it. Penalized in the fucking story. That's what Joe said. Joe said. Yo, since I Well men view the two things differently. If a dude is outside running through baddies, he's considered a man. That nigga, We all understand that in this room we it's understood. It Is. We on the same page like We On on the same page. I agree. Mark. Yo, you have to shut up man. Been up. Fuck. Talking about up. It is when? When they fell like We wasn't distant city Girls, but they was up or two years ago. Yes. Niggas was two years ago, nigga. Okay. They not up no more.


I don't think niggas was really distant city girls either. Okay. No, They were. Well thanks cast. Yeah. A rare moment of view. Appreciate that. It's a pimp phrase. Look At us. Look at us. All agree. We all agree. I Love It. It is a pimp, colloquialism nigga said, yo, if one key open a whole bunch of doors. It's a master key. Mm. If a lock get opened by a whole bunch of Keys, It is a shitty lock. Oh shit. You get that? He makes a noise that he spit. He's spitting man. Ab. Alright. He making up Where you get that from Ish.


What of old head pimp. And if the room agrees with the double standard, why bitches won't sit down y'all. Is there anybody that, 'cause they gotta like, they don't care because can anybody here to articulate that part? Freedom of expression? It is their body, their mind. They could do what they want. Yeah. Think people wanna resist. Resist it. They don't have to sit down. Wanna resist a double standard. I mean you shouldn't, it shouldn't be a we, we all agree there is one, but like there shouldn't be one. So there shouldn't be one right now. Why there shouldn't be one. Why shouldn't it be and what other ones shouldn't exist? If we gonna get rid of that one, we, this, let's get the other standards need to exist. You know, I, I think I have, I have two thoughts on it. The first thought is the double standard shouldn't exist. People should be able to have liberation and freedom and all of that shit. I, my, my problem is sometimes I meet women or I encounter women both in music or in real life who start to do, make choices that I don't think they even appreciate or like and and convince themselves that they're being free.


Convince themselves, you know? 'cause sometimes when you're oppressed the only vision of freedom is to be like you're oppressed. So it's like, oh I'm gonna do what these niggas is doing. They not happy doing that shit. That's, I find hey, the part that they don't understand, a lot of niggas ain happy doing that shit. So why won't they sit down Mark keep, keep it somewhere in It Is It is. Like that thing you read earlier, that shit would you rather the beginning of the show when, when a woman was talking about all this shit with feelings and all It is like a lot of that shit is true but it's just the other extreme. We went too far in one direction. So now like we gotta pull it back a little bit. Like I think women should be outside more. I think they should be able to make choices and not be hemmed up. But we also don't wanna think that just fucking your way through the summer is gonna make you happy any more than it does for dudes.


They trying to just keep up with the niggas. See? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. And we ain't happy sometimes doing high shit. We not just saying we not happy just going to Cynthia and then Martha's house hour later and then Marky who is you working and I'm married this Abigail. Right. Niggas don't get no ass. Look, look at the ass list. The ass list crew. I'm married, watch y fuck I'm married. You should be in the as I'm but the way you whatcha talking about you got in handcuffs nigga about and you nigga you can't move or burp without nigga permission. Nigga watch y'all. Fuck about when y'all talk on me talking about you in the same boat allegedly I am in the same playing my wife.

I can't remember this. He said you can go anywhere as you want. And I know right where she is and I'm where you free stop. Don't do that. Oh yeah. Yeah. She's at the refrigerator. They got Nah, It is all good.


You know what I mean? Stop playing with, I don't want no smoke. Stop fucking playing nigga. You started the shit. That's another start. But that's another freeze. Yeah. You picking choosing nigga shut. I don't pick and choose. Stop picking and choose. Fuck that nigga and fuck you now free. Fuck you talking about? I'm pick and choose because you can't keep up with that nigga. Nigga. I don Fuck that nigga. I don and choose. Fuck we own them. Pick. That's another double standard though. How come It's okay for women to track us and not for us to track them because Stalking, when we doing that, when we track Them, it's a charge restraining order. Now they telling they auntie their whole family get out the bushes. Yeah, It is like, but They get to track us. I just don't get mail. What do you Think? I ain't tracking nobody. Well the last time I tracked do you track your dudes? No, Mel don't seem like a track.

You get too cu with her niggas. I playing with her. Y'all. Yo, y'all, y'all, you did that. Y'all don't take shit serious. You talked to this nigga earlier and he ain't listen. See Yeah.

I don saying I don, there was a point in time In which there was a point in time in which I did, but I was wildly fucking immature. So Exactly. She grew up, you've Grown. I don't, I don't do that shit. Exactly. I don't have the energy to do that shit. You're gonna do whatever the fuck you wanna do and hopefully you don't wanna do dumb shit.


Yeah But June Clock track mine and she tracked me. I'm gonna fuck what y'all think. I mean if it's a mutually, if It's a mutually agreed upon Decision talking over Each Other again.

So me and my lady who loved poetry Mm. Kind of sew up the arts, went to go check it out. Joe walked in with Sade and saw how packed it was and made a beeline out the door, went around the corner to come in the back entrance and go straight to the bar to avoid all of what you assumed would happen. Which probably would've, everybody would've been like, Oh Yeah, Yeah, no, I get it.


He did the right thing. Yeah, yeah. But he did not anticipate it being as packed as it was. That place was wall two wall. Oh. Had to maybe rent some tables. Damn that. That place was jam jam packed with 95% women. So I will ask my co-host, was I the only one that didn't anticipate it looking that way or did you expect that? I knew it. It was gonna look that way. He had, well The first thing you said to me when you came over to me didn't indicate that you knew that or that you felt good about it. Stop making shit up motherfucker.

Nah, I'm just talking about with me like, like But if we Can't joke with you a certain way and we can't joke with Mel a certain Way. You can joke me way. Yeah. We Gotta change the entire fabric. No, no, no. Listen, listen, you can joke with me way, but my response sometimes it brings us into a space where we don't need to be. And I don't wanna fuck up the show. I want to keep it going and keep it rolling. So that's facts. I'm just finding a mature way to respond. There's That, there's, that's facts. That's for you. Gimme and and for me all jokes. It is pro, it's been proven that I can take a myriad of jokes. All the jokes. But every, every, every once in a while I will remind y'all who the Fuck I the fuck I am.

You said she after nigga you said she I didn say after by the ball. I know that's what you talking about. I didn't say that. I wasn't there. Didn didn't Watch your fucking mouth Nigga. Ladies and gentlemen, let's get focused. Go back to music Jim. Yeah, we gotta talk about it. Jim Jones went on Fat Joe and Jada Kisses. Oh look A topic and the topic. Yeah. Yeah. Little layered. He went on Fat Joe and Jada Kiss his podcast and had a lot to say about some dude on the internet that said Jim Jones is better than Nas and has more billboard hits than Nas.


It. It was a little bit more than that. It was, it was a young kid. I think he was, I believe he was like 23 or something. 22. 22, 23. And he was saying that for his generation, his era, they don't look at Nas and he was like, you know, our sense of fashion, all of that. Basically to sum it up, he was saying Jim Jones was more impactful to them than Nas. And then like the kids do, they start quoting, oh well look how many hits he got here versus how many hits he got here. So, and a lot of people took offense to that. I personally did not take offense just because of the kids' age of the generation. And that's kind of what Jim was speaking to. Like yo, I grew up, Jim was himself. He was saying he grew up on NAS 93.


This kid probably don't have an idea who Nas is. So he grew up on Jim and I just think these conversations keep happening where It is pitting one generation against the next generation over not appreciating each other. Well that's up. Go ahead. Let's hear it. I think it's one thing when you're having a conversation with a 23-year-old, which hey, nothing wrong with anything. A 23-year-old say they're fucking 23. I think it changes once you get in your peer group or around some elders, which is the conversation I was looking for from Fat Joe and Jada. And they tried, they tried to course correct him but he didn't want to hear that shit.


When you get around people that know you should just be aware of how you sound when you say so I think Jada tried to be as politically correct as possible. He did. He did. Jada tried to be politically correct 'cause Jim is like yo dog, it's like a sports conversation. Like the numbers are the numbers. So if you're saying that this person is amazing as an mc, but my accolades say something different. I got way more chart chart top and shit and Jada was like, yeah that's one metric. But in New York City with rappers, we don't necessarily go by that. We going by the niggas that we know get busy.


Wait, But Nas isn't just a New York City rapper. No, I'm talking about but Jada's saying to New York City rappers, when we start to evaluate and assess hip hop, yes we going by the niggas that get busy. Okay. Because that's where we come from. Yeah. Niggas that get busy clue tapes. I don't give a fuck what your bop was on a clue tape. You had to get busy or you wasn't gonna make the clue tape. It is the same way Pusha T totally disregarded anything Travis Scott has to say because you ain't a rapper. That is exactly what he said. He said yo to rappers. Yes. Travis Scott is the bigger act, more hits, more numbers more. But to the rappers, don't nobody give a fuck about what Travis Scott is talking about.


So I mean it's the same thing again, they tried to course correct him, but I think Jim was strolling. So I don't have much to say about it because I don't believe that Jim Jones believes that he's a better rapper than Nas Push Tee and Styles Pete and those are the three names that he has said he's better than in the last year. And I love Jim Jones, But I love him. I love him too. I think all his albums is fire. Yeah, I think he's a icon and terms of the fashion shit culturally, All That. Yeah. But we gotta stop the train at somewhere. Nas is a good place to stop that train. Nas is a great place to stop that train for anybody. Yeah. And I, I think Jim has nas smoke That's true for It has for a long time.


A long time for a long time. So he ain't about to sit and give Nas the, his proper credit. Also from like a rapper standpoint, I want to hear the rapper say they're better than anybody ever. That's different though. Like if you a rapper, you say I'm the greatest. I ain't gotten mad at that. When you start naming Specific people, I'm not mad at that. It, it, it, it feels weird to me. Also, he doesn't have more billboard entries than, than Nas. That's the other thing. Didn didn't check it. He he Doesn't Saw some people fact checking. He don't, He don't, he does not. And it's not particularly close. He's not, he doesn't have a bigger listening base. I I wouldn't have thought It was close, but again, I didn't check it. It's not close. And and even if you remove Features, Even if you get rid of s not close. It's not, it's just not close. I mean, you look at Spotify and not the, and these are all metrics I don't like, but Na says 9 million followers. I think J Jim has like 8 50, 800, 50,000.


I mean the, the traditional metric. You look at Grammys, you look at street, I mean I love Jim Jones, I love every album. Jim Jones, everybody just like you just said, but I don't, I don't think they're on the same planet. I I I don't think that they should be debating that. See, and that's why It is smart for Jim to insert himself in these conversations. That's what he, that's kind of what he was hinting at too. He said that his latest and he said it up here with us, his latest Instagram posts. He was saying yo going viral was part of the gig today. Yeah. So basically, and he's like, I understand today's game, so yeah, I'm gonna get up here. I'm gonna say whatever. I'm gonna go viral. Yeah. And make business off of it. It is the same shit he told us. I gotta play that game now. But We also gotta res to me, we also gotta respect the culture and respect the history.


I mean I I I don't, I don't, I don't love that move. If, if you were to say, I'm gonna go whatever, every rapper has a right to say that. But when it becomes again about an individual rapper to me who is on the Mount Rushmore, or at least in everybody's Mount Rushmore conversation, I I I don't, I just don't like it. It just doesn't sit well with me. You know what I mean? Again, 23-year-old is one thing you don't know no better. But growing grown ass men shouldn't be talking about Jim Jones and I in the same, in the same conversation. I'm not talking music with no 23-year-old. That's my kid. That's good. Or my little cousin or like somebody that you gotta have an end with me for me to sit here. I Talk music, but I don't necessarily want to hear Their thoughts.


You know, I wanna hear their thoughts on their On their shit. Their Shit. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Unless you, unless you're ahead. Like, I mean we're sitting here talking earlier about the list. The list and we're talking about people from different eras, but we listen to enough music to be able to have a conversation about Marvin Gaye or Aretha Franklin or Michael Jackson or Roberta Flex. Still not the same. It's not the the same for me. I don't even, I even if they're ahead, even if they student of the game, whatever you wanna call it, you wasn't there, It is not gonna hit you the same. You're speaking from a per from like looking just from the window looking in. You wasn't inside the house. I respect that. So I'll have conversation if you've done your homework. Your Perspective is a little skewed though for sure. Because there's certain things you just will never get. And they'll say the same to by By listening to the music.


Yes. Yeah. And it's the same thing to us. That's why it's just a, hey, respect, whatever you feel. Whatever you like over there, youngin. You got it. I'm over here with Justin. I agree. And I hate when niggas find one isolated person on the internet and make that person's thought. The voice. A broad conversation. Like, I don't know how many 23 year olds say would would agree. I just don't, I didn't poem 'em. So Gotta be careful because If you, you, if you're 23 balling came out, balling came out what? Oh six 2006. Yeah. So if you're 23 balling. Wait, 2006 was how many years ago? 19. Almost 19 years. 19 years ago. That means you were four when balling came out. But it's Still researched but it's still re No, no, I get it.


I'm just saying like I, I don't, this ain't even your era of Jim Jones ain't really yet era like that to Me. Agreed. That's all I'm saying. It ain't, yeah, Well your nas ain't your era for sure. Jim Jones. I don say that because Jim is still active out here more Na is. No, but I'm talking about more in like No you might see Jim with cash Cobain. You might see Jim with some of the acts that resonate with the That's True. Nas is going be with the Nas is with Slick Rick and G rap and the mass appeal. Nah, He's doing legend shit here. Doing some Coinbase shit and all that. Like he ring Putting At a certain dollar amount. I don't, I don't care who you think is better. That part too.


I'm sure Nas is probably not very, I don fuck about dirt at all. Just what, although his, he is a competitive dude so I think he would probably be like he's got, he still got rapper brain. Yeah. But some shit you gotta laugh at. Yeah. If you not you gotta laugh at him. Yeah. Rapper brain don't just pop out when anybody say today better than You. Right. Like some of that shit get laughed. Get laughed away. Yeah. But the masses may, like I said, he knows how to, Jim knows how to play with the, with the algorithm and the algorithm and people and the streamers. So that may make more noise than anything else. Yeah. Than him just dropping music. I just like Jim turning up on the Jada Kiss fat joke couch.


Joe And Jim consistently said, yo, my goal is a bag. Yeah. My goal is a bag so I don't give a fuck if I gotta get up here and say Yo big wasn't the best rapper. I'm, if it's gonna generate some money for me, I say it. That's his goal. He's playing that game. And that is a game that a lot of people are playing today. Most of them are younger, but he understands yo just putting out a good album ain't gonna do it for me no more. I gotta get y'all talking. And He puts out a lot of Good albums and he does What so does this. Alright, since we got Fat Joe already in the conversation, there's some news that came out since our last show. It actually came out yesterday. Fat Joe sued.


He is being sued for $20 million by Ta Dixon, a former hype man who alleges that the rapper engaged in sex acts with minors and coerced him into quote more than 4,000 sexual acts to maintain his standing. This is huge in terms of a story because it's part of a string of stories. Again, we don't know the facts of the case yet. We don't know all the details of, we're not saying who's right or who's wrong here. But we are saying that this is heavy in particular that the, the lawsuit says that Fat Joe Joseph Antonio Cartena engaged in coercive labor exploitation, financial fraud, sexual manipulation, violent intimidation and psychological coercion.


And this was filed in US district Southern court. This is basically another, it looks like a Fed thing. It's 157 page document. And just to add this last piece to it, again, his former hype man worked with him for 16 years and according to the complaint, he had an, he had a quote, unrivaled vantage point to observe the rapper's off stage lifestyle and behavior. So, And we want to, we gotta add that it should also Yeah. That this is a countersuit. Yeah. 'cause Fat Joe sued him first de For defamation of Charact defamation back in April. Yeah. Gotcha. You, so he, he says I'm a fat Joe then, then this becomes the countersuit. This is, this is interesting. He says the fat joke forced him into humiliating situations, including sex acts performed under duress and surveillance accompanied by threats of abandonment in foreign countries if he refused compliance.


And he, again, he says the number was up to 4,000. Then he adds, there's a Jane Doe involved in this and he says he personally witnessed Fat Joe engaged in sexual relations with children who were 15 and 16 years old. And he lists three Jane Doe, Jane Doe, including a 16-year-old Dominican girl in New York who quote, in exchange for cash clothing and payment of her cell phone bill would perform oral sex and other sexual acts on the rap. It is, I don't wanna go through the whole thing. Y'all can find it for itself for yourselves, but there's two other Jane Doe and it's been everything from paying for BBLs to food to all these other things. And this is allegation, And again, this Is a Rico, if I'm not mistaken, right, a civil Rico. Yes, civil. What is a civil, What is that?


Yeah, you got A, a civil rico. Well, I don't know what It is, so look it up. But my understanding is when you take the company cards and start busting shit down and using your legal businesses to pay for illegal shit. Yeah. But that would be a a not civil rico. Right? It wouldn't criminal be a criminal. Rico. Rico. This is, so he's suing him for money. Civilly a civil, you su somebody for money. A civil criminal is, we Got a jail Definition. It also says claims are, are like, there's a statute of limitations on civil Rico for four of four years. Ice. Please reuss the definition A civil RICO refers to a private lawsuit brought under the RICO Act to recover damages resulting from a pattern of racketeering activity.


Essentially it allows individuals or businesses harmed by organized criminal activity to sue those responsible for the harm seeking financial compensation. Yeah. So your organized criminal activity being blended with your legal business activities is, yeah. You've never heard Civil Rico makes sense. I don't know. It makes sense. It makes complete sense. I don't know whether this is, It makes sense to me, but I feel like you would have to prove the Rico part first. No, Well you do, but just not beyond reasonable doubt. Just by a preponderance of the evidence. So in the same way anybody That worked for you helped you in any type of way do some illegal shit then. I mean I think I learned that from the Puff case. Puff case. Yeah. But That's a, the standard non civil, The standard of proof in a criminal versus civil Rico is different.


In a criminal case, the government must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. While in a civil case, the plaintiff only needs to prove their case by a preponderance of the evidence. Yeah. What I just said. That's what I'm saying. Meaning It is more likely than not that he's liable. Yeah. And so in this case, unjust, this includes unjust enrichment, quantum merit, fraudulent concealment fraud, intentional infliction of emotional distress and money laundering. In this lawsuit, ROC Nation is also named and they claim that the company which represents Fat Joe knowingly participated in quote, concealing, transferring and manipulating Dixon's authorship rights and royalty interests and sought to intimidate, harass and obstruct the hype man's legitimate claims against Fat Joe as well as two other people. This is why it becomes a civil Rico.


They're saying that these acts actually cause him material harm and damage. That's the argument that's being made. And that, and that Fat Joe is running a, a criminal enter enterprise. And the other defendants are pistol Pete, Pete Pistol, Pete Torres and Richard Rich player Jose rere. This, I mean, this feels like he had a beef over not getting some royalties for doing ad libs, which wouldn't necessarily be guaranteed a royalty situation. Right. And they're going back and forth about it and he dropped the nuke. Yeah. That's, that's, that's what it feels like to me outside looking in Because Fat Joe in, excuse me, in the original suit, fat Joe was saying that he was trying to extort him after he refused to be demanded for ghost writing work.


I mean, excuse me, refused to be compensated Right. For ghost Writing work. And so that's when he went on radio and Fat Joe no Dixon and said things about Fat Joe specifically. He said that he enjoys high level in that he basically said, these flies 16, 16-year-old, 16-year-old girl across state lines for sex fat. Joe sued for slander. And then we saw this as the response and he told variety, which, which is my source right now. He said, this is the right way to fight Joe through the system. You can't fight him no other way. Joe thinks he's God Joe thinks he's untouchable. So again, I don't know who's right or wrong, I don't know the details, but this is, this is bigger than I think people thought initially because it's not just that he's saying Fat Joe did something when you start getting into civil Rico, the other thing that civil Rico can do is It is, we learned with Diddy and Cassie, it can spark a criminal investigation, right?


Yes. So it's so this could go, this could get huge. I didn I don't know if, I don't know if this was given what homeboy thought it was given though. Like, because you're basically admitting that you knew if this is true, that you knew that there was sexual activity happening with underage people and you stood by idly and did Absolutely not for 16 years. Right? I I think it's messy. Could you say He was afraid? Yes. Yeah, that's, he was afraid. I think that's What he's saying. If that's the case, he'd be more complicit. What do you mean mean that you, you you have a, he played a role to, to cover the abuse was away.


You didn't see any issue with it at that time. If that is the case, well, if He was afraid then, But that's what's saying is s that he was coerced Into it. You'll get immunity for your testimony And and them niggas, excuse me, they just use that as an angle. Them niggas don't be afraid. Them niggas be willing. Participants. Allegedly. Allegedly. I'm not saying him, I'm talking be sued for that. Right. Thank you very much. Allegedly. People be willing participants. And it's not until things start to come down or things start to change where they want to use these angles, which is nothing wrong with it. If he felt, I don't think in the moment Joe was aware or he made it aware that he was uncomfortable or I think that he was, if it happened, because you don't wanna assume that there, that he did have sex with underage girls.


I don't wanna put that on the table either. I'm just talking about whatever. But e even with the, even with the ghost writing even whatever at the moment, I think a lot of niggas just be there for the ride. They're there for the ride until time pass and they start to realize some shit. They don't make it be known in the beginning. Are we in a different, is this just a different era now? I mean is this going to be the norm first from now on? Yes, it's The norm going be, it's The, it's the, I mean forever I'm saying It is the Norm. No, it's the norm because you know, the US is the most litigious place in the entire fucking world and the result, and it's the result of late stage capitalism. That's just, that's just a fact. I guess that hip hop seemed insulated from some of that. How?


'cause hip hop was based on not snitching. That's what I'm saying. Oh, other street principles and now they, those are, those are gone. Gone. Those principles gone. I couldn't imagine 20 years ago. Somebody's hype man. Su, I could see Sue for royalty sue and for money. But for sure this particular angle is interesting. And again, that's not the same thing is wrong with it if, if Joe did what he's alleged to do, he should be held accountable. I'm just not, I'm just haven't seen this level of litigiousness in hip hop ever. And I didn't know if this was just part of kind of the extension of me too. The moment ever since six nine did what he did and came back and Oh that's interesting. People was receptive of it. Not well like some people, fans enough not the industry and the niggas was hopping on records with him. It sort of put that snitching shit like this for the new era to me.


Look at gunna, he was accused of snitching. He came back, had a number one. Was it album? Like nobody looks at it the way we look at it anymore. It's not looked at it the same. I'm sure that the rat shit plays a part. I think a lot of this is coming from financial literacy, poverty. Yeah. I think a lot of this shit is coming from poverty. I think that people Soul money shit, People know now. No, I've been around you for 20 years. I was your man for 20 years. Let's just say I've seen you do some shit or I've done some shit for you and now we parted ways and now I'm fucked up. I'm back living in the projects or I'm back. No disrespect to anybody in the projects, but I might not be living under the most ideal circumstances and I'm watching you still ascend financially.


So I might feel like, yo, I did mad shit for you. I'm old and the only way I can get that compensation is to, that's where no house. Because a lot of niggas might've been feeling like that before but didn't know. Didn't know, oh shit, I got I could sue you. Yeah, I'm, because this happening all across the world. Same lawyer that won that case with such and such, I'm gonna go get them. A lot Of nigga and the internet changes. Changes how the victim in these instances may feel in the nineties versus today in the nineties. You're trying to take down one of the most powerful people in the world. You gonna have, you're gonna have your a pretty hard time today. You can have a audience from day one of support and people believe in you and some action being taken. So I think there's a lot of things in the pot that's Sure.


Agreed. And there's more, even before we get litigious, I feel like the internet doesn't help because people just see you all the time. See you looking good. See you in the nice car, see you with the jewelry, all that shit. It's a constant reminder of, damn, I used to be around this and now I'm not. And mm, now it's up. You know what I'm saying? Whereas before It is outta sight outta mind. Like, nigga Move to la Pop up on a source, Nigga move la I don't even know that he existing, but now I'm watching you every single day with this chain and that chain and this watch and that watch sponsorship. They just had Joe ringside and they showed him and fifties watches when they was sitting The row that you went. Yeah, front row. They had Joe and he had the, the rainbow joint on the rainbow Rolex.


That shit 4, 4 75. Jesus. You know what I'm saying? Like, so you like, this nigga got 475,000. Oh no, gimme some of that. Right? I beat this nigga up for you. I did this for you, I did that for you. No, I'm owed some money. And people might feel like that. You know What I'm, I kind of have like a, a statement slash question. I just learned something just recently about media liability insurance and I'm wondering if it would protect you in a circumstance like what It is. I don't familiar. I'm not familiar with It. What? So media liability insurance is basically something that like a media personality, an actor, a a media personality, one of us, a journalist one of us could take out and it protects us against, you know, litigious claims, civil suits and that sort of thing.


So it's just, I didn't even know the shit fucking existed. I was like, I gotta get that. Yeah, I mean it's just something to consider and it was something that I didn't even know existed. But I just wonder now, which we don't have the answer to. Since nobody knew what that was, if this would've protected him Fat Joe in this particular situation, No, I don't think it would. I don't think it would. No, no, because This isn't a result of his broadcast. It is 20 years ago. Yeah. This is 20 years ago. Them moving around in different countries doing whatever they doing them in the studio. He said he was responsible for some of the lyrics, whatever the case may be. Mm. You know what I mean? Shit like that. It don't have nothing to do with he said he was humping underage girls. Like that's not media liability.


Yeah. Every hype man done got threatened to be left out the country though before. Yeah. Every hype man, dj, sound guy, Band members, Hey, we rolling outta here this time. I dare you to be late like you always are and we taking off and you'll be stuck over here in fucking bull nigga. Well is that, I don't think that that's necessarily a threat that's more like, you know, be punctual And, And and be, You know that according to what Mark just read. You can't tell nobody that you work with that you about to leave him to leave him in another country. Or You can't say, yo do X, y and z or I'm gonna leave You. Right? Yeah. Like hold This video camera or have sex with this person or else That's different. Yeah. That's the different, and I'm not, again, these are allegations.


We don't know what's true, What happens. Well Fat Joe's attorney responded. I didn't have that go. Yeah, attorney, his attorney responded, said, this is a money grab. Said this is bullshit. Y'all could look for it. But he said all the things that you would expect an attorney to say in response to some. It is. I got it. The lawsuit filed by Tyrone Blackburn and Terrence Dixon is a blatant act of retaliation. A desperate attempt to deflect attention from the civil suit we filed first, which exposed their coordinated scheme to extort Mr. Cartia through lies, threats and manufactured allegations. We didn't just sue a disgruntled former employee trying to revive a false claim from 15 years ago. We sued the lawyer behind it all. Tyrone Blackburn has a well-documented pattern of abusing the courts to harass defendants and generate media attention.


Two separate federal judges have condemned his conduct. One for filing headline chasing lawsuits full of salacious and baseless claims. And another for making repeated legal misstatements and personal attacks in court filings. He's now the subject of a pending referral to the Southern District's Disciplinary Committee. And it goes on to say law enforcement is aware of the extortion demand at the heart of the scheme scheme. The allegations against Mr. Cardena are complete fabrications, lies intended to damage his reputation and force the settlement through public pressure. Mr. Cardena will not be intimidated. We have taken legal action to expose this fraudulent campaign and hold everybody involved accountable. I think that's the way you fight it.


Like we, we saying, is this gonna be the thing going forward? Is these lawyers that take these type of Yeah, you gotta like how ho went after bus busby like that has to happen to now deter other lawyers from just jumping on and just throwing any lawsuit out there if it's not true. And the crazy part with that is most people don't have enough money to do that. Right. Like you talking about Jay-Z, who could go put a billboard out like, nigga, I'm coming for you. I'm, I'm not the nigga that ex extort. But everybody don't have the influence to pull the resources in which to do that. And they also, a lot of people don't want to. It's, it's a waste of time and money to not just settle and for a lot of people.


For a lot of people. Yeah. What do we think happens to, to Fat Joe from here? Anything? Does he continue to go about his dead day? I Does he get low? Nope. No, no, no. No he shouldn't. No, Because That's an indication of like Guilt. He can't get low. You definitely cannot get low. You got a new show out, you can't get low. You can get low, you can get low. You Could, but well it, it would give off a, some type, it would give off an image that it'd be bad message. Some true in here, some truth in here That You're afraid of something if You go get low. I think that's Horrible. Yeah. I think's, I think that's horrible. Yeah, me too. Yeah, man, It is just certain practices that's just real nasty. That being one of them. Like, you should be able to get low when you're going through some things for my Own mental stress and you're Under duress and you're stressed and you fucked up.


You shouldn't have to continue to show up with your best politician face and work because people think that you'll be guilty. It's some, some of this shit is stupid. That's True. Agree. Agree. I agree. But the people, the people perception is everything. Yeah. And the people are the one that, that moves. The needle Comes outside of that too. Like if, if it's a baseless claim as he is saying It is, yeah. I'm not gonna stop what I'm doing because At all, that don't mean it's not affecting you in a, in a, in a traumatizing way for where you might want to get low based to protect your own mental health. Yeah. You wanna hear that everywhere you go. Nobody wanna be faced with that shit. Every single place that they go. People point in people, you know what I'm saying? Like those are things that people have to deal with. I can see, I could see getting low in terms of like being outside, like going to dinners and stuff like that.


Although, you know, because there's so many lawsuits now and so many things happen now. I'm not sure that this will carry the same stigma that it would've two years ago or five years Ago. Tell the person that No, no, No. I'm saying Wish the person that this or ate up or they, my nigga people got parents that might, people got children, my nigga that's seeing this shit on tv. You can't say, yo, you just one of a million. Nah dog. It, it hits you, it affects you differently. You get what I'm saying? It affects your family now. That shit is in your living room now. Oh, I agree. You agree. Yo, you a hundred percent right. I'm, I'm just, I'm saying to give him some perspective, let's say it's not true, you know, to give, to give him some sort of solace is that, You know what I mean? The world doesn't, I don't think the world immediately judge pe judges people guilty in the same way they did five, 10 years ago or, You know what I mean?


Outta the world and not just That. What does yours married bro? What does the board think? That's Another important point Before it get to the world. You either got a board that's, you either work for somewhere that has a board that's gonna do due diligence, stand by, you investigate, try to flush out facts, hire a private investigator. Or You got a contract, huh? You Got A contract. But they all have these clauses And that contract might have a clause that says clause. Anything that surfaces, we can immediately, the contract discontinue our, the Contract has a million sentences that gives the company an out. If you are valuable enough, then they don't need, They don't Take that, they don't want, they don't need that. That way they go and talk to some people and see if we can fix it.


That's a fact. If we keep this guy or just try to be quiet for a little bit, so, but to, But to your point about it being in your living room stuff, these ain't just claims like, oh, he robbed somebody, he stole some money from you. You know what I'm saying? The claims in here. True. Yeah. They could cause some uncomfortable conversations. Your family, right? He's married, bro. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? You are married. Oh, it's, it's rough. You know what I mean? It's shit like that, bro. Like again, to ICE's point, this ain't yo, he, he beat me for $10 million. I'll take that before some of the other shit that he is being accused. Yo, my wife is the one I can go home and tell yo somebody's trying some bullshit to shake down, yada, yada, yada. The company, not so much. Yeah. Right. I would imagine that your family, you would have enough equity with your family of all people to be like, yeah, this is not true.


Or You don't have enough equity with your family so when your family reads it, they know it's true. Right. Or they know what's true and what's not. Like she might not have been 15, she might have been 25, but I know you fucking on the road. I'm not saying Joe, I'm just saying in general. Yeah. Because that's one of the, one of the reasons this is this works is 'cause a lot of times the person, the lawyer, the rapper, the whoever It is, the celebrity doesn't want even the shit that's not illegal. They don't want My kids to have to read this in a headline. Right. So I'm gonna settle. Right. Because a lot of times your defense is, she wasn't 16 or your defense was, it wasn't 4,000 girls. You know what I mean? Whatever the defense is might work in the court, but it don't work at home. She wasn't 16. Sounds nuts too. Right? I get it. Yeah. Kobe's defense. Yo, it was consensual.


Right. You still gotta face your wife my nigga e. Exactly. Exactly. So let, let's, there's another story that I wanted to get y'all take on. Obviously for those that don't know, the Lakers were sold A-G-G-A-G-G, The Lakers were sold a few days ago. The bus family, after having the Lakers for four and a half since 19 80, 81, whatever, sold it for $10 billion. It's the largest sale in the history of sports anywhere in the world. Any four $10 billion. Wow. That's a crazy number. Considering Jerry Bus bought this franchise for 67 million, you know?


Mm. It's a great come up. Obviously Lakers have a storied legacy. My question is, I think I know what y'all gonna say. You're gonna say Fuck that. But Jerry Bus probably would not have sold the Lakers had he been alive. Probably not. And the great Words of my man, Ian Dunlap sell grandma's house. And that's the question I was gonna ask y'all. Would y'all Feel that ain't Grandma's house? Yes It is. No it ain't. Well, Let me ask the question for the audience just to be clear. No it ain't. No it's not. Do You sell the franchise even though you know your father who made his whole life this would not have, and does the amount amount be over In his grave if you knew? Yeah. And to be clear, all of the bus siblings apparently did have a meeting about this.


There was not a unanimous decision to to sell the team. No. There was a majority decision. So somebody, somebody in the room didn't want do It, loves their father. Yeah. This work gets tough. That's why I'm asking. I think I'm not selling it. I wouldn't sell it neither. I'm not selling it. I'm not selling. They would have to buy me out. But I think what happens is, and we saw, I don't know how accurate It is because we've heard Yes, it's super accurate. Then we've heard it's not so accurate. But in the, the, the shit that we loved on HBO. Yeah. Winning time, Showtime winning time. Excuse me. Jerry Bus was a passionate guy. This was his baby.


This was his passion. He staked everything in the world on this. I went to borrow money from my ex-wife and my man Rakim and little kid. I borrow money and this is what I love. That don't necessarily mean that that love is gonna translate to your children. Right? Right. So you might might've started this thing that has a legacy that could be a hundred years down the road, but your kids might not care about it in the same manner in which you care about it and they may not wanna pay the same because I heard it's a running a business is some other shit. Right? Yeah. Your kids might not wanna put that much time and attention into something that they don't care about as much as you did you. So I see both sides of it. Yeah. Like I'm always and not for nothing.


$10 billion in other businesses. Yeah. Your lineage ain't gonna be suffering. No. Well, both sides, that's the thing. This is the one time in sports history where I think the conversation becomes warranted because of, listen, they say the Lakers were valued at 5,000,000,005 years ago. Yes. Yeah. And they double So to double in five years. Wow. Yeah. I'm selling, Fuck that. It goes back to what I asked Wale about just rappers or should we be allowed to participate in IPOs. If you're the bus family, you have arguably the greatest player to ever exist, if not one, then two in his down, you're never gonna See that.


You're not catching that lightning in the bottle again. Yeah. Yeah. We also just got Luca, I don know if you can get much higher Than that. Higher, there's not a world. There's not a world doesn't current situation. Yeah. There's not a world where you say to yourself, Hey, if we wait a little bit, we can get more. Yeah. I'm not sure if there's a better term. There is a world that that happens. Describe it for me. Because What happens in sports, especially in in major team sports, certain markets drive the entire sport. So people be saying it's some bullshit, but the Knicks got Patrick Young, you feel me? He was the number one pick. They want certain teams to be good because it drives the sport collectively.


We starting to see the shit with the two small market teams in the finals. They get reports on that. So now it would behoove the league to have the Knicks be in the finals next year to have a Chicago or la I just think that even the Luca trade in itself, if you could surround certain piece Luca with certain pieces, y'all still backing the hunt. I don't necessarily think that the team the Hunt. What I'm saying to you in this Laker case, I don't think the hunt matters. You have the second most championships ever. You have the greatest player ever about to do his retirement. Right. So long Goodbye run. You have one of the greatest players ever guaranteed Hall of Famer that just got put in your lap. Like It's like the perfect storm, Right?


They could win a champ, they could win the next two championships. It's not gonna matter to their value. The Knicks are the third or fourth with Golden State. Now the fourth most valuable franchise basketball, we haven't won since 73. But, But a lot of that comes from Madison Square Garden and the real estate that the New York City commands, it leads into that value in New York. I'm just giving you example. Well, Brian Hurst to to what you're saying said that teams financials leaked one year and because of the TV rights, it's the TV rights tv, the Knicks have TV rights, the Yankees have TV rights, the Lakers have TV rights. He was saying that because of those TV rights, local and the Lakers made in one week roughly what the Grizzlies made in the year.


Just so you have a good understanding of the disparity between a small market and not only a major market, but a major market with a tv, a local CDV. There's nothing like it. It's nothing like it. You also gotta think from the buyer's perspective, this is when you would want to buy the Lakers. 10 might be low, to your point that it might be worth more if such. And so they put a couple pieces around that's good for the buyer. True. No, I was This a bare Minimum? I got the, the LeBron Farewell tour and I got Luca here, so I know I'll be solid for a year or two at least. I Got LA Real Estate. This is LA Fam. Like I think that I was just, I was just talking to Joe's point that he doesn't see the team being worth much more in the near future.


I'm saying that I don't think that that's a guarantee. And these people at this level of business, they do their due diligence. I was own Whoa, whoa, I I'm with you. Oh, I do think that they can become even more value. Oh yeah. But if I'm the bus family Gotcha. Having that conversation like everything hit all cylinders right here. Like so let's this this is the same ownership group that has the Dodgers. Yep. Oh, magic in them, Right? Yes. Magic is a part of that. And they already own part of the Lakers too. They already own 26%. They Have a certain percentage of the Lakers already. They Own 26% already. So what what the sports knowledgeable people are saying is that if you watch what he did with the Dodgers, which was, which was was fine. Which was fine.


A way to outspend the Yankees, the Stein Bruner, the Red Sox, they spend, like, the money is coming out of a water fountain. So if you apply that to the Lakers and they kept Jeanie on to run the day to day operations. And apparently she was strapped for some cash and now she is not. They projecting the Lakers to just start bugging soon. Yeah. So it'd be interesting to see how this plays out. Congratulations to the bus family. Indeed. Tim Bill is Tim Bill. I don't care How y from a 60 I don, I would've done it. And that's one of my greatest fears working my entire life to give something to my kid and my kid getting rid of it. No, no, no. In Year one and two and the bus family keeps just over 15% ownership still.


But, But that's for a period of time and it's gonna phase out. From what I've read, it's going to, it's a period of time that they'll have the minority stake, but Tough to say no to. Yeah. It's tough to say no to that. That just tough to say no to. Oh, This, this, I'm just reading this. It says they still will retain just over 15% of the team. So if I can sell whatever my stake is Yeah. For 10 Bill and keep 15 and GE gonna keep a job. If they made five bill in the last five years, I ain't gonna hold you. I think you can make three to five Bill just off LeBron's retirement season. They gonna Make money. Yeah. They, they Gonna kill it. Money's the understatement. They Gonna make money. Boo. Cool Money.


And I think they saw a glimpse of that with Kobe. Indeed. I think they saw what that looked like. They were the only team that has a seat to see what that looks like. That Is true. Because nobody else's farewell tour even came close To work and niggas wasn't even getting a farewell tour. Yeah. Like D Wade and none of them niggas didn't. Tim Duncan and Dirk and them niggas chucked the peace sign up and went home to their wife. I remember I Was at, I was at the one when Dirk came up here to Brooklyn that Kobe was getting gifts. Yeah. And stadiums was giving this nigga cars and you know what I'm saying? They should. Yeah. It was a production show and Kobe was doing that without his kids there, without his kids on the team. Oh Yeah, yeah, yeah. And people ain't like him. Right. Like be clear, Kobe Bryant, when he was playing basketball wasn't the most well loved.


He Was a polarizing to the end. LeBron Do it, It is going, It is right. It is gonna be the entire NBA It is gonna be the A BA. It is gonna be the college player, the CBA, the TB March Mad is gonna tx a the T everybody. Or or or LeBron. Tsa. Tsa. Everybody gonna have to give it up. Yeah. You Right. You you, you're gonna have your control of all your music at some point. Right. If you don't already, I don't know your personal situation, do you give Instruction? But do I do if I don What's coming up soon? Yeah, I know, I know, I know. Pump it up in particular comes up soon. I guess my question is, do you give instructions to your kids about how you feel about them holding onto it? How to handle that asset, How to handle that? Oh no, I'm writing it in. Well, how I want it handled.


I'm writing it in. Okay. I'm skipping them. Yeah, you can do it. I'm skipping them. I'm writing it right in the shit. This cannot be sold. This cannot be y Yeah. I'm not letting myself, are you crazy? Yeah. And and that's, that's where it gets tricky from because I the same thing. Like I don't want my bookstore to ever be sold. Somebody comes and if Barnes and Noble tomorrow comes and we'll buy it for 50 million, what do you say? And, and my answer is no, but I'm also don't know what my kids going. Yeah. You know, it's like Yeah. You said what? Repeat that. Repeat that Sentence. If Barnes and Noble comes and says give 50 million for it, He would say no. I would say no. Well, I don't know what I would say. I'm not, not say that. What I'm saying is I don't know if I wanna instruct my kids. No. I don if I would Itm saying, saying there is a number that sell it for, I'm not gonna pretend I wouldn't I 50 that number.


It Might not be that much. I'm About to say, nigga 50. You got, you Got pen, you Got a pen. Nigga say, fuck Bobby and the book, I don't even know Bobby that Much. I don't even know Bobby like That talking to me harshly one time. You know? But like, but my point is whatever the family business is, I don't know if I, if I want my kids to have full discretion to be able to sell it. But you also wanna raise your kids in a way where they value that thing. You know what I mean? Like, I would hope your kids would know the value of your music catalog and wouldn't want to sell it unless they were just desperate. Like, That's why I put Michael Ball name on my Oh my street too. Now That's a little, Hey watch. It's hard for them to know the value, Don. Yeah. And I don't know if I'm even right on this. It's just, It is Their blood, sweat and struggle in that Genie did.


'cause Jeanie was a kid. Like I'm talking about him with the genie played a pivotal part in that, but from, from Teenage years. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? I don't know if, but even in that, bro, again, it may not be my passion. Right. It's unfair for me to be held to hold this thing that you love so much if I don't have the same emotional attachment to that thing. Yeah. Yeah. And Also he, I might wanna go join a Peace Corps. I might wanna move out of the country. I might wanna go live the rest of my days in fucking Paris or Portugal somewhere. You got me tied to this thing out of an emotional guilt. That's not fair. The other thing too is he was an entrepreneur. It's not like, like it'd be a different, if he was a ball player, hustle, he was a hustler. Hustler, hustle. He was, yeah. He might've loved basketball and had a big vision for the Lakers, but it was probably from a financial vision for the, a lot of that's how it feels in the, the winning time.


Shit. He was, yeah, he was trying to hustle That shit up. Hustle. Yeah. I got the opposite feel. I got the feeling that it wasn't about money for him at some point when it came to the lake, lake, the lake came his life, His religion. Because he started doing shit that was counterproductive for the look like it wasn't a good financial move to do X think he would be like, Fuck That. I think it's a long term play. Possibly. Maybe, Maybe. Like I can see if he was a basketball player and was part of the inception of the Lakers and was fucking buried Down. I mean he was Jerry West or something. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. Gotcha. That would be different. I I see Both sides. Good question for y'all. Sure. Yeah. $500,000. Write this second or flip a coin for 40 million. Flip a color.


Flip the coin. Flip the coin. Flip the coin. All y'all said I flip the Coin. That's how you notice y'all all up. I'm, I'm taking the 500. Gimme the guaranteed, I'm flipping the coin. One in the hand worth more than two in the bush. Gimme The guaranteed different hands in bushes. I understand ain't Two in the bush A hundred percent of this 50%. I'm, I'm, I ain't the luckiest no. 50% chance. That's what I'm saying. 50% chance like It is either that or nothing over here. And this is guarantee I'm gonna take the guarantee. I'm flipping a coin too, but y'all two up My no, my stance is this too up. My stance is this. I Nigga ain't even blinking. 500 grand.


$500,000 is attainable I think by everybody in this room. Yeah. $40 million for everybody in this room. Yes, it's attainable. But the probability of people reaching $40 million in this room is different. Don't make that face a half a million dollars. Everybody in this room can get a a half a million And has been able to put your hand on it at one. Now if you would raised that number to say 4 million. Yeah. Yeah. Four or five. I Wouldn't have took the flip. I've, I wouldn't took the cash at Four. Yo. Maybe two. Two or three. Yeah. I might, I might consider That's, that's, that's my understanding. 'cause I know what my information, I could take the three and turn it into 40. You know what I'm saying? Like I five Won't go back into that life. You can't take the five and turn it into three then turn that into 40.


Yeah. It'd take a long time though. Take a long time. Take a longer time to turn zero into it. That's the risk we take. I get It. How confident in you that you could turn three into 40? Oh, a hundred percent. It's not even a prob. How long Does it involve these Mexicans? Again, It's not a probability for me. Jamaica. Oh, these, the Jamaicans. Okay. It ain't a probability. Does Winston get involved? It's a hundred percent probability. How long? Depending how many balloons they can swallow. How deep? He said How deep mark Yo Nah, how long would it take me to turn three into 40? I don't know about that.


But it's a guarantee that it would turn into 40. Like it's not even a question in my brain. Three Years. Nah, nah, I didn It is gonna take more maybe five, five years. Maybe not five. About five. I mean there, there's In five years. In five years, if you don't have the 40 and you don't have the three, what could somebody do to you? Nothing. 'cause I'm gonna have one of the two. But if you don't, three Gonna turn that out. Six or seven. It ain't going three to Zero. 1 1, 1 of them at The very least three can give you financial. If you put, if you just lived your regulat life and put three in an interest bearing account, I mean you'd be fine At 4%. Yeah. Treasury bonds, you would still make money off the, the That's what I'm saying. It, it, it creates too much security for somebody to not do it.


Now if you up up then you, you would feel the way about the 3 million that we feeling about this 500, like, you know, I could put my hands, I could get 500 Yeah. Tomorrow, You know what I mean? Doing something. But it's hard for me to get my hands on two or 3 million just by one act. True. Got it. Got it. So for your instance, right, It would Be like what, 40 if they said 2 million or you gonna flip the 500 million? No, no, no. I'm flipping the coin Regardless. Yeah. Yeah. Because the zero is valuable to me, the zero is the most valuable part in that equation. I don't have none of it. No, I ain't, you're in a different place. So I flip the coin too. If I have, if I have zero, I ain't gonna lose a wink of sleep not getting some shit that was there if it was three. So roll ice, If it was, what if it was 3 million?


I'm flipping the coin. Not Me. No, but Joe, if they said 40 million guaranteed or 500 million in the flip, you not taking, I flipping the coin. You're not taking 40 million. Guaranteed. I'm flipping that coin. Okay. I'm flipping that million money. I forgot I was talking A lot of money. 40 million Like a billionaire. Frankie Beverly, 40 million is a lot of money. 5 million. 500 million. Just a chance of It is is enough. 60 and 500 rest In peace. Bailey, man, I feel like Bailey on, on Lotto day going in the same store for 60 years and I hit one day, nigga 500 million. I gotta flip the coin. I have to, it's like on the game shows when they be like, all right, you can walk away now with what's behind door number one.


Oh, you're stupid ass could try pick somebody know shit, press your luck. Yeah. I'm always gonna be that idiot. Nah, It depends. Nah, that's not true. That whammy come out and start doing a Michael Jackson. It's like deal. No. How that game, Mel, press your luck. They be like, big buddy, big money, big wham, big no whammy. You, You change that to a hundred mil. I'm, I take it, Okay, If you change the wine meal, I'll take it. Of course. That makes sense. Then I'm not gonna play it for Of course You right. You know why, you know why? Because the other money that is accessible, I'm not saying him, but I know I get two mil or three mil. I could work to get that. So I I'm not mind, I don't mind even 10. I don't mind to take the chance of flipping the coin. But You don't think that with that mindset, you, you know for a fact you could get the three mil, right?


I can in my mind, yeah. And Once you hit the three mil, it's going to change and then you gonna be like, yo, shit, I got three. I know I could get seven. I know I could get 10.

I don I Used to think It, is it like a hoop in the, I used, I used to think it was gay before, but It is not like I seen some niggas rock it. Pause after the cult. I feel I have mixed feelings about it, but because It was, wait, what is the, what did a nose ring have to do with the cult? It was a requirement. At what Point you had a nose ring?


Are You fucking serious? Which one Did you have? Didn didn't have one. I, I came in right after the nose ring era. I Still won't send the link though. Word. Now we know why he in there with a nose ring. I ain't that's the, he that's The least to what? He in there with a nose ring. Saw up his nose. When Did the nose rings symbolize in the cult? Well, because there was a, the short answer is there was a, there was an era where our dress and our clothes when they were the an stars in Brooklyn was Sudanese. And so we had to wear like white jia, like white outfits, nose ring things around her head and o ball this stuff. So it was, it was just, it was just the style.


Was it? We all did it. He didn't tell us to do it. But you kind of did. If he did it, you did it. I had, when I came in, we had them little, we had, we had them little rat tails in the back. What up though? So I, I used to have to Yeah. Was a particular, like, it had to be a hoop, a stud. Like, like did it Matter? It was a small hoop In the middle or on The side. On the side. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That Niggas was wilding over there. Clan. They gonna find a picture of You. I mean, they connected. It is all connected. They Gonna find a picture of you with the, with the hoop.

We don't talk, we don't talk about contracts anymore. Anymore. Just, Okay, so why July 1st? We don't talk about, and we already, well you, we already finished the, we just re-upped for five years, so yeah, so We good. Okay. Plenty of out in there though. Yeah. Five year deal. JB and Options. MLH Options. Equity. Equity shares. Yeah. Shares. It is dope. I I was actually, they were very, they were very fair. Yeah. Got it. Well, Mel, as a woman, what is, what is your It is, I would say instant turnoff.


I'm sorry. Yeah. Okay. Nobody gave their opinion though. Don't let Kravitz having those words. Oh Yeah. He can kind of get away With it. Pac didn't, PAC didn't do it for you? No. Strangely enough. You wanted, he did such a good job as Bishop in Juice that I hated him for such a long time. But you gotta understand, I was introduced to Tupac when I was like 13, 14 years old. So that's the first impression that I had of him. So it took me a really long time to actually like him. Gotcha. Because of that role. So, gotcha. Yeah. So no answer is, it did not do anything for me because he, But the Lenny nose ring was cool, right?


Like that's a beautiful one. I mean he's a, he's a rockstar, so, you know, a lot of the things that he does, he's just, he can, he can get away with that. Okay, Well we go It's true. Stick around at the Lenny. How long he would stay after at the Lenny meeting greet. Anyway, listen, this is what I got for y'all. Maybe a stupid question, but I just wanna revisit that top 75 list really quick, okay? Okay. With Aaliyah as the bar here, I just wanna throw some names at y'all. Aaliyah has a better discography than the dream. Much more impactful. I'm gonna ask about Impact.


Yes. I would say yes. I'm asking about records. I love Dream, but yeah. Yes. Okay. Yeah. Better discography than Tyrese. Yes, yes, yes. I don't think so. Yes. Better discography than Trey songs. No, I knew Trey was gonna come up. No, no, that's A better argument. That's the best one. So for Me, yeah. But yes, but I, I could see why, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't die on that hill. No. But I would say yes. No, I think y'all forgetting some of Aaliyah's stuff and remember, and also I think Y'all forgetting some Tre songs, records Ain't Records ain't the only criteria. It was, It Wasn't. I'm I'm, I'm only asking about the he I don't wanna give them to, To a to a r and b. Purist Tyree. No. But for all of, I see why she would make the list over Tyrese.


Trey songs is a different argument. She don't have a better discography than Trey songs. She does not. Not to me either. She does not. I'm not confront, she doesn't like I think I could take a better Album than Trey songs. I could take away of Trey songs album. And he still might have the better discography than her. True. She don't, that's no shots to her. But I mean, no disrespect to her at all. That Ready is different. Not just Ready five. It is up. You got some shit. All right. He has some shit. Yeah. Alright, so I won't bother with T-Pain. I would agree. Any other, you got some shit I'm Thinking about. Alright, I don't have anything else that I'm dying to get out.


I'm kind of Chilling. How about y'all? Anything? I'm Straight. I'm good. Anything? Chilling. Chilling. I know there's normally a rush to the topic board in the, so Mel, what's the Last thing? I can't read it from here. Trump criticized this non-working holidays. He tweet Donald Trump tweeted it on Juneteenth that we gotta, I'm tired of these non-working holidays is killing the economy. So it felt like a shot against Juneteenth. Oh he's not ki but he's not doing anything to kill the economy. Okay, got it. That's Why, you know. Yeah. Or he not saying nothing against the other non-work holidays. Right. He didn't tweet that on Columbus day. He ain't tweet that on, you know. Yeah. They went and pulled up his other statements on Juneteenth like when he was president.


Right. What'd he say? Oh I love black people and you know, all of that. All of that Billboard just released a statement about Arc. Well, not a statement, there's a headline.
