Let me get some, let me get some tickets. Yes. According to my girl, that's not the first time that I've had a Kendrick in Jersey concert conversation. 'cause according to her, when he was in Jersey and, and she is a liar too, but Jesus, according to her, when, when he was in Houston and she was about to go, I said, don't go wait until he comes to Jersey.


We'll just go in Jersey. I believe her. Ah. So, so She can't hold that. I, that was years Ago. She's a huge Oh, this tour, This one. I went Houston like two weeks ago. Like god damn. Not too long. Monday? Yeah. Not too long ago. Oh Joe, come on. Shit. I don't, I don't remember any of that happening. It's still Early. She could get here. So as I'm on the FaceTime walking Right.

If she walks in and scare the shit out of me again. That all your ass boy, if she coming in, let her come in. Boy. Tell her come on. Come through. Tell her, text her. So is your, I'm not sure it depending on whether she can make it in or not. Yes. It's a serious question. No, It is. You know, the weather would be delaying. Oh yeah. I'm not sure because of the weather mark and the traffic. Right, right. You don't Dr.


You a driver. A driver. And don't do that trick about having her fly north. Nigga don't Newark, don't do that trick. Fly that trick. Heard fly our LGA a boy. Yeah, exactly. Don't leave with an air airport on the runway for hours and the show is done. Come on With You Scott. Even though she did say that, she would feel better if I didn't go. Oh, y'all had this conversation All week. Once he found out he was, this Is the only conversation they've had all week. I'm, I'm assuming, Yo Joe, you crazy boy. You better go. This is at least three days strong. Okay. Do you have a cleanup plan?


Because I, you be ahead of The Game Is the cleanup plan, just in case you go, what's the cleanup? Can you Pre-record a FaceTime so that she thinks you're home and we'll lie. And if this is a safe space, which it isn't. No, never. Never. But I built my entire empire on just saying the wrong thing on air. Sure. So I'm gonna do it. Do it. I didn't plan on going all out for Mother's Day either. Ah, that was gonna be my next question. Yeah. Can you make up, Well, there you go. Yeah. That's your way For nobody. Yeah. Like I'm kind of beefing with my mom a little bit over it too.


Oh Shit. He, he kind of did say that. He definitely said that. What does your mom want? The world let not pay and deserves it. Lemme not pay her like that. Every mother's day. We typically don't go out to the restaurants because of humans and traffic. It's ridiculous. So we normally celebrate like after Mother's Day or before Mother's Day. Don't you do the Whole cooking this year? My mom says, yo, what are we gonna do for Mother's Day? Just me and her when I went to go see her. What are we gonna do for Mother's Day? Oh, maybe you, y'all, you and your brother can just come over here. I said Ma, that's perfect. And that was it. Mm.


I took that to mean she would be cooking. Hey Joe, your favorite meal. Maybe something nice. You deserve it, Joe. On Mother's Day. It is. It's your day. Mothers. Thank you for being my child. So she says she's not cooking on Mother's Day. True. Yeah. And I said, well who did you think was cooking one of your in your house on Mother's Day? And she said, I don't know, it shouldn't be her but I'm not cooking. Shouldn't be her. I said, would you like me to get food catered to your house on Mother's Day? And she said, yeah, well I don't know, but I know I ain't cooking. I'm not cooking.


That would be the plan. That seems reasonable. And she wants you to be the decider so she's in to make any decisions. Yeah. Ain't gotta do shit on Mother's Day or if there's like a, I'm the one that's going to hear it. My brother's gonna get some type of pass. 'cause he don't ever give a fuck. Right. Just get a chef. Have somebody come get a chef. Even though he did just text me and say, Hey, what we doing for mommy? There you go. Which means what are you doing? I'm, I'm taking them right over here to o You right to life after. Oh, ain't get dressed. Wow. What you gonna like it? No, no, no. I don't like it. I think it'd be nice and fancy if you had a chef come to the house and make and make meal. Make your mom's favorite stuff. Maybe she don't want the chef in her house though. She said she's okay with Dec Catering, so. Oh, okay. She didn't say that. She just said she don't wanna cook, but Well she's not cooking if you do that.


So even if she does have some pushback. Exactly. Well you said you're not cooking so I took care of that. So you don't have to cook. I really didn't want to have this talk with y'all. I wanted to talk to some Yes men about it. Why don't you host so that it takes the bite off her. Also, mother's Day is my son's birthday. Oh, double header. Okay. Double header. Nice. Oh that's tough. Yeah. So include him in the festivities. Yeah. And then my girl ends the next day with whatever attitude she wants to have about the concert. So we'll see.

It does feel good to go into the weekend not having to say words like split That feel while that feels awesome.


It's not what we are here for. Right this second. A little later on, I'll say what needs to be said. Oh, okay. He making a stew. Yeah. That's the worst part. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's fucked up. Sorry buddy. So, So are we gonna do this? Mark? Alright, so listen, the other day, the other day when the Smokey Robinson News broke, we were dead in the middle of a Patreon episode. Mark stopped us and said Breaking news. Breaking news. Breaking news. Yeah. And the way he did it, first of all, we thought Smokey Robinson had died. I was gonna say the way he said it was, he was like, breaking, breaking news happen right now. Now. Oh my God. We have to. He said breaking, breaking news news, Breaking news. I'm so smokey Robinson.


Yeah. And we're like, whoa, don't play like that. Stop. Yeah. And stop. But then he read out what was happening with Smokey Robinson, but he did it in such a nice clean, professional CNN kinda way that Also extraordinarily graphic. Yeah. It was like the books that my girl reads. But like the bad version. Yes. Very detailed, very descriptive. And it did suck a little bit of the air outta the room, hearing such horrific details attached to one of our black legends and one of the all time greats in music. Yeah. But then I got home and just got to thinking Now, you know what?


I toss it to my distinguished panel. Wait, look. Just so people know Smokey, who's been on tour, his victory tour For 70, 80 years. A couple different kinds of tours. But this Right. And we probably shouldn't call it a victory tour anymore. Yeah, no, no. But that's the problem though, right? Because he said, they said this was his victory lap. This was his last kind of big tour. And he was coming off that amazing album called Gams. Gams. Gams, yeah. And then he got hit with these sexual assault allegations, sexual violence allegations from four people, all Jane Doe who worked with him and lived with him. I'll just leave it there. And so the housekeepers the housekeepers, and they say that it happened not just once or twice, once it happened over like 16 years.


Others that it happened over a year. So it's an extended thing. And it just, it raised a lot of questions and a lot of concerns about somebody we that weren't necessarily thinking that about. Or am I, am I naive about Smokey? You are naive about a few things. Smokey being one of them. Smokey is one of them. I just believed in Smokey. Sure. Yeah. But have you like, but why looked smokey? You know why? 'cause I feel like if by 85, like Barry Gordy, we heard about this shit a long time ago. James Brown. We always heard about this. There's people you hear shit about. I never heard nothing even on the streets about smoke. Marvin Gaye. I heard stuff, but Smokey I ain't heard nothing about. So I thought Smokey was ran a tight ship.


No, clearly. I just, I didn't know. So I was a little, I was a little, I was swab the deck. Oh shit. When I thought about it more like he from Detroit, he light skinned, he got light eyes. He's a singer. I mean all, all, all the signs. All the signs Of being, he just brought out the Horst album in the history of album. I I read these titles again. The song Start with, start with the last one. No, I'm gonna go in order. 'cause he finishes with that, which is Whoa, whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa, whoa. Yeah. Don't, don't tell us how he finishes again on the draft Track one sms. You good?


Track two. How you make me feel. All right. Not, not too bad. Not too bad. Warming up. I wanna know your body all. Yeah, that's, that's starting to, I keep calling you. Oh, stalk initially stalking. Sexually stalkerish come by two R Kelly joints. S good. Yeah. Roll around. Oh no. Okay. Okay. Okay. Now we making it so I can put the towel down. Go ahead. Beside you. Oh, you wanna be nice now the spoon. Now's the spoon. That's the early morning one. Yeah. If we don't have each other, okay. It is safe. You gotta throw something in there that's like, you know, tepid.


You feel me up. That's a threat man. If we don't have each other, then what's gonna happen? What's gonna happen? Smoke if I leave my house will be dirty and you won't What was that one? You fill me up. Oh, you some kinky shit. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's, I think it was more like you fill me up. Yeah. Oh yeah. The comma. Yeah. Yeah. Semicolon. It is fine though. I fit in there. That's how, that's how he wrapped up the album. That's, that's how he pause concluded the album. I fit in there. I fit in there. Okay, so I'll go first on this. Please fill you up. Everything that they're saying about Smokey Robinson, I believe, I think he did everything that they say and some things that they haven't said yet, they should probably conduct an even deeper investigation into his belongings and searches and entire house to uncover more evidence from cold cases or unsolved crimes.


Smokey Robinson, you could look in his eyes and just see He didn't mean nobody no good. It's like at the end of Thriller when Michael turned around, like that's how Smokey Natural on a natty, his eyes was like the hair. Then the Diana stories. It is just like he did something. And I put a little bit of that on all of the all time greats. Oh yeah. Anyone from that era. Yeah. It was doing some It was walling. Yeah, it was walling. I thought. 'cause he survived. He was the one. No, it wasn't like that. No, no. But not think about, last time I saw smokey rappers, he had a, a face full of makeup. That's what I'm saying. He got the Sammy Solsa going on as it turns out, he didn't second that emotion.


Oh, sh slap me. I'm here week. I got DVDs for sale as you exit on the left hand side. And, and listen, we wanna be sensitive to victims of the victims. Of course, of course. Of course. We are not, we are not. Definitely not laughing at ain at know what our experience. We laughing at the shock from black Americans that Smokey Robinson's name is in this. Ha Have y'all seen any of like the, the footage from smokey shows like his, some of his recent stuff? Yes. He's still trying to grind on stage and he looked like the the horny old man that did that shit, don't he? That's why we gotta even question his name.


Like why do you need it to be smokey? Hey, hey, last week it was just smooth. But today, if that Fark machine get heavy Looking like a cover Yeah. Like a smoke bomb. Just for Smokey's credit. His lawyer did respond. Okay. Fight back his lawyer, Christopher Frost said that the accusations were false and vile. And Mr. Another lawyer for Mr. Robinson, I was same lawyer for Mr. Robinson, said it was an ugly method of trying to extract money from an 85-year-old American icon.


No, this is a, It is a great way to do it if you did it right. I thought it was interesting that he said American not African American or black. I think that's an interesting card. Most people don't play that card. Like, you know, puff plays the, you know, they trying to get a black man smoke. Smokey was like, I'm an American icon. The second thing I thought was interesting about It is the timeline. And again, I I'm I I don't doubt the the accusers at all. But I think there is an interesting question. I wanted to know what y'all think about how, how does somebody end up in a situation where they worked for Smokey Robinson for 16 years or 18 years and get, and get assaulted and abused over 16 to 18 years. That's a question that they're gonna have to answer. What do y'all think?


How does that happen? I can't answer you on air. I can't answer you neither. Okay. No, I can answer You. Right. I got, I mean, I can't answer. You wanna hear though, little power, power, power dynamics. A little money. Screw that over. Yeah. Pop, yeah. I guess power dynamics, because I, I've seen situations. I'm not saying It is a smokey situation, but I've seen situations. What? Yeah, what you see. Tell us doc, where people have made arrangements with domestic workers. Mm. Sometimes undocumented ones, especially I've seen it with undocumented workers. Yes. Where they are washing and drying and cleaning, but also expected to perform also washing and other duties and cleaning. Exactly. Oh, see that's what I was gonna say off of air. And that's what I'm saying for you. But you said it better.


Yeah. And after they get the that and that saw my peers working that together, that boy PhD and after they get their green card of citizenship, things start to get a little foggy. Sometimes it's a little smoky. Yeah. Some sometimes, but then other times It is not even about this that it's just, that just reflects the power dynamic and the money stuff. Sometimes it's just like you hear and you hear and you gonna stay. And not Only that, they can actually use that as like, you know, like a tool to keep you in place. Yes. Right. I will, you know, I will vouch for you. I will, you know, sponsor You. Right. But then that process never actually happens. Right. They drag it out for as long as they can and knowing that you are trapped, you can't really Exactly. And that's just one theory. And these people may not be undocumented.


They might, they not. We're specula speculated. That might not even be the story. But I do want people to understand there's a value in being able to keep your dirty laundry, no pun intended. Right. And some people are paying for that. And I'm not, to be clear, I'm not saying that that is exculpatory. I'm not saying that that means he isn't guilty. I'm just saying for some people they can't imagine how somebody could be assaulted over 16 years. It it, they think that has to be a lie has been made up. Sometimes it's not. Sometimes people get tired of it. Sometimes people get in better situations and they think better of it. Sometimes the person in control changes the, the, the rules of engagement. And you like, no, I I did that, but I didn't agree to do that. And then, and it gets and it gets worse. So, and the last thing is Smokey's wife is also, She's named in the lawsuit. She's Named in the lawsuit. She's named in the lawsuit for having be been aware of past settlements that were filed and and settled.


Right. But she's also, but we didn't know and Yeah, exactly. In turn it goes back to what you were saying, like we never knew anything. He's been keeping a lot of stuff under wraps. But in addition to that, knowing full well what was happening and that she would leave and go to the nail salon when she knew that these acts were taking place. Not one of the girls said that if she didn't do what he wanted, the wife would be mean to him. Yep. Yes. Yeah. So she might have been extra like, this might be a whole freaky domestic arrangement going on. Or it could just be, yo Yeah, y'all know what you're here for and if you're not doing that, yeah, I got a problem with You. Right. I'm not fucking So that's how she get grouped in there. Yeah. Right. I'm not fucking them. That's y'all. Yeah. So we'll see what happens. But this is a hell of a way to end your career when your final tour and that ends the age old debate about which cruising is better.


DeAngelo or Smokey. Thank god we got a backup foul that, anyway. Oh, y'all gonna stop playing Smokey Robinson music now. I wasn't necessarily playing. I play a lot. I play Smokey Robinson and I don't know, I don't know yet. I'm gonna say this case resolves itself. There we go. Till then you better shop around For somebody else. Listen Of a clown. And it ain't just smokey. They got Byron Scott. Oh, I, oh that's another one. Yeah. See that got Byron Scott from some shit. Byron Scott is a, a old basketball player.


Basketball player and coach, former coach, the Lakers played for the Lakers said 38 years ago, the Lakers filmed an instructional video at an LA school. Byron Scott, who was 26 at the time, took a 15-year-old student in the janitor closet and tried to have sex with her. She alleges in, in her lawsuit file last week. Scott says he thought she was 18. That was his Oh wow. Retort now. Yeah. Wow. Oh my god. Yo Byron. I mean he need help. Byron, you could tell when a nigga just can't afford a lawyer, you could tell when they don't have a lawyer friend. You could tell when somebody just didn't run this by anybody. Holy Byron said, shit, I hope Byron ain't See that.


Byron better not have said that. That wouldn't be the greatest response. That would be a horrible response. It It is. And just to be clear, it's your responsibility to find out the age of the person that you're being intimate with. It is, that is true. They lie what happens then? But he didn't say them. Yeah, but the 22-year-old, you're in a high school. Oh, no, no, no. I'm just saying I've, we've seen I say this because I saw an episode of SVU that was kind of like that where she met the dude at the bar and of course, of course it's a TV show, but she met the dude at a bar, said how old he was and was lying and had a fake ID and they still charged it. It was like, yo, that, that don't mean nothing.


I'm just gonna say as a general rule and principle, you should not be rocked up in the high school. Right. You should not be on one when you walk into the local public school. You gotta find out old people on, there's a good point though. Like You can't just be in the home neck room. Yeah. That's 10. Right. It's A pretty good blanket. And that That just so we clear No, he, him from himself. That was his lawyer that said that. The lawyer said that that was his lawyer that Oh wow. He needs to fire him. The victim was of legal age at the time. Oh, that's different. No, he says our client is devastated by this complaint. A basketball event that took place in 1987. Our client believed the plaintiff to be over 18 and had no idea she would claim otherwise until 35 years later.


He respects girls and women and the claims have blindsided him and his family. That ain't that. That's Because the jury still thinks you're a creep. It just thinks you're in high school trying to fuck an 18-year-old. Not even that. It still sound like you tried to take it side of the fast breaker. Hollywood, Showtime, Los Angeles, Lakers. You are in Los Angeles nigga. It's pussy being thrown at you by the pound. You going to any school and fucking a girl that goes to that school is crazy. Right. Yeah.

Yeah, you could be a whore with the Adults on Sunset.

Yes. 27 years old was charged Tuesday with killing an 18-year-old high school senior Michael Bosworth Junior and injuring one of his friends during what police initially reported with an attempted burglary around 3:00 AM The Spotsylvania County Sheriff's Office said Butler claimed to detectives that a trio of teens were trying to break into his home.


But the wounded teenager insisted they were only recording a prank that would later be shared on TikTok. Butler has been charged with second degree murder, malicious wounding and use of a firearm in commission of a felony. Was Butler in his own house? Yes. Yes. Butler was in his home. They said the part that they failed to mention in this report was other homes in the neighborhood had been burglarized. And the community was speaking to each other about, Hey, be careful. Homes are being burglarized in the area. So when he sees these three teams in his yard ringing the bell or whatever, they were going back in.


No, they was kicking the door. They was, they was, they claim they was playing Dingdong Ditch, which don't even go like that. No, don't. And it's three three. They were kicking the door. Yes. Like trying to kick in the door. And it's three in the morning. Oh No. You're getting shot. Yeah, You're getting shot. You're Getting shot. You Are absolutely getting shot. I, I agree that you're getting shot. Yes. Yeah. If someone's kicking down my door at three in the morning, FA, if you are at my house and you're not ringing the bell at three in the morning, if you're Ringing my bell at three in the morning, if you ringing, I'm still reaching. You're not getting shot. You're not getting shot. But you doing anything around the grounds or any of that, my nigga? You have no reason to be in my house at three. And to, and just to be clear, they do not know each other. The three guys in Butler do not know each other at all. No. There's no, okay.


There's no prior history as of this report. Three teens, white, white teens, white boys, and the black man that's black. So my question to y'all was gonna be, do y'all feel like this man should have been arrested? No. Not at all. But you to, You gotta know that I, I I didn at first, but I thought about the Stand your ground. No, The, the, the shooting on the movie Rust where we were saying like, just because someone was killed, the process should be started and needs to be cleared. So I do think, huh. But we would, so so when I thought about that, I'm like, okay, I understand. 'cause again, they don't know the full situation at first. So, okay, we have a shooting here, three in the morning. This person shot him. We arrest him as the details come out.


We drop the charges and he should, he should be cleared. 100%. Do you think race play a role in this? Absolutely. Well, I don race everybody role in everything. Yeah. Okay. So, yeah. Can't ask if when I saw it, this was in Reverse. If this was in reverse and it was three black kids, one of them ended up dying. It was a white man, they would never even think to arrest him. They would interview him at his home and they would let him fucking stay there. That They would, they would process him. That's, I don, I don, I just, I don't believe that at all. The place they process Daniel Penney. It Depends, depends on the place. Daniel Penney's. Who? Daniel Penney. Because, Because people, It is New York, because people, and exactly. That people witnessed him Murdering Jordan. I just looked up the Virginia law. So I think that it's, it's a case by case basis.


I think that depending on whatever the law is in your state, yeah. You right. Then they need to move accordingly. In Virginia, it says that you could re you can use reasonable force in self-defense when they believe that they're in imminent danger of harm. So if three dudes are trying to enter my house at three o'clock in the morning. Mm. That's, that's after there's been mad break-ins. That's The definition of Imminent harm. You get shock, my nigga. I, I expect, I ex I I I'm struggling with that. Go ahead. Y'all go ahead. And I, I'll say this, I would do the same thing he did and I wouldn't hesitate, but legally it just gets gray in terms of what constitutes imminent. Like legally, like imminent. If someone's not back kicking my garage door and I'm in the bedroom, that's not such imminent.


Legally I could still get away. I could still escape. Like, you don't, you don't have a, you don't have a legal duty to a legal Right. To protect property. You can only protect yourself, stay your ground. But I don't believe that the focus should be on imminent. I think the focus should be on what he believes to be imminent. Yep. And that's, and that's the police defense in every single one of these situations. Absolutely. They say, yo, I thought I was in fear of my life. Yeah. I thought that this person was gonna harm niggas. Even though they completely unarmed. It could be five foot, two 70 pounds. You facts, you three 50 and you could say, yo and Virginia has no stand your ground, I mean, has stand your ground. Right. So you're right. So stand your ground. I don't have to run. Yeah. I can stand here. I don't have to be in retreat. Right. But the problem is, if you upstairs and some, again, I'm not disagreeing With You in terms of, I I agree with everything he did.


I'm just saying legally he's gonna have a tough road. I'm just saying It is gonna be, it might be a tough case to beat and the race card is gonna play a part of it because they give a lot more leeway for white people. Because the standard is what is, what would a reasonable person do? What would a reasonable man do? Reasonable. Whereas with the cop, it's, what would a reasonable cop do? The reasonable cop standard is different than a reasonable man standard. I don't see why you're saying you think he'll have a hard time because people fear black people. Well, I know the race card plays. No, I'm saying that's a big part. When you have a white jury and you say, yo, I was in fear of my life 'cause this big black guy came at me. Right. All of the jurors are going to Say, Yeah, empathize with that. That's reasonable. I'm gonna call to theand all of the neighbors that have been burglarized. True, true, true. Because that, that plays a part.


It does. Or any of them assaulted though, so, well, that doesn't matter. It does. Listen to what I'm saying, you can't defend property. You can only defend yourself. So if my belief is that they're gonna come in and steal my tv, at least I can't shoot the way. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. I wanna respond to that. But if I, but if I, if you're on property that you shouldn't be on at 3:00 AM then I am defending myself when I see you on my property. This is like the baby shooting at homeboy that was climbing the climbing the gate. Yeah. In certain circumstances, force can be used to defend property as well. Right. In certain circumstances in Virginia. Yeah. So, so the question, this would be one of those times, I, I to agree to me, I'm saying to y'all, listen, it depends on what the water of the law, the castle doctrine states that deadly force is generally permitted in one's home.


If there's reasonable belief that an intruder would cause bodily harm. So if I catch, I don know that if I catch these three dudes downstairs, so they might've got the burglaries off because the people were asleep. Now what happens if I'm coming downstairs and I trigger these niggas? Now it's a fight to death. But then also let's You, right now it's kitchen knobs involved. Exactly. Now it's potentially, But then also let's use some other. But they would say, don't come downstairs, stay upstairs. No, But then Fuck that. Let See That I'm saying You use some dif use some different language because this is, this is a home invasion. And when you change the language, that's true. Each, you change how people perceive the incident itself. But they didn't get In. They were trying to, they were trying. Right. They were trying. And so it looked, you know, in prior experience or or in prior situations, they had succeeded.


You know, that's using, I get it. That's usually the idea that they are responsible for the burglaries in the neighborhood. And how many op and how many times do we see burglaries result in the homeowner, you know, or people being killed, being killed, attacked, or named or attacked or whatever the case is. Because they get the burglars get caught. Yeah. So to me, this is the definition of imminent danger. And also who the hell's thinking about legalities when you hear people trying to break into your house at three o'clock in the morning And, and, and may we saying here dude could be looking at the ring camera. Now I'm watching people trying to get into my That's true. One. No, I, I would, which makes me now I'd be like, what? Let me go get this Roscoe. Right. All I'm saying, I'm not saying I would do anything different than he did. I'm just saying legally, it's not as open and shut as we as people are makingand it sound understand.


I'm just saying. They're gonna be fighting over that. The prosecution wants him in jail. They're gonna be using the word imminent. And they're gonna say, you weren't in imminent jail. They were outside your house. They were kicking on a girl. That's why they charged him. 'cause they're saying it wasn't imminent. That's The circumstances. Right. Like if he gave them warnings, maybe shot a shot in the air or something like that. Which, Which you're not allowed to do and they ignore. Okay. I Don't know. That's what I'm, these these are things that like people do and in practice they work. Yeah. But legally, if they decide to prosecute you for it, you can't. Like did it Marissa Alexander shot a warning shot in Florida up in 10 years. Yeah. Like they don't, so I'm just saying like, don't, this ain't gonna be an easy one. Esp. And, and the problem is in Florida, Virginia, Texas, a lot of times the Castle doctrine. The Castle doctrine and what's the other one?


Sandra? Your ground are laws to help white people. Yeah, I was about to say, I was about to say It is if there was a racial, when a white person dies. Yeah. Where murdered. Yeah. But the fact white person, you have no problem. Yeah. But It seems like he was arrested based on the testimony of the people that were the guy who was Bri. Not just surviving teens. Exactly. The surviving teens. So that's why he gets like, to me, that part. So they basically take their word and they're the ones committing the crime. That part to me just seemed like they were trying to protect themselves real fast. Like I, when I read this, I'm like, this probably was the niggas doing the break-ins got caught and said, no, we wasn't doing that. We have to justify being at this man's house at three o'clock in the morning. Right. Right. And other ways to justify prank should not justify it at all. Or show us a track record of your TikTok pranks. Right, right, right.


Show, show us your clips on TikTok. Lemme ask you a question. Somebody breaks in your house and you, and you reasonably think they're just stealing. Do you still, do you still shoot? Yeah. Yep. How can I reasonably deduce that? That's why it's a, it might be unfair, hypothetical, I guess so I'm just asking 'cause Cory just said yes immediately. I don, I don, I don know what judge's stealing means is you'd rather be caught with it than caught without it when something is happening. Right. So when I'd rather be judge 12, this guy. I feel you. Yeah. Yeah. The reason I'm asking is because a lot of us, myself included, I hate guns. Like I hate condoms, don't like to feel to it, but gotta be safe. So I still use it. That boy was a beast. That boy was absolutely a monster. Don't play with him anyway.


I'm sorry, mark. No, no, no. What's that uncommon sense he playing With You? That wasn't a good line. All right. That was, that was, that was crazy. But it's cool. Crazy. He owe me that. It's all yo. No. Well my man said on, he's a dead dog. Yo. What It is. I'm gonna light your ass up. You can't, you can't judge the what? What? Oh, maybe they won't do this or do this in that moment, bro. They in your crib. I'm not criticizing. I'm just saying, man, they steal shit. Shit. What if I think the good shit to steal is in my room. Right. Right. I've Been in a situation where I was home where someone tried to break in my house and I grabbed a knife 'cause that was what was right there. And he ran off. So I guess I would, to answer your question, no, I wouldn't immediately just kill the person trying to enter my house in my Gun.


You just shot. I still wouldn't shot. I get them niggas off. For me it would be a little bit different. I, a different consideration could Used hand. So yes, I am fucking shooting because I don't know why you're here. If you're here to steal or if you're here to, to assault you. Yeah. To assault me. So, yes. I'm fucking, I'm shooting regardless of somebody in my, you might be, yo, you could scare somebody and then their react. They might not have had no intention on doing you not how many movies that should be watching. Yo, it's only supposed to be a robbery. It's only supposed to be a robbery and then somebody spook 'em. Mm. And now it's the scary one. Done reacted and fuck this whole show. No. Well, one of the three niggas is irrational. Yeah, bro. Alright. What you did, what you did Parks, if he'd have showed yourself man, tall with the knife. And then dude just kept walking for it. Skinny ass out.


Watch out. Yo. How long ago was this? Five years ago. Was that, Oh that's long. Shit, It wasn't that long ago. Yeah. Oh yeah. At the end of the day though, just we can't use legally, we can't use our guns to protect property. We can only use it to protect ourselves. So all I tell people is if you're going to do just not to be making, when the police come Shoot the injure and not to kill, No, shoot the kill. But tell the police that that that person, I mean, I'd be like, yo, he said he was reaching for a gun. He said, you about to die. No, in New Jersey it's, It is different. 'cause you like, if, if you shoot him in the back, it's different than if you shoot him in the, in the front. I feel like, well in Jersey you gotta be careful. The last time somebody broke into my crib and tried to steal all my shit, there was really nothing I could do.


She was so beautiful. Damn. You couldn't shoot up. Don't leave me something you couldn't do. Nothing. Just had stop fucking me. So, damn. Oh shit. Fuck. Leave me something. It's crazy. Some bullshit.

It was, they said it was impossible. They said these guys were the D defending champions. I heard that. They said Jason Tatum had a chip on the shoulder. 'cause Steve Cur sat him on the end of the bench at the Olympics. That was the whispers. Yep. But it looks mighty different today. Shout To all the Nicks in the past. You and John Stark.

That was time to ride. DJ scratch. You sick for this one? There we go. That's my shit. Let's go bust him.


One of the most important rules to me, especially at my age today, is on time. On time is early. I mean, early is on time. It is on time and on time. On time is late, is late. It's very important for me not to feel rushed, anxious. It is very important that I take my time with things today because the way that my brain functions and by the time it tells whatever part of me is supposed to put it in action, I need time to go through these, each step carefully and cautiously and putting my best foot forward.


And I'll confide in you guys for a minute. Oh, recently, recently. I didn't do that. I didn't do that recently. Recently I was without I, I didn't do my due diligence. I was extremely irresponsible. I was anxious, I was rushed. I was ill prepared. When I called originally to purchase my Nicks versus Celtics tickets, I aware that we didn't have home court in this series.


I tried to purchase tickets for game three, which was at the garden. I made a mistake, unlike any other I purchased for game six. I Know it son a bitch. I know it. I hate him so much. I know it. I said I knew where he was going. A real piece of shit, man. Cook Game six is to be played next week at Madison Square Garden If necessary. Yeah. Yeah. It's gonna be the asterisk, the it got. It's right there. And the language between me and my Knicks personnel must have not been clear.


I was calling it game three, but in the garden language, it's the, they took that as the third game. At the garden. At the garden. And because I've read the 48 Laws of power and what would the Rockefellers do? This nigga's good boy I know to always have a healthy respect for my opponents. Especially when they're the defending champions. And especially when they're so well coached. But boy did I make a grave mistake Thinking they was well coached. Thinking it was gonna go to six. It's going to six. Man, fuck this guy.


Why on God's green Earth did I have a fucking six game in play? Why the fuck did I think this could possibly get to? Six games, the nerve of you. How in the fuck did I imagine we would need to come back here for a game six to be played? Boo boo the fool. Talk about a total miscalculation of how things would go. The nerve man.


Oh yeah. Little Face game. A game. Six. Six. I told my co-hosts that we weren't pleased with just one. Oh, that we were looking to go up two zero. And in case they were here, just absent-minded or not listening to me, which happens a lot. I retweeted it just in case people missed it. They laughed. We did. They scoffed. Told you you was crazy. Told me I was a fool. Yeah, a fool. Even along with the rest of the world, ladies and gentlemen, it don't look like we will need a game six.


And normally in this instance, wait, what is wrong with me? Normally this has never happened before. Wait. There is no, normally, this has never happened before where a team has gone on the road down 20 back to back games against the defending champion and willed their way to a fucking victory. You bitch ass niggas. You've never fucking seen it normally Jamal Anyways, watching the games.


Actually I don't wanna hear from Brian Hurst ever again. Brian Hurst and all of y'all that we could clearly tell are rooting for the Celtics, which you can't spell without sell. We don't need to hear from y'all ever again. Brian Hurst wake up every day looking as angry as he could be. That he gotta find a way to report on the Knicks being up to nothing. I had to hear from all of you Fucktards out there to gimme with all of the metrics, all of the, the Knicks are O 10 versus winning teams. Their Knicks are o and six versus the Boston Celtics. The Knicks are. Brian Hurst woke up the other day and said, Hey, hey, hey. The Celtics had Mikel bridges shooting the ball in the fourth quarter. He shoots 26% in the fourth quarters.


That's exactly who we, I keep hearing for people who clearly don't watch fucking basketball buy these niggas. Get some people that watch The Game. I've gone to these games, I've been to the games. The first Celtic game we lost by 40 Nicks was just walking around out there, took a friend of mine. It was embarrassing. We left early one of them other games. We wasn't there. We wasn't the healthiest. And in another one of them games, if you watch these games, Brian Hurst. It is easy to tell that the shit that Mikhail Bridges did in the fourth quarter the other day that you said everybody was so surprised about.


He's done that all fucking year. There are montages going around of the amount of times Bridges has saved Nick's games with his heroics in the fourth quarter. That's when we start posting the meme that says, fuck them picks we gave. And I gotta watch The Game and look at Jason Tatum, who's my man? Shall the Jason Tatum, who's my man, have the nerve to have a crisp shape up to that stupid ass part in your hair? Oh, you not here for business? Oh you not focused. You had time to hit the barbershop. You bitch ass nigga.


Oh, you wanna look cute? You got the nerve. They have a perfect shape up in the playoffs. Hey, we knocked the fucking condescending out the coach. He gotta sit there post game and give real answers. Now they coach who I love all that quirky, condescending shit he do. I Love it. But guess what, when you're down oh two in your building as the defendant champs, when you don't call a timeout, when you leave Mitchell Roberts in, in here with your little fucking hacka shackled, you stupid motherfucker when you do all of that, we knock the quirkiness out of that boy.


I would say get the brooms. But I think that broom, I think that would be a total misrepresentation and an understatement for what's going on. And if you're a Knicks fan out there and you're screaming get the brooms, you not really seeing the play. Yes, these niggas might get swept. Call the cleaning crew, not Smokey Robinsons. Oh Man, we might need to go and get the big hand, the big carnival. The hand they give you at the fair, the big styrofoam hand so we could wave goodbye.


Wow. This may be the last time that we even see this team together. Mm damn. Break him up. Hey he talking crazy man. If we win today, grand closing. Bye bye bye. Hey, The coach is gone. He should be Pritchard is gone. Somebody that you like is outta here. I told y'all niggas that the Boston Celtics were hurt beyond repair. They are hurt way more than they're giving off. They look like shit out there.


The coach is being severely outcoached and I don't know if Jason Tatum and Jalen Brown like each other, these niggas will knock pass each other the ball for nothing. I never seen a defending champion so tighten their ass. Pause. So uncomfortable with the lights bright. Oh my favorite part of this is I don't even watch the Celtics anymore. I watch the fans. I watched the bench. I watched the life be sucked outta your pathetic building. I watched some little young New York white kid pull a fire alarm on you bitch ass niggas at the end of The Game.


You niggas were scurrying that nigga. Hey y'all lost, y'all don't get the fuck beat without fire. And they scurried out of the building. Y'all beat some of us up outside. I seen the footage. They was so mad. They caught one of the Knick fans in front of Tony's pizzeria or some shit. Beat the brakes off of him. Sorry little Jewish Billy. We had to take one for the team. Hey, if you know Boston history, y'all knew white Nick fans went out there with too much bravado. Anyway, all that footage, that shit y'all do on 34th Street. Ah. Nick, Nick, Nick.


Hey you better go read up on it. Hey go look at the Martin Luther King statue in in, in Boston. If you wanna know what's gonna happen to you, look what they did to Martin. I ain't gonna talk too much. I'm just happy there for the first time in a long time. There is a viable road to the NBA finals. We seem to be healthy. I was outside watching this game. We were in Brooklyn and Williamsburg. We had a session. Oh shit. The game's on second quarter. We walk in there. Wasn't looking so good, you know, wasn't looking so good. But that crowd, it was probably 200 people in there we're standing, standing at the table eating tacos.


It was was like we were in the fucking garden. Defense. Defense. You right. What The fuck you like all that in concert? The whole 300. Well Boston reports were telling us that 18% of the ticket sales were from New Jersey. New York? New York. Yeah. The New Jersey, New York area. Oh. Oh. Niggas don't do that discussion. Oh no. Niggas travel for sure. Tickets to game three are the MO is the most expensive Nick playoff ticket ever. I can imagine. The last time I reported on this, I was wrong the last time. It was the most expensive first round playoff ticket ever. Not the entire playoff. This is the playoffs. But this is a real expensive ticket.


I expect that building to be absolutely on fire. And the Boston ticket is cheap. It gonna be crazy. And the Boston ticket's cheap. I love them up. They they relatively cheap. They're relatively cheap. You get some decencies for like six six, not cheap. If you count the beat up that they're going to, they count not cheap. You count the hospital bills and all of that. No, I have a Tatum jersey on that building is gonna be absolutely on fire. I told y'all that. We got a shot. If Tatum is gonna play fragile, Hey I got a stat for you. I'm not gonna look it up 'cause it don't really matter because Josh Hart has scored more points in almost half the field goals than Jason Tatu. Yeah. Like 11 points in the end of the, towards the end of the fourth.


I think Josh Hart had scored 46 points. I'll find it. And Jason Tatum has scored 45 points on way more field goal attempts. I gotta say there Was some Celtics, there's four Celtics fans at the bar right at the corner. Right by where we were standing. I was surprised how kind and generous the Knicks fans were to them. Mm. I mean everyone pointed at them and laughed a little bit. But like it was cool And not like Boston. You getting Josh hard 37 points on 24 field goal attempts. Jason Tatum, 36 points on 42 field goal attempts. Oh that's wildly inefficient. Ain't gonna get it done if, if, if part of why I gave Boston so much credit was because Jason Tatum to me had took the leap with the chip on his shoulder from the Olympics. He was looking like something this year.


Listen, when I went to See that game at the garden, let me be the first to tell you Jason Tatum looked like Michael Jeffrey Jordan himself. He did whatever he wanted out there on that court. He looked like Kobe being Bryant out there. But it's only one problem with that audience. He's not Antoine. There's only one problem with the scenario I just laid out. He's not, you wanna make him mad. He's not Michael Jeffrey Jordan, you wanna make him mad? Hey, he's not Kobe Bryant. He's not them 35. Huh? 35.


35. What? You know niggas come to life in the garden. Well that exists. So we don't want to get to that or that's what I'm saying. You're trying to make him mad. He y'all knocked them. He may give y'all a nickel. He's knocked them. That's what I'm expecting. He give you only problems with what I just said. He give y'all a nickel. Hey It is easy to look like them niggas. Hey it's real easy. Hey, everything is good when we order farming out there. You know what I mean? Everything is cool when we got the jacket on and the locker taking the pictures like Kobe, there's only one problem rest beat Kobe Bryant. You are not. You gonna no problem with that Melyssa Ford. What's that? He is not there. No, he's not at all. Not even a little bit. Ooh. Oh You know he watch.


I wouldn't give a fuck what he doing nigga. Nixon four bag I got present for you. Fuck you said that last time nigga. Nixon four. Why I can't present for you dog YI ain't sleeping five Nixon. Six Nixons got him outta here. I don't give a fuck Ice. What you got there? You being thoughtful again. You being thoughtful. Okay. He's opening up a box. All right. What we got free Okay there. Ooh, it's a basketball with Nick's jerseys in in it. Okay, look at that. Look at that. Oh Look at Mark. Disgusting That that is from Disgusting. A guy Victor Solomon, he designed like all the courts during the end season tournament.


The All-Star game rings. Oh wow. He, he's a designer. But he sent you a Yeah, you can rub. Ooh, look at that. This is nice. It Is fire. And there's flowers in it too. Yeah, He gives Nick Flowers. Look at that. Look At that fucking Boston Celtics. I can't wait for this shit anyway. Wait for shit. Anyway, congrats to the Knicks. Congrats to all Nick fans out there. Hey, get your styrofoam hands ready. We'll never see these niggas together again. Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. We've seen Stranger Things happen. Did y'all play Indiana last, last year?


Yeah. And how many, how? How did the first two games go? We won the first two games. They was up oh two. And then how the series in, we lost the series. Okay. Just making sure the entire team was hurt. I know you don't watch basketball because black power or whatever you be doing. Nah, I just, I just seen, I just seen Knicks fans get hyped loose before. Yeah. He's taking the stance. Yeah, I know you don't watch basketball because my stance is fucked the Knicks because John Na Smith sexually assaulted somebody. Yo, come on man. No you don't watch sports. But they one come here and talk shit. Hey yo, a six fan shouldn't be allowed to talk right now. That's why I'm quiet. You shouldn't even be allowed. But that's your problem. You don't know when you shouldn't be talking to somebody. We'll get to that, but we'll get to that. We'll get to that in a second Big dog.


As a fellow fan, you see I'm shutting the fuck up. I I know, I know. I just, I, I let him have his runway. But it's six fans won't shut the fuck up. They don't have to shut up right now and then they go back to losing again. But we can't even say that to them. You know what, You right. The process last year when we lost to the pace, our entire team got hurt. We was already hurt but then everybody else got hurt between games one and game two. And I love the Pacers doing what they supposed to do to Cleveland. That's, that's important to me. Right. I love the Pacers because they didn didn't expect that because they not scared of nobody. I did not expect that. That they not scared of nobody. Hey, Halliburton got that chip on his shoulder. Y'all said he was the most overrated player in the league. He busting ass over there. I know Cleveland is hurt. But the lights get bright.


The lights get bright. Let's see what y'all, I can't wait to see. Hopefully both the Knicks and the Pacers close this out. I don, I think this series is not over yet, but it's over. I would love to see Knicks. Cleveland. Cleveland. No, I'm talking about the Knicks now. Never underestimate the heart of a champion. Anything. What Rudy Temp Jono said when they was down two Oh or three? Yeah, but that's different. When you rip, rip someone's heart outta their chest through the flesh and hold it in your hand and watch the blood pouring onto the ground, then there's no heart in there anymore. Wow. Wow. Then that's just like an empty corpse body walking around when you rip somebody heart out their chest. They so heavy right now. Can't I can't wait for y'all to lose two 20 point comebacks in the four. Yeah, I would talk crazy. Y'all crazy. I would talk crazy. I get, I would. I don't think that we should talk crazy.


I wouldn't talk. I do think you should. Crazy. I do think we should spot them. Wow. Wow. I don't think that we should talk crazy. Y'all are right. Well they had 20 point spots. Let's not put, come on Mel. Let's not put the horse before the cart. What do they say It is? It is the cart. Before the cart. Lemme not put goes horse and normally some shit. Chicken before the egg. Yes, exactly. Egg before the, I do think we should maybe spot them a few points. Not y'all spotted 'em 22 games in a row. Yeah, but I'm talking about at the start soon. Right at the beginning. Just start them with an extra 15, 20 and then maybe it'll be even. Wow. Damn. Even you know, because this is not fun.


I don't like seeing my team claw back. Oh no. This has been fun. I don't, I don't think so, man. Like I want games with some suspense as a Nick fan nigga. Y'all won by one point. The buzzer. That is, that is suspense. No, no. We won by 20 something points if we start the deficit from the fourth. Oh yeah. Get that. It is now. We won by one point we were able to climb back from 20 down. 73, 53, 75, 55 on two occasions. Babyface, I only think of you on two occasions. Game one. That's it Mark. That's it dog. Alright, I've already said too much.


One of these Celtics niggas will listen and use my voice for bulletin board material. Please Jalen and DM me about it. But just so the audience knows, I have not received a DM from anyone in the Boston area. Not Jason Tatum, not Tatu Tots. Not nobody ever last. Yeah, no, no. Nobody is nobody New Edition. The Walbergs. Yeah. No. Yeah, yeah. The Walbergs a good one. Nobody has hitting me from the Boston area in a few days. Yo. Actually I put it to you like this. I put it to you like this.


I am not bilingual. However, I bumped into the Korean broadcast of us putting belt to Celtic ass. And somehow I was able to perfectly understand everything that was going on. And if you think I'm lying I will play it for you.


Wow. Yeah, yeah. Yes you do. Last play 10 time. I got it. No. Yeah, That's exactly, Y'all make him boy mad. Oh no. He mad now. He mad. He bru run time Bru k Time gonna get y'all 50 Damn.


50 Tay time. Yeah. Yeah. But there's only one problem with that. What's that? The best player on the court might give you 52. Tatum is The best player. Knock it off. You trying to say Brenton the best player on the it off. The best player on the Stop it. Stop it. Don't be, don't be. Don't be stupid. You think don't be stupid. I don't think anything and you haven't earned the right to speak to me as a sticker fan. Don't be stupid. Don't stupid. You've lost the right to be Make it. Don't make me against me. Don't be stupid. Oh don't do that. Please don't do Ja Brunson say it with me now. I tried to get don't make me call Jerry Jack. I tried to get him to do it. Y'all, y'all have the chance to do it. Say it with me. His name Is Jalen Brunson. Okay. I mean y'all tried to, y'all what y'all tried to do the process his name is, well that too.


I'm talking about the Celtics y'all tried to do. His name is Jason Tatum and he ran right into where there were five Nick Defenders. We took the ball, threw it up in the air and The Game was over. Look, I ain't no Celtics fan. I just, maybe we understand Steve Kerr a little bit now with his thinking. Wow you really tried to get him some bulletin bullet. I mean we don't know. We don't know Jason Tatum, I love you. No he don't. Jalen Brown, I love you and Peyton Pritchard. I love you. That's how I know they're getting out. Coach my man. Peyton Pritchard ain't even been in the floor. Yo. Missoula has his coach pretty poorly. He's made some terrible fourth quarter dog. He's got Harford switching on to Jalen Brunson on the island. Yeah, I don't get that. It is bad Bro. He needs to get fired. If they lose, I wouldn't fire him. They're Gonna fire him.


They won't fire him If they go down three zip. He's losing his jobs dog. Let tell you something, it's hard to, if they go down three, losing his job, it doesn't happen. Most coaches never lose, get fired after they win a chip. I can only remember, I think Toronto dude did. But what I'm, I think but fam he's getting out Coach. You get 23 to two runs. You don't call a timeout. No, he, your team could be got fired after he won the coach of the year. Coach of the coach of the year next and the next coach won the championship. Boom. Yeah. Nick Nurse, I Thank you. Your guys might just be tired, draw up a play. Go back to what you were doing that got you up by 20. All he did was shoot jack three pointers the whole sec, third and fourth quarter. Both games. Yo what the fuck It is? Deja vu like yo nah fam, he's doing a horrible job.


I Like this 'cause I, I'm doing, I'm tired of the 3.3 point basketball fucking Same. Let's, Let's See it fail even the last shot. I don't think it should have been Tatum taking the last shot. I think it should have been JB JB Iss the only nigga that was going to the hole. You can go to the hole, you can get fouled, you can get a offensive rebound. You can a putback or you get a layup. What the fuck you giving the ball to Dribble Man to pull up. And I like Jason tm. Y'all know I like Jason Tatum. He just playing shitty. Like if his three ball ain't falling and he out The Game. Listen it coulda been Derrick White, van White Dana White J Little White Dana White. He white nigga. I mean hey, what you want me to say Buddy?


Nothing y'all won. Hey Nixon four I Don or Nixon half or Nick six. But K Nicks Nix. It's just K Nicks. That's it. That's it. It feels good. It feels good man. It feels Good when the hometown team wins. I'm, I'm excited for it. It's probably a great energy because you be in the city. I know it's, I know City's lit. City is lit. City lit. I was, I'm telling you was being at The Game. Yeah bro. Yeah I believe that. That shit Was, I was like, they Pouring down shit. I was in front of Madison Square Garden because I teach around the corner and I was talking shit at half time I was so ready to talk shit. The next day to y'all? Yeah, because y'all were up like what y'all up a bunch? When I looked like 16 or 18 or something. And then when I walked out I was right down Mass Square Garden also I was when go, oh my God. Wearing the crazy jerseys coming up bars and shit. Drunk whites. I was like it wasn't even a home game. You was just wearing jerseys, screaming, talking shit.


I hate them. Only thing worse than New York fans. The Dallas fans. It is like the two worst fans in the fucking world. I'll be a game three. Good. That fixed everything. That'll be a game three man that fix everything. Check for the boy. They the Celtics. Celtics probably bought you tickets on the floor. Check for the boy, you know what I mean? Yeah. Probably when it slab cam rolls around, you see me sitting right there. 50 of them is there. If not it, the celeb cam would come down 50 in the front row celeb cam won. Well that's how won't EB cam catch him? It gotta be another celeb near him. You gotta be another celeb. You can't just put 25 cent up DOL by your face.


You got When was that time y'all? When last, when they won The Game With You there? It's been a while. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I think they don't really win when I go. Yeah. Celtics would be very happy to see you there. Well, let's see, let's see, let's see what happens. Just make a quick phone call real quick. Then we could have our intervention Brother Brown or Tatum get 41 of them. Shit. Maybe might have 42. Baby My love. Hi. Yes baby. Remember when Mel told you to walk her dog? Oh my God. Instigated though a messy bitch Missy.


We joking. We joking. Listen, listen, listen baby. Yes It is official. I spoke to Scissor. She says she'll perform with your birthday. You know what? Because the, because the rain over here said it was gonna be the rain didn't miraculously, somehow the rain is gonna stop. It's not gonna be there. And because We on one of the biggest broadcasts in the world, I have to report on. I don't like how Parks and Ice and Mark and everybody's going to report on things when they go. So I have to go. That's a good one. And just See That now. I told them the conversation that you said we had that I forgot about and how I really feel horrible.


I did say that too. You feel if you're calling me while recording live? No, I feel bad about it. Okay. Feel. What are you gonna do about it Though? I might have to, I might have to pay. Oh Look I know my baby. Look, look. God, look baby. I might have to pay baby. I don know. I I I was so wrong. I might have to pay. Look. Lemme See What you think.

But we did because I That's supposed to go With You in Jersey.


I told them that exactly. I told so I mean look Yo, I spoke to Dot. He said he'll go on another run soon. Let's talk more shows left from the other. Don't about it. You gonna make me catch a flight? Hey, hey. Flip said you wasn't gonna answer 'cause you was on a flight already. No, he's like, I had a hair appointment. That's The, she had a hair appointment. See? And you got the people laughing out in the background. You got that lady in the back door here smiling. Stop on the flight. Don't, don't you, don't you, There's Still a lot of shows left. There's Lot of shows park, There's still a lot of shows. Left lot Any in Texas?

But, but We in here. Yo my baby's so unique. I ain't never even heard the I love you with the but. Right. I ain at the End that you ain't good nigga. You so special to me. But all alright, bye bye. Get outta there. Yeah. All that means is we don't talk after with a babe.


No. It made it worse. But that's a, that's such a Virgo thing. Like you want to make it a little worse. Just a little bit. You gotta make it up top. You can't, yo you can't fucking, you can't show a Virgo your fucking weakness like that. 'cause then we just gonna prod at absolutely all I guess all y'all got it. So most in a lifetime experience, you heard her say so you gotta be set. She sat in bar but there's bad. She sat the bar. No, she setting the bar though. And I learned that valuable lesson at 17 years old when my first baby mama looked at me as I held her shit out the window. She said, I dare you.


She said, pray for that. Your choices right now, if you throw my motherfucking shit out there, I swear for God. And I said the the gentlest. Yeah. From the, from the, from the third floor was a quick drop. And what happened after that? I went to jail. I went to jail. As it turns out, you can't do can't do that no matter who out you ain. Who the fuck? You can't do that. You cannot do that. What the fuck made me think that that was gonna fly.


Yeah, you can't. But it was just for the Russian. Oh man, I love my family anyway. Dark, dark Lamont Hill. Oh man. Let's talk to you man. Come on man. He looks like a 5-year-old right now. Come on man. We gotta talk to our brother man. We love you. We gotta help. That's how you start off in an intervention by telling you, by telling we love you a dark Lamont hill. 'cause I really think that Dark Lamont Hill played a part in this somehow. Like everything he do now, I don't see him as Mark. I see him as Mark slash Dark. Yeah. Because he got some of that Joe Bud podcast. Venom. It's like the evil Spider-Man now you like, like you in your Venom horror.


So when I see you on these platforms, I'm like, oh shit. And then you start turning up. So if you just join us, our brother Mark Lamont Hill has gone viral 'cause he went to his man Pierce and had a debate with people about whether or not it's okay to call a 5-year-old autistic child. A   say like that. It sounds absurd. One of who was a is a known racist that is like, she don't hide it. Well I wanna shoot Mark some bell because in the, in the community of people with an education when they do the debate stuff, so he tells me sometimes that you don't, you're unaware of who else is gonna be on a debate.


Okay. So you can't, so you can't research their points and yada yada yada. I see the reason all real time shit. That is true. Okay. But when my phone rings, let's play it out Joe, my brother. We got a debate for you. Alright, what's good? We wanna find out if it's okay to call a 5-year-old black autistic child a a   What? Say you I would in turn get off of that call and not oblige. You probably wouldn't even respond to them.


The floor is yours. Embrace us. Debate us. Yeah. How you ended up in this predicament. I was usually they call you three days ahead of time and say, Hey, we want you schedule for the show. You know, here's a topic. Never got, I didn't get a phone call from them. Instead I was on the way to the gym. It was 10:00 AM they called me and said, Hey, we need you in a pinch. Which basically means someone else canceled. Can you come on at 11 to discuss the GoFundMe campaign for the woman who called the 5-year-old black autistic child a   So I thought I was going on to discuss why it was fucked up for people to be giving her money.


Of course. And the idea was that they were gonna compare that to the people who were doing the GoFundMe for Carmelo Anthony. Got it. And so that was supposed to be the debate. And I was there to explain that those are apples and oranges. And also Because it's not GoFundMe for her, it's give, send, go. Right. It's Gib and go. Right. Yeah. What's what's difference, what's the difference? Gibs and Go is like the, is a GoFundMe created by like a this white Christian Evangelical, it's created By Block Block Inc. Yeah. But the, the, the, that's the tech behind it. Yeah. And, and the CEO o came on and he was talking about his Right evangelical right ring talking points. Right. So anyway, so I, I'm like, okay, that's a debate. I can, I can just say, look, Carmelo Anthonys people, they're not funding him for allegedly stabbing somebody. They're funding him. 'cause they think he got railroaded.


They wanted him to give legal defense. They're actually rewarding this woman for calling this black kid the N word. That's all it was supposed to be. So they said, well, they send the truck to your house. We'll go out, just come out, we'll have a conversation. I get home, no truck. I go in, there's nobody there. They called me and say, Hey, we had a little problem with the truck, so you're gonna have to go on Zoom and it's not a one-on-one. And I said, okay. So I log into the Zoom and I'm like, okay, well, you know, I, I don't usually ask who I'm debating because who cares. Like, I don't. Right. To me, it doesn't matter who I'm debating. Got it. Right. I I feel like I can hold my own. Right. Yeah. Him. Yeah. Yeah. But there's something said, who the fuck would take the opposite side of this issue? Yeah. Yeah. There you go. So You did know this was Pi Morgan, right?


Yeah. But usually Pi, usually when Pi doesn't tell me who It is. It is Candace Owens. Okay. And don't think if it was Candace Owens, that's fine. You Didn't think that he'd have some white supremacists on? No, I didn't. 'cause I didn't. 'cause the debate wasn't supposed to be about, if the debate was, should you call the kid a   Yeah. But the debate was supposed to be is the Carmelo and Anthony GoFund me the same as the go, send me go, you know, whatever you call the gifts and go for that one. So I thought you could just get a regular Republican. I thought it was gonna be some regular Republican shit. I said, who am I on with? They said, give us one second. So then they come back on, they fix my camera. I said, who am I on with? They said, just give us one more second and five. That's cell four. Yeah. Literally two. And that's what happened. And then they said, and joining me is, and they said, Lily, whatever her name is Li I don't know this white woman is, I don't, I don't watch TikTok.


Apparently she's a, a hardcore guy in the world. White supremacist. Then they had a liberal white woman on to kind of take my side, sort of. And then they said, and also joining us is Myron Gaines, who was fresh and fit. Who? The dude from Fresh and Fit. Okay. I don't know much about him, but the only time I've ever seen him on camera was dragging a black woman outta his studio, physically, him and his team. So, and I know he has said shit that's antisemitic anti-black. He, he hates black people. Right. He pretends to, he's a, he's a black, what do you call it? Like cosplay. He's from Sudan. He's a herb. Yes, that too. That too. Yeah. But, but he is an immigrant who pretends to be black. He's a bitch ass nigga. He is a bitch ass nigga.


Hey, what's his real name again? Amadou Del. Hey, Amadou. Oh, that's not his name. No, that's, I'm, he's a Sudanese immigrant that changed his name to American and pretends to be a black American. So when he talks shit about black Americans, it looks like it's coming from us. But it's really somebody else. He is not us. He's not our stock. He's not our lineage. He's, he, none of that. He's a fraud. Okay. So, so I didn't mean to step on what you were saying. No, no. I stopped myself. 'cause it's laws. Oh. He's about to say, I'ma do you dirt again. You know I'm gonna do No with Tom. It is, but my, my, my beef ain't even with him. I, on on this broadcast. We don't even bring light to Amadou. That ain't what we do.


I'm talking to my man. Homeboy is gonna homeboy I'm, I deal with that if we ever in the same space. But we never gonna be in the same space. 'cause I protect my space. And that's where I'm confused With You because I've gotten the time to, to spend some time With You and, and kind of get to know you better than I did with some of your beliefs and some of your, your history. It seemed, it seemed like you on some of that type type of time. But then you will create a space to share with these people, with these views and Yeah. I should have asked. But maybe there's po there's a possibility that they wouldn't have been honest With You since this whole thing.


No. They would tell you if I had, if I had asked at, at 10 o'clock and they said my, I would not have gone on. That's why they didn't tell me. They usually tell me. And when they don't, like I said, it's usually Candace and I'm like, you know, whatever. But, but that's why I fucked up. But not just him, but him and the little white chick. Yeah. I I should have Googled that. Who I wouldn't have known who she was either. However, I know that this platform that I go on has these ba debates stylistically. Yeah. So I should expect that It is gonna be some racist white girl who I, I don't, I didn't like seeing the, the smiling and the smirking when you was getting in your bag. The black person. That, that, that affected me differently than whatever the goal is in content world.


And now we have one of our brightest brothers, one of our most well-spoken brothers. I don't need to sing all your praises. You know how I feel about you debate with a bunch fucking space doof with just doof. That's not even a, and I know that you and I do know that you get off on sharpening a sword or just debating. I know that that's your thing. So I try to mind my business, but I'm compelled to tell you that you're missing out on one of the greatest perks to building your own. Owning your own and just creating your own, which is you don't have to share space with these people. That's real.


That's real. I should have walked away. And that's the thing. That and that's the, the Uber professionalism or, or that which I don't even wanna call it that. No, It is to, to a certain extent. It is. It is it like I gave my word. I'm here It is more professionalism. And not only that, but even that stop. 'cause even that's a backhanded compliment. Yeah. Even that is is some Westworld language that they convince you of. Yep. Being super professional. Which means we know what it means. I don't have to say what It is. Yes, yes, you are absolutely right. It means not ing when we give you a reason to, to, to, to   So yes, mark is a professional.


You'll let us play in your face. But Mark professionalism was never in question. 'cause Mark has made his rounds for over 20 fucking years. We are well versed on who Mark is. Exactly. Yeah. So are you saying It is because, are you saying it's because of his reaction? Because why wouldn't you share a space with them if, if he's there representing the culture, he can go in there and have the conversation and and explain to them why the two GoFundMes or the go ies are not the same. I think that sharing the space, sharing that space isn't a problem. But that's not goal. Are we basing this off of his reaction? How he exploded and how it was viewed? No. What are you basing it off? Because you're going to be in rooms with some of these people. You're going to be in the content world.


You're going to be set up and be put in these situations. How it's about how do you react, how do you, but he's trying to be, have a conversation with people who do not, they don't wanna have a conversation. He probably don't know them days. Wait, and I'm not That's fucked up. I don't think, hold up. I wanna reply to flip. 'cause I'm not just gonna let that go. Un un un unchecked. You are responsible for where you land in content world. Yes. And contingent upon how you view yourself slash your content. I'll use me for example. There will never be a space scenario or instance where in the name of content I'm sharing space with someone who proudly says, I think black people are   I think this 5-year-old autistic kid is a   I respect my right of free speech to be able to call y'all   And I don't care what y'all think about it.


It is not for me. I'm not telling nobody else can I respond to you after you finish for me. There isn't, there isn't a scenario you could create where that person has the opportunity. Hold on, hold on. I think, I think we got think, excuse me. Excuse me. I think we got solved, man. I watched Phil Donahue, I watched a lot of people from back in the days put different people to debate A white man. Huh? Excuse me, you naming a white man. All right. Oprah. Oprah. But you do that a lot. Oprah. Oprah where you compare Oprah, us to what white people do. Oprah. And I'm not gonna do that With You Oprah. Well I don't give a, It is not about that. What I'm saying is that we got, so when it come to content, you're always just trying to, oh don't put yourself in that position. When back in the day, society started like that. Niggas, people, people would put two people in the opposite side to have conversations.


Malcolm X, you could talk about Malcolm X, you could talk about whomever that happens. He didn't do nothing wrong. That's one little piece. And it happens. And now It is like, oh you can't be frowned upon it. You did what you supposed to do. You handled it how you supposed to handle it. You're going to be in the room with some of these people. Some of these people gain so much popularity, they gonna be in the same room as you see. I think we got soft by It is either you get up and you walk away. I think we got soft by letting Nazis and racists have a platform. Oh, let's hear their side. No soft. No soft. Alright. But the, the powers that may be are the one in power and the ones with the attention that can get you to spread your rhetoric around or spread or defend the culture mark. So sometimes you have to take that stance and say, I'm going in here to defend our culture. And it shouldn't be frowned upon on the man that goes in there and defend the culture.


And you can't have a conversation about yourself though. That's what some of these folks is not trying to have. People always want a cower but flip. Oh come on, I'm gonna save my space. Not you, I'm not making fun of y'all. But I don I don't think he wrong. Im just trying to tell you that the other side of that, somebody like that dude, he ain't trying to have a conversation. I don dunno anything about him. The first time I heard about him is when Joe did that footage. But everything you see from him does not show. He's trying to have a conversation. If two people wanna have a conversation and try to, I want to hear your side. I want to hear your side. That's one thing. Got it. If I'm in here, 'cause now in this level of content world, It is something different. It is. I gotta do the extras to go. I gotta, I gotta, it might not even be shit. I believe I just gotta do the extras so I can be seen. I'm not trying to have a conversation.


I'm not trying to hear you out. Why Mark, let me ask you a question. 'cause y'all come in here and stand on content over everything. So a lot of, I'm the only one that do that. And that's not true. A foolish angle. That's not true. He adopts some of these, some of these niggas believe in content over anything. Yes. So as loud and dumb as I could be, It is gonna get picked up by the network. So they running with it. Absolutely. Yeah. I don't believe in that. Mark, let me ask you a question. I don't believe in that. Lemme Ask you a question. When you saw the panel, and I know that a bunch of things, you know, went through your head as to whether or not you should participate, did it cross your mind that if I, if I leave then this panel, like there will no, there will be no proper representative of somebody who's intellectual, scholarly and can articulate the points, the the being on the right side of history.


Yeah. Is that, did you think that thought that before if before if you weren't part of this conversation, that it would it would just be it would just be them. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And it would be derailed by the racist bitch. I I didn you can't argue with fool. I have thought that before and that's been my, and that's been an argument that a lot of us use to go to these places that we want to be. And I think sometimes we use it to let ourselves off the hook. Like I can always convince myself that there's value in me being there. And for any of us, our presence is added value. But sometimes we don't wanna legitimize those spaces with our presence. Yeah. Got you. There's a lot of factors and, and everything y'all said is connected. There is the content thing. When I go on peers, three or 4 million people see it. Those three or 4 million people then often come to my YouTube channel. They then watch the stuff that I have to say.


And that is how The Game is typically played. Yes. He also lets me cut down the clips and put on reposition. I get paid from doing it. I mean there's a, there's, there is a, an angle to give or take politically and financially that I don't wanna be dishonest about. But then the other part of it for me is I do see myself as an educator. You are. And and I do think that intervening in those spaces and having a conversation that people otherwise won't hear does matter. But there has to be a line for me, Candace is like that line. Right. Candace is as extreme same as I wanna have a debate with. Same, yeah. By the way, and Myron Gay, I don't, I didn't quite un I I know he's a provocateur, but I didn't quite understand just how off ridiculous he was until I watched it. The white woman, I didn't know who she was and Pierce from what he told me afterward, didn't know that she was a white supremacist.


Now I, so I then that I'm, I'm curious as to how she even got on the show. Like how, 'cause all you gotta do in this content world to, to It is just say that kid deserved it. But who do they? And if you say that loud enough on TikTok, somebody will book you and give you a bigger platform. Got 'cause got. 'cause some people believe in content, know everything. I think she believes it, but I think she's just loud. She's not anybody of substance. Right. So she jumps up and does that. And so wait, Pierce said are, do you use the N word? Everybody thought she was gonna say no. 'cause I've been on TV for 20 years and no one's ever said yes. Even people I know who used it. And she was like, yeah wait, you used it at home? Yes I do. It could took him by surprise. I ain't see the whole thing. Yeah. But it took him by surprise. 'cause he kept being like so Right. You think you're a disgusting, deplorable individual.


And she was like, okay. Right. Whatever nigga. So I, that's how she was looking at it. Right. And that's the moment where I was like, where the fuck am I? That's the moment where I was like, wait, I'm on the, I'm on here with a woman from TikTok who calls niggas niggas at home and I'm here with Myron Gaines who now isn't the worst person on this panel if I'm on the panel with Myron isn't the worst person did he? What did he say? 'cause I ain't see, I didn't see him talk. So so that's the thing. Whatever he said, we not even saying. Yeah but listen, you saying he was bugging. I won't recount it. It was an hour conversation and he said, said all the shit you would expect him to say and then at the end when I did have that blow up, he's wa you Couldn they bleep it. But he was waving a flag that said   No. Oh okay. He was shooting. It was a gun. A gun, a gun. I'm sorry it's a bang.


Shout out of flag and it pops out with the flag. And I couldn't even See that part. Okay. That 'cause it was blurred out. You couldn't see it. No that ass But that back to my listen, the point is, okay, I see they could pull out rifles with flags to say,   they could do the   hokey pokey. They could do whatever they want by themselves. It is different with Mark while Mark is present. The second I'm sitting there, I see what you're sitting and I learn who this person is in real time. 'cause I do get Pierce might've been surprised too. And I get there's some trust between and Pierce your Pierce have a rapport. Yeah. We've been working together for 15 years. You weren't seeing any together. Yeah. But for me that contradicts the thinking of some of my Muslim brothers.


There's a common belief that I won't say. And if that a little bit of that is there, then I don't trust you enough with this Pierce. I can't, I don't care how long I've known you, I don't care about our rapport. Well I don't care. We going out for dinner. I cannot ethically and who I am and my whole, everything I ride for. I see, I see. Trust you, I See that. I see what you're a white man. I don understand to protect certain things. He's saying no matter what I can't, the rapport is I can't trust you. You cannot, you can't. Equity I built in the culture like who I am and I, and I feel like I can't trust you to handle this. Like how I would handle, or how my ancestors or family will want me to handle this.


And I know how Pierce handle shit. Right. So I already come in knowing he's cynical. I know that he will bring on somebody to say some wild shit. And I know he'll take devil's advocate position for the rating. So I already know that. Yeah. But I thought that the box was here, the Overton window as we call it. But when you do all of that with Pierce that you know, are you including in the tokenism? All of it. I'm factoring all of that in. And so I'm always making a judgment call about whether I, let's say this for every two times I go on, I say no five. I was about To ask like what, What did the circumstance, what the conversation is. Sometimes I'm like, nah, I can't be a part of that. What's the c What's one circumstance that you turned him down on? IIII, I'm meant, I'm interested to know. It doesn't matter. We take his word. We know him. No, I know. Just no, just point. I don't hear specifics. But I say this, I've, I've turned it out based on the guest. 'cause I don't want to legitimize a guest or share space with the guest.


And I've, I've done it based on the way a a topic is being produced. IE I'm not going to make it sound like to, to Parks this point that there's another side to this issue. Got it. You know what I mean? Like there's no, there's no yes or no to Nazim. It's just wrong. So I'm not gonna do on any other side because I don't wanna make it sound like this is a debate anybody should be having. So by the time I got to the end, my thing was, and some people I got all these ra I sent you a couple, well I think one of 'em, I got so many racist emails and tweets and te I mean, which always happens when I go on tv. Right? But this was very particular 'cause people thought I the right was or the conservative racist. Right. Was saying like, you know, he chimp out. That's what they always say. Right. That that that's the language they use. Right. That I chimp out over the n word that I got so upset about the N word. And I, I and people miss the point, I wasn't angry at the prospect of, of hearing the N word.


I hear the N word all the time. Right. I was, I I was frustrated with Pierce for trying to create a space to invite someone or dare someone to use that word. 'cause he shouldn't be able to do that. Right. Like if I'm the only black, like again, if they were, it would be like me saying, yo yo, yo, you won't, you won't, you won't say the B word. You won't say it. You won't say call it one. Go ahead. Right. Like who am I to invite you to do that? To prove, to prove your sex. I Feel like that was clear That that's what happened. The problem. But the problem, let me jump in unless you don't want it to be, but let me jump in again. That would piercers let me jump, let me just jump in again. Right here. The problem with what you're saying is that in 2025, a black person defending his right to not be called   by white people on tv right.


Is also a thing. Yeah. That part is a thing. So yes, it could have been a thing if I got this white woman to talk, how she telling me she talk, I see what the pierce play looked like. It could be, but what it ended up being has no place in 2025 also. And we do not need to watch our good brother Mark Lamont Hill, who might I add is on absolute fire right now. Word. Yeah. You are on an absolute tear. And I know this because the fucking black conscious community is calling me.


I have been on air for 10 plus years, they've never called me. So It is the thing now and in that, come on man, don't get me into all that. We gotta protect, you know, don't get me talking like my cousin. But no, You right. You're absolutely right to talk Like that. You're right. But you Are right. It's a ri it's a reminder not to let my guard down. It's a reminder to always ask where I'm gonna be, you know, before I get to who going, who all gonna be there. You know what I mean? Yeah. And It is a reminder to draw boundaries, not just in the, I drew a boundary in that moment, but I should have drawn it in a way where didn didn't have to experie, you're too important. Or at Least draw the, find the little end video box on the zoom right now. I'm outta here, Y'all. Yeah. Just consider facts.


Just consider others. Just consider, consider some others. You are, are well-spoken, well thought out, and professional enough to carry yourself well wherever you go. But when you consider others and content world, that clip did what it was supposed to do. Everybody posted it, everybody got theirs in the real world. When black people see it posted each time it's posted is a right. Yeah. It's another microaggression. Yeah. Trauma. No, that was macro. Yeah. That was fucking macro. It was a micro Yeah. The word. And it, and it pushes and it pushes the boundary even further because when we have somebody on TV like Pi Morgan who basically, you know, opens the door and gives this woman, woman permission dares her to call you that.


Right. And then she is looking like, she's like, oh, you don't have to dare me. I'm ready. Right. And you, and you stop it. The next program or you know, media outlet or whatever that wants to do that it's gonna happen. You know what I mean? And then it just gets That's a great Point too. Yeah. And, and listen, we all, we all got kids. We, we instill this in our children as to what it means to be a friend. And if you calling someone your friend who is encouraging you to do get on bullshit or do some bullshit or not live in your, then that ain't a friend. Yeah. I don't give a fuck about all this peer shit. If you, if this is where you'll go in the name of content while I'm present, I gotta just step back and reassess how I view some of this stuff.


It, it, it, and I had to do that in that moment. 'cause I, I, 'cause I don't think his biggest intent was to expose the race. I think his biggest intent was to make, get ratings and content. Not get a moment. I agree. He, it was a moment. And the fact that you would do that at my expense, whether you think black people are intellectually morally inferior or not, that's not the only way I assess people's racism. Yeah. You know what I mean? It is like, you're willing to let this happen to me. I gotta I that shit gotta mean. So listen past that. Sometimes white people don't know when they doing it. Yes. Yeah. And I think that was happening then too. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. You right. He might not have even seen that other POV that's there and ain't, he ain't able to. Especially he's British. It wasn't until I, but I was, 'cause when I said it, I, I know, I know Pi 'cause pi argues every point to the end.


But when I said that to him, he said I accept that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I was appreciative. Yeah. I actually, I had to, I hated everything up to that. But I appreciated that he at least stood down on it and that he didn't edit it out. Because the only reason in that moment, I said, 'cause people said, why are you so generous to him saying, I know you don't, that's not your intent. The only reason I said, I know this isn't your intent was not because I wanted to make him feel better. It was because I didn't want it to get edited out and I didn't want it. I didn't wanna be cut out of it. And if he, if he was held too accountable, he would've just cut the whole segment. Which would've, which I think would've done more harm to me than anybody else. So, but, but yeah. So I was trying to be strategic even in that moment. That's a lot of mental gymnastics. Yes. And I was like, I didn't want It is all for something I didn't even wanna do. Yeah. You know, so I'm curious, I mean this is just, you know, a a a speculative kind of question because you know, you're familiar with Candace and now you're familiar with Candace.


Yeah. If you hadn't been on the panel, 'cause you guys, you know, consider her the line and she'd been on the panel and this white woman had gleefully attempted to call her   what would her response have been? And again, this is speculation. Well, I Can't, I can't speak for anybody. I'm not gonna, yeah. I don't know. I'm not, I don I don't know that covers people going differently. 'cause Candace is a different person. But I don't know. I don I don really don't Know. I don't know what her stance on being called, you know, a nigga is, I think Most people kind of against it. I I also listen, regardless of what you think of Candace, I think she's extremely bright. I do too. I do too. I I am not gonna, you can take that away from her that she too is gonna be in a space where someone is comfortable openly calling her a   I just, I haven't seen that. So I'm not gonna assume. Don't think assume that that that is plausible.


I don I don't think she would. I think that's her lie. But I think's line too. I think she, with Myron, I don't think she'd be on, But what, what, what if it was the same circumstance in which she did not know who the panel was going to be up until the last minute. Kind of, you know, in the same situation that you Found yourself in. I can't what she would do, I don't know her well enough to assume what she would do. Okay. In that, in that instance. But I do know that if she felt compelled to leave, she would nothing. She, I think she operates on her principles even when I disagree with her. So I, I I think if she felt like, yo, this is some bullshit, she would've left if she felt that way. I don't know how she feels, but I think she would've left for sure. Lemme ask, she'd have got outta there like you did. How many times you been on Pierce? More times than I could count. Oh yeah. Have they ever pulled a move like this before? Whereas LA we like even when you asking yo who is, who's on the panel, who's on a panel. Oh It is almost like they're intentionally not telling you to track you.


It felt, it felt like that. But also sometimes don't sleep on other people recognizing your heat before you do too. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I think everything think about It is in play. Everything is in play. I'm thinking this is all at play. Like from the rip. That's interesting. I didn't think about that. That's a good point. I hadn't thought about it from that. Mark you on an absolute tear. Yeah. They See that and and the BBB It is B-B-B-B-C. I'm saying it Wrongest. I and they know when somebody's on tier. Yeah. They See that like they, they got hundreds of years of experience in recognizing when somebody's on tier and who better to be on a tier than our bro. Who, this is our guy right here so we could get it off on is he ain't gonna think nothing. That's like when the crime is going on and your informant is o over there.


Like, wait, what? It's an easy one. Yeah, that's true because I didn, I didn didn't think anything of it. That's how I look at that now you mentioned it was odd that they called me right Me because they almost never, that almost never happened. That looked like a play. Yeah. Yeah. Myron niggas have beat their dog shit outta you boy. Just so we clear. See I don't know who niggas are because it ain't me because I live a life of nonviolence. However, somebody, somewhere, nigga, we got something that boy must got Zoom, platinum, zoom Plus all his shit is on Zoom. If somebody ever catch you like face's not true, face the face's, it's not true.


They was just speaking outta a college. No, they go to colleges, they go to them. But what I'm saying is they go to them. But look what I'm saying is they traveling and this is where I shift the blame to the people. Like all that rage, bait and shit, we gotta stop falling for it yo. Yeah, because you build up like the who, what, what that word was that? I agree that, that Pearson, the, I don't know, some British network, whatever It is, they don't know this dude. No. They see traction. They see okay, his name is being here, here, here. Virality. That's what they look at. See dude. So now, okay, you're viral because of whatever, let's go get him. Yeah. And that's because now he can give us the moment.

But there's a lot of stories going around about how his little young hot girlfriend spoils business opportunities once you let her in the building. Oh okay. Those stories are going around.

He should have the ball but like his family, like they're like, you know like legacy. They should be concerned. Yeah. Yeah. And they're worried that like his co because the other concern is like your cognitive is slipping and this woman is taking, taking advantage of you. I'm not saying that's what's happening. I'm just saying like that's what the family's worried about. Yeah, for sure. You just gotta let that you got, it's his money, it's his life. You just gotta let him live it. I think it's terrible but like who cares ain. No, that's not how his goes. No that's not true. At at 65, 70, 75 years old. Your loved ones are not looking at you like it's your life. We gotta let you live it. No sir. No, you fucking up. I know you fucking up about money. Yeah, no sir. They and they think about right, they think about the money, the leg when they say legacy, like you fucking just cutting her into our shit mean shit. We seen fucking billions.


You, you cutting her into our shit. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's what the concern is. Same shit just happens on righteous G stove. Literally same shit. Yo. It's a little bit embarrassing too. Like if I was, if 30 years from now let's say my wife got hit by a bus and I, and I, okay my nigga what? Yo, where's the embarrassment? If 30 years short didn't look both ways shorty butted in, in an interview my nigga to protect him. No, no. I ain't talking about on that tip. I'm, I'm talking about like if 30 years from now I, I remarried and I'm 70 and I'm running around with a 20-year-old, my kids would be embarrassed. They, they would feel away about that. Oh shit. They'd be embarrassed. Mel's driving buses now. That was a good one. That was. I ain't gonna hold.


I ain't gonna hold you. That was a good one. Oh shit. That was a good one. You can erase it. I don't care. Don't laugh. Don't laugh. I'm just keeping the room on point. Don't laugh nigga. Yeah, you can't laugh. Yeah. No but seriously, I mean like my, I'm not saying they're right or wrong, I'm just saying like I young kids are embarrassed or they feel away when they, when they parents start dating young. Yeah. In my experience. That's all I'm saying. I think you should, the parents should able to do what they want. I just, but I Embarrassed the of Nicole Smith. What was that billionaire's name? She spent the next, I don't know what, 10 years in court fighting his kids who are like, I don have to be here at their Kids, be hating that shit. And they really be embarrassed. They want the money too. But they be embarrassed. She should have got paid. Agreed. She might have got paid something. I don't remember how it ended. It was like the 88 million. And then she got it and then she lost it And Nicole Smith should have got Yeah, that's what happened.


Went back. That's what happened. She lost The money. No, it was the courts, you know like they, they gave her the money and then the, then they took it back. The judgment was overturned and yeah, that's why she was in court for like 10 years. I think she ended up with something. And the fucked up thing is sometimes when the kids try to like say like you've lost your faculties so that they can justify like Conservatorship or something like that. Mental Dur conservative. They use the, the young date as the example of the evidence that you are under mental duress. Like look, he's running around a 20 year. He must be good. Yeah. But he is also I'm like head coach of I'm intentionally running around with that 20. Yeah. Oh I'm just saying. But that's what they trying to do. They gonna use it against them. They might use it against them. Are you guys as kids, hard argument. Are you guys as kids in a spot where they don't want a new sibling or they wouldn't mind one still?


My my my They want 'em. Yours is young. She still want 'em. Yeah, well they consider each other siblings but they all want another one. Yeah. But even that, when that first happened when we blended the family together, like they wanted a sibling and she wanted a sibling even though, no that's natural. But when the kid turns nine, 10 and 11 and they know that this new kid is cutting into they pie, their feelings start to change too. And they start right now. We, We good shit. My my my girl We good. It depends. Before that what what'd you say? Oh go ahead. It depends. Well of course it depends'. If you got enough dick that to spread around the pos, they don't know they lacking it.


Don't, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. Here's a trick question for y'all. Hold on, hold on. Let follow. Go ahead. It don't even be the, the the pie part. It is, It is the attention. Attention. That's where they get the, my girl was telling me like when she was having her second son, the the boy, he was the, the oldest one. He was just used to being the only boy and now there's another boy he hated him. Like just because a all that was me, all that attention I was getting as the boy is going to somebody else like his, they start that shit. I ace is right with the intention but I still wanna reply to Ish. What is that number? Well I don't know. 'cause some some, 'cause some kids will take the total opposite side of that. Some kids who want to be the big bro Big sis. Yeah. And shower the gifts and want to be the giver. Ami I got, you know what I'm saying?


Like, it, it it, I've seen it both ways. I'm seen it happen on both sides. What's your trick question? That was a trick question. Oh, that was the trick question. Yeah. What is the number I, I guess he said, what did he say? Just now my memory is bad but it happened to both ways. Two kids or enough. The trick question was, is what is enough? What does that look like? Depends on your life. What is enough for two kids number? It just depends on your lifestyle. Three kids depending on your lifestyle. Depends on the parent's lifestyle I think. I think when, when you have another child, a lot of of the attention deviates from the oldest one. That's it. It goes to the young, it goes to the younger one and and the oldest one in the moment fill the away you It is, you have more responsibility.


You have to help mommy me down. You have to do a lot of more things that you didn't have to do when there wasn't a child here. I woke up too early so I went down a rabbit hole and bumped into a TikTok baby mama suspense episode of Dateline. There's an influencer on TikTok who has a baby daddy who ain't shit. Absolutely he ain't shit. Oh. So she is detailing her experience with this kid with a baby daddy who ain't shit but she never mentions who the baby daddy is. She just says a gentleman from, let's make up somewhere from Philadelphia. A kind sir from Philadelphia now ba So she gets traffic.


She takes off a little bit. So what does dad do? You guessed it baby daddy. Baby daddy pops up. Of course he does. Baby daddy says yo bitches lying, yada yada yada yada. So now you've identified yourself. So now he starts getting traction. Come to find out he has six baby moms. This lady is one of six. How do we know that? Because baby mama number two, they liked some of the shit that she heard. Baby mama number two popped up with the smoke. Smoke for the for the other baby mama. For the dude. Everybody just with smoke. Gotcha. So then when baby mama number two started, baby mama number four started. Come to find out we now have TikTok confessionals Wow.


From all of the baby mamas. But this is where it gets juicy at some point. The baby mama who took off with the traction baby mama. Mama number six got a call from a baby mama we didn't know about. Mm. A new baby mama who says she's baby mama number six. So now we have bumped baby mama number six to baby Mama number seven. Seven. And TikTok is on absolute fire right now. I love TikTok. Wow. Wow. I absolutely love TikTok and I'm so glad that my girl lets me use her password except for that one time where we was arguing and I was on a TikTok and then it sent her an email and then she called me and said, look at you thirsty trying to find out why I am tracking me nigga anyway.

We call In the States my girl Yo. Oh yeah. Shit. Because It is going international. You did all that hoo nanny and I'm about to body it. That's the one that go to I'm about to kill it. Catch that shit. What? What?


I'm about to kill this shit. Y'all real quick before we go, I just want to circle back to our Met gala talk that you guys loved so much out there from us, but I saw ASAP Rocky getting a lot of flack. A lot of flack about what he wore and how some people expect him more 'cause he's that dude when it comes to fashion. I ended up bumping into one of them Instagram pages that that shows you all of the jewelry that everybody wore at the Met Gala. Be clear asap they were wrong. That little 20 carat umbrella with the diamond bottom and the diamond gun to symbolize the gun case that he just beat.


Oh. Which also symbolizes his love for his girl with her hits umbrella and diamonds. I'm slow. ASAP Chef's kiss to that fucking $20 trillion umbrella. One, two. I meant to say this last week. Wisdom not being invited to the Met Gala after what he did with that Burnt Rose look last year. Absolute disgrace wisdom. We can't wait to see what you do with the Dandy look on your platforms. That's the great thing about today. You don't have to wait for the powers to be to give you the opportunity. You could take it in your own hands.


Can't wait to see what you do. Hopefully you, you do it on your own. 'cause you know we wanna see you. Wisdom KK for y'all that don't know is one of the fastest growing fashion influencers out there right now. His Instagram absolutely kills it with the looks. We can't wait to see what you do with the Dandy shit wisdom. So speaking of doing it on your own, I meant to say that, speaking of doing it on your platform, doing it on your own platforms and stuff. I did see, I think it was Playboy, Cardi and his, his partner were going to the Met Gala and the way they beat it seemed like he got notified that he was banned at the last minute. So he took all his looks and just put the pictures out like they did like a photo shoot of their own and put 'em out. So it's like people still like, yo, we ain't here but I'm gonna show you the shit I had on.


Oh that's absolutely fire. Shout out to whoever had that quick eye to scratch his name off the list. I would've banned him too. You show up here with all that. He said that me said Meg. It said Meg did some recording in there that she wasn't supposed to do. Not supposed to record inside. Supposed record inside. Meg did some recording up inside. Stop. Hey I that's, that is Queen's Flip. Yes. Recording this with a Z. Apparently Meg, the stallion was recording in there and she wasn't supposed to. What's the, what's the, no you know what's the person who freeze? What's her name? No, no, no. I'm just, you're correct. Anna Winter. What her name Anna. Hi nigga. Yo, you cool? Hi helmet. You want, damn, you've been wanting to get a helmet shot off. Whoa, everybody, you going crazy?


That was nuts. Yeah man. What? What's her name man? Anna Winter you said yes? Yes. That's her rule. Like yes. No posting inside. No camera, no recording inside. But go ahead. That's all I was just, yeah, that's it. That's it. What mean she wouldn It is the rule. Hey ban her. Ban her. So they, they banned her? No, no, they need to, oh they're not ban banned. But there are some people calling for her to be banned because they want, I mean you can't break the rules. They want them to be consistent in the ruling. Ruling and apparently the same. Texas. Sorry my no. Sing a song. No I don, I like that. And apparently there are people that have been banned before for this. So they're looking to say, hey please be consistent. That's all. Got it.


Yeah, I watched the video. Meg, Meg taped it but shit, chef Kwame put some of that shit in the menu. You gotta put your phone down and tape it. I, I was listening that nigga she was taping. They said what this is curry curry balls of some shit. That shit's downing. Go ahead. When you going back there? Game let's go. Mel went without me. Oh yeah I didn't, that's my end s That's not your end boy. No, she's mine end. She's the first person that brought me to Tatiana. I am. I was, yes. Oh for real? Yep. Yeah, she's the very first person to tell me about it and bring me up there and introduce me to Chef Kwame. She introduced others.


She would throw shots earlier. Oh, oh, oh you introduced the niggas like that? I didn. That's what you meant. You introduced niggas. You match me. Oh you match me. Yo Joe. Yo. That's why we tried to fire you niggas shit like that. No, they said Mel was sending the shot when she missed the episode because the word was that I fired her or some shit. So she fired back by posting her at Tatiana. Oh shit. Oh shit. I'm just telling you what the word It is so imaginative though. You be doing slick shit like that. That's some slick shit. Fire and it's fire with the Drake suck a line in the music.
