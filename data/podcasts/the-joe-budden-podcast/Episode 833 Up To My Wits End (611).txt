Wayne is going on at nine. He's getting off stage at 10 30. They got a hard curfew. All of that shit. Right? It was 10 17. Nobody hit the stage yet. Oh shit. Dj. Damn. So anyway, I saw your tweet. Yo. Ain't that that union money too? I don't know. I don't know Probably, but, but anyway, for the, for The staff. The garden at The garden. Yeah. So already the crowd is a little tight. Yeah. I could see like, yo, what's going on? Gotta have a Walmart dj. He had, he had his, his his DJ was the opener, like, kind of like how Mustard opened for the Kendrick tour. You need another one. But Yeah, they had the house. They had the house catch up. Playlist playing. No, no, no, no. That's not it. It wasn't not in the garden.


It Wasn't it, it wasn't it at all. But anyway, Wayne comes out. He, he has a choir with him. Nice. Roman numeral six for the Carter six. Okay. Pretty dope. He gets into a couple early cuts off the album. Okay. Does the intro not mad we Right, right. Not, not mad. You Didn't do elephants? I don't even remember. I mean, I'm not gonna hold you like, I kind of checked out halfway through just because he sang most of the songs that he was rapping on. Like instead of rapping he sang them. Yeah. Yeah. Like, like did he have the guitar Harmon? He he came out with the guitar. He started with the guitar first.


Oh yeah, I did. So it wasn't, it wasn't the Wayne that I've seen. Like, because you've been on a way and It is been kicking it up. Absolutely. It wasn't bad. The song selection was good. I did like for New York. He did the, the, the Rock the Bells record. Okay. The Flip. Yeah. And he brought LL Cool J Out. Oh, that's fine. Who actually performed Rock the Bells. That's fine. That's good. So that was amazing. Over the original beat or Original beat. Okay. That was amazing. Fire. He brought Corey guns out for Millie. Shout to Corey. I'm sorry. Six foot, seven foot. Excuse me. Yeah. Alright. I'm go. That's dope. Today still speaking. He still signed to him. But, but yeah. Yo. But overall, like, I kind of walked out the show a little underwhelmed from the other Wayne shows that I've been to and seen.


Wait A second. Stop, Stop it. Stop. Stop, stop, stop. That's Our friend. That's my stop Doctor. Wait a second. Why is he still signed here? Yeah. He just put his new, the new Young Money roster up a couple. At What point as a artist do you need to walk into the corner office? 'cause you don't like the way things are going. What? If you like the way things are going, You, how could you possibly Yeah. Then that's the question. Yo, I ain't bullshitting around here. Hold Up. There could be a way where you could like things the way things are going. Yeah. Corey goes and Corey's an introvert. Yo, he's not dog. It guns does not like the way things are going. You Stop. I'm don't Don't, It is like when you don't, go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Some people aren't into making music and selling records.


Yeah. In some makes music. But some people, but some people, some People could do this And selling records. Yeah. Some people Just, and make money doing this. Yeah. They're just into making music. Yeah. We know. I So now you don't change it. Some people are just into making music. They don't care about being out there. Yo, that's y'all moving to Goal Post. I'm not moving up. I'm just saying. I think and we not Cory, we not starting with Corey got, yeah, of course not of course. But I dog stop. Shout out to Cory. Shout out to Cory. But anyway, show ended about 12 and I was just glad to get home. Any other special guest? It was, it just Cory Guns and L Cool. J That's it. Okay. Special. How did the crowd react to ll to the show? Oh, the show. It was a very white crowd, which is seems to be his new demo.


The guitars? Yeah. Guitars brings the whites out. They, they liked a lot of that. They liked a lot of that rock shit that he was doing. They loved it. Okay. You not so much? No, not so much. Oh man, I'm so glad I didn't go. Me too. Were you going to Yeah, I was in New York and I was going and I, I was literally gonna say, well, let me just head over there. But I thought the show started at eight and Didn didn't wanna miss too much. Then I saw his tweet that said at 10 17, it hadn't started yet. And I was like, I'm not going over there to wait another hour. I wasn't sure he was gonna show up or it was gonna be some Laury Hill shit where it starts at midnight. So I just, I just kept it going. I should've, I should've known something because like I, the people that came that was sitting next to me, they was like, did you just get these tickets? I'm like, no. He was like, yo, I just bought these tickets like an hour Ago. Well, that's what I was about.


They were literally, I got, I was getting hit up by like all the secondhand ticket people. Like still Little Wayne tickets available? No, at like Eight 30. It wasn't even second hand. Oh. Like Ticketmaster. Ticketmaster Had blue seats available. Good Ones. Wayne, Texas. These freezer wasn't packed. Girl, girl Scout cookies. It was packed. But I think a lot of people bought very last minute tickets. Yeah. Got it. Price's. No, they was discounted. Were Packed. Yeah. Yeah. But anyway, shout to everybody, you know, he is on tour, so we'll see how that goes. Hope It keeps getting better. It was first night, so I'm not holding too much against you. You gotta tweak your, make your little tweaks as the tour goes along.


Mm. Mark how was the play? It was amazing. It was amazing. Othello, me and my wife went to see Othello on Friday for her birthday. Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday. Happy birthday. Happy birthday baby. Love you. Did you say it? I did Say happy birthday. Make it loud. I'm black and I'm proud. Not about me. That's true. Carry on. And I got to see Denzel. It was the last weekend of it. He, we saw Friday. I think his last date was that Sunday. So I wanted to make sure we saw it. He was great. Jake Jeral was great. I mean, it was an amazing performer. All the whole cast was great. It was, it was just a great play. I'm not a big Shakespeare person.


That's not really my bag. But they made it, like Mel was saying before, they, they made it more modern and more accessible, so, okay. It was, it was, it was super, super good. Great play. It wasn't speaking d and th and all That. There was some D and ths, but it was a lot less of it. And it was a lot of modern. The it was modern gesticulation. There you go. That's ge. And is that all, is that all sir? Modern Gesticulation. I'm Fine. Hold on. Hang guys. Is that all? What do you mean? Hold on, I'll let them finish. I wanna, I wanna hop the, the, the word gesture is Oh, okay. Okay. Got it. I'll let them finish. I, I, Oh yeah, yeah. We gonna wait. I'm with Flip. Yeah. I'm gonna hyperfocus on you because I was on Reddit. Yeah. Is that all? Yeah, Reddit. Reddit showed your wife's dialogue when she got home own.


Oh, that was, that was backstage though. That was backstage. Oh, it was still backstage. You trying to say nigga house look big like that nigga? He ain't, nah, don't shit out. Don't big nigga. Alright. You doing too much now's. I'm sorry. I'm done. Not yet. Not yet. That's next deal. Next deal. Yeah. We got some space to clear. No, I, my wife once loves Denzel Washington. That's like her all time favorite. Who doesn't love Denzel. Exactly. Amazing person. And she said, this is the one person I've always wanted to meet. And she doesn't like to meet famous people. Whenever I try to get her to meet famous people or say hello or take, she's like, I'm from Jersey. We don't do that. Which she's right. She, I didn not understand is right. I thought that was We don't do that. Y'all don't do that. No, that's right. You see how Ish act. He don't wanna say how this cousin, his damn nigga won't say how the guess when they, so, but she was like, I would like to meet Denzel.


And the problem is, when you're even moderately, like I said before, a a luxury once enjoyed becomes a necessity. So now it's like, oh, well hopefully we get to meet Denzel, which means I really expect meet Denzel, make that happen. Make it happen. So I'm like, I don't know. Nobody that knows Denzel. There's different levels of fame and Denzel's another stratosphere. So I don't even know. Nobody could get to meet Denzel. So first person I called on the way there was Mel. Mm. I was like, can't help you Motherfucker. Lemme be clear. That wasn't the first person. I went through my list and on the way You couldn't help. No, I was like, Mel was there. So I thought maybe And you, I thought you had to hook up for, for Denzel. She, she, she's put down, she's only put down because you had to hook up for Denzel, right? Yeah. But it kind of works being in there.


So not since he got backwards. So not since he got saved. Exactly. I call. So, so I was like, I'm kind, I don't know. I gonna make this you on a block list. Leave the worldly things world, that name better not firing brimstone. Yeah. So I was like, I don't know what I'm gonna do. So then I was like, I'm lemme just go buy some tickets really close to the stage. I was like, so if She ain don't, She ain't gonna meet Denzel tonight, but at the very least she gonna be close to 'em. So I got like third, fourth row them tickets is expensive, even like hell yes, they were. And I had, I got, oh, like you bought 'em day off. I bought 'em, I bought 'em two, like a day and a half before. Okay. Same thing, same shit. But it, it was crazy for orchestra center, right?


Yeah. So I was like, I'm just gonna have to hope that we can, that he See that he sees me and knows who I am. Hey, two, two big ifs. Yeah. Doesn't happen. So I get in there, I'm looking around, I'm like, couple people spoke to me. I was like, maybe there's a famous person who I know who's going backstage. I don't see anybody. Then the two comedian, r Ahmed, the, the actor and Hassan Minhaj there at intermission. I know them pretty well. He's Ed was there. Yeah. Sorry. Okay. I think he's single. Okay. Oh, then don't tell her. He just did. There's no challenge. Right? He just did. So I was like, maybe at the end of the show, if they go backstage, I'll just go with them because I'm like, I'm gonna make this happen for my wife. Right.


'cause I don't want her, I want her birthday to be good. So the show ends and they're far away. And I'm not thirsty, so I'm not gonna yell across the other room because they, they're at the stage door, like they're about to go. But I ain't wanna be like, yo, wait for, because It is, yeah. You can't do that because it's a ask and a yell at the same time. You from Jersey now? Yeah. We won't do that. We ain't never did that in Philly. So I just let it go. I'm like, I'm stuck. I'm walking up the aisle. I see this brother with a, a old head with like a pinstripe suit on. He gives me a, a handshake. He's a, he's my frat. Right. So he throws up the yo and says, yo, what's going on? Nice to meet you. I see you, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I was like, oh, good to meet you, bro. Like, what you up to? He was like, oh, I'm just going see my man DI was like, oh, this might work.


But Wow. But niggas say that and be, and it'd be, it'd be bullshit. Yeah. So I was like, I, so I kind of ignored it. Went to the front, came back. Now everybody's out the theater. I'm trying to walk back to security hope and security recognizes me and just lets me back. He looked like he was about to taser me. So I was like, he doesn't know who I am. I walked back out to leave and I see my frat brother again. He says, I said, what you about to do? Well, can you pause for a second? I do want to just highlight that Mark think he famous enough that's somebody about to see him and be like, oh, come in with Denzel. I see Martin, I see Morgan rain down on him streets. I'm trying possible you wasn't downstairs. And I feel Like that's where his story's going. You wasn't downstairs though.


What It is, Joe? I believe it. I'm not that famous, but there's a lesson. Stop that though. But there's a lesson that I learned. Jesse Jackson told me this. He said, if you just walk, like that's where you're supposed to be. That's a fact. True. That's a fact. That is a fact. That's true. True. And and I'm just noticeable enough that like he look kind of familiar and he walking like he's supposed to be here. I'm not. I don't wanna be the nigga to stop somebody important. That's usually, that's the vibe. That's Denzel's son. It could be. Right? Yeah. So I'm sitting there. He said, we just waiting for Denzel. We'll just, we'll just, I was like, all right. I was like, can I go back with y'all? He was like, you gotta check with his security. The security comes over, shakes my hand, says, I love the pod. Mm. There you go. Love Joe Button podcast. He said, but I wanna collect, I wanna correct something.


Oh. Oh. He said, I didn't let Mel back because I knew her. I let her back because I knew her friend Kelly. This, for some reason was important that he wanted to know. I don't know why. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Oh, come on. Am I, I'm just, wait, what the fuck? This is the, this is what he told me. No outta nowhere. Hmm. Un wrote Ish. That beverage ain't that good. What's what? No, he didn't, he wasn't dissing you. He was just saying like, I don I don't know why he needed me to know this. I literally said that up here, here Crack. I, I'm, I Literally said that up Here.


We cracked jokes up here and saying that she knew the security. So we did that and overshadowed what she was saying. I think you said that. I think you said that to defend you A thousand percent. Right? Like Mel, what? He's not revealing anything. I heard some stories about the Mel remix said that I, I've heard some stories out here about the memory. Now, usually she don't do this, but he MI think he, I think he was saying like, Mel wasn't doing nothing out of pocket. It was actually a friend who led it like that. I think he was defending you. He wasn't saying like it did. Probably he was, but I'm just immature. So You are. You all are. So anyway, so I'm sitting there waiting now and I'm like, all right. I hope, didn't they let me back 10 seconds later, Denzel, we still in the middle of the theater. Denzel just comes out wearing sweats in a black t-shirt and just sits down and just starts talking to everybody.


Right at that same moment, chance the rapper walks in. Right. And you know, chance knows Denzel. He does not. We had not. He sits down directly. Next, I don think you understand how famous Denzel Washington is. He sits down next to him. He's talking for about 10 minutes. He's so famous. He doesn't even see anybody in the room. But the people he already knows about 10 minutes after talking, he's telling stories. He's charming us. He's laughing. He's making fun of his own performance. Even though it was great. He's doing all the things, making small talk, just the cool, every bit as cool as you would expect him to be. Then he says, oh, so who else you got here? So he turns around and he, and he looks at chance and goes, Hey Denzel. Who, who are you? He says, I'm Chance the rapper. He says, are, are you famous? Chance says like, you know, he is being cool.


You know what I mean? And then he goes around the room, speaks to other people. Chance is so cool. I love Chance. It is my brother. Right? Then he looks at me and says, and and Who are you my man? He said, you on tv, right? I was about to say, I feel like Denzel would know Mark Well, I was banking on that. I was like, this whole plan, my whole plan the whole time was that he would know who I was and be cool. Yeah. He goes, my man, he said, you on tv? I said, yeah. He said, what do you do? I said, I just say CNN 'cause it's the easiest thing, right? I said, CNN. He said, that's right. Blah, blah, blah. Now we're cool. We talking, joking, whatever. Then Denzel says, well, I gotta go out and talk to the people. I, I, I gotta say hello. I'll be back because I still haven't got my wife's picture. He turns to chance again and says, how famous are you?


Chance goes, oh my God. Chance goes pretty famous. And he says, come with me. We gonna find out. They, oh shit, fire. They walk in the hallway, they go down the hallway, kick open the door to Broadway. There's a thousand people standing outside, and as soon the door open, they're cheering, they're screaming, the flashbulbs popping and shit. He pulls Chance up onto the, onto like the, the lift on the SUV and, and they just both start waving to the crowd. The crowd's like Chad and he brings him back in. It was like, he was like, Oh yeah, you, you kind of famous. You right? Yeah. You, that's check word. It was the Wild by Denzel and he wasn't, there was no arrogance to, it was like, I just, I'm just somebody else.


I'm different. I'm from a different planet. Yes. I don't know none of this. And I'm, and I'm older. Yeah. So, and then Chance sat down and then I finally got my picture and I don't care. Right. That part two, and I don't care about part two. He don't be giving a fuck. Yeah. He was like, so then my wife finally got the picture. Right. My wife had to set the Instagram so I couldn't take like, multiple pictures. You'd be shocked to know I didn't take a good picture. She was looking. We never do. No, no. Yeah. But this was like, husbands are the worst. We are the worst. We're the worst. But imagine like, especially when she liked the guy. And I'm thinking up you in this motherfucker. Right? It might have been you and the security guy. You right.


You didn't know how to close out an Instagram and just go to camera. I don't, the girls like the photos though. Washington is standing there. Remember Denzel was standing there having to go back out to, is the thousand people waiting? I had four seconds. Okay. She looked at it, looked at me. And if, if anybody in a relationship, you understand, no matter how much you do for your partner, let me say that. I think the gentleman will agree with me. Come on. Come on Pastor. You're only as good as the last part of your favor. Right? That's a fact. Totally forgot. Pass the plate around. So $5,000 for the tickets. Don't matter. Denzel Washington Don't matter.

I said, you shouldn't at least warn niggas. He said flip. No, this is not what It is. I said Okay. Had a call. I was at the gas station shaking my what Saturday? Yeah I read it. I said Niggas having meetings with niggas that trying to surprise us. Listen, we have to a lot happening. Start this show. There was a lot happening. Yeah. We have to start this show. Let's do it. BET awards. BET awards. I'm on bullshit. So if y'all want to, if Mel or Mark would like to start this in a more mature manner, we need that. Y'all could go for it. Okay. I'm not able to do that. Alright. Well it was the celebrating the 25th anniversary of the BET awards.


Yes. And so they decided to hit shit off with a whole bunch of nostalgia. They created a 1 0 6 and Parks mini stage. They had all the hosts come. Well Roxy was missing and AJ was missing probably because of prior engagement. But Free was there, was there, stop it. Tig was there. So it was, it was. And then you know there was the it mish mosh of you know, artists and shit like that. Do we believe that? Lemme just jump in. Yeah. Do we believe that both AJ and Roxy had prior engagement so they weren't unable to make it? I can't speak for aj but they both posted on it. Yeah, I started post. Yeah. AJ said he tried to make it happen. Couldn't Roxy said the same thing.


I know Roxy a little bit better. I know Roxy a lot better. That's my sister. Same, I believe. I believe Roxy. I just don't know AJ to know one way or the other. A thousand percent. Same Educated bro. What? Yo. Alright, just for future reference, that's how many sisters you got? A lot sisters. I got a decent number of sisters, but Roxy's really, I mean we worked together. You know I was a political correspondent for 1 0 6 and Park for years. So I was hell Ish. We gonna let him. Alright, go ahead. Alright, keep, let's just keep this I got good relationship. Alright, so yeah, so Roxy posted, they both posted, yada, yada, yada. All right. So, but it was still, it was still, I thought it was a dope event. Obviously I'm biased but you know, I, I thought BET put on what I thought was maybe the best award show from them I've seen in over a decade, maybe 15 years.


Shout out to Kanye Orlando for making it happen. Jesse, everybody who made it happen. I thought it was good mix of music. Nostalgia message. There was everything. The skits, I thought, I thought it was just well balanced. It was long. A little too long a performance for me for my age. Like it Was like was five hours Long as show. It was like Five hours by 1145. I was like, all right dog, I'm trying but I'm going to bed. That Shit went off. Watched the rest in was Yeah, I watched the rest in the morning. I was like, I can't watch the rest. But it, I thought it was amazing though. I think Kevin Hart did an amazing job on hosted. He killed it. He absolutely killed it from top to bottom. Pause Prime off. But what'd you think of the, the, the, the first montage of, of artists starts off with Ashanti.


So Maya came out a Marie Jim Jones. I know Jim Jones a Marie. I was actually kind of surprised that they didn't have Ashanti and Ja rule 'cause it would just would've been like Prior Engagements I'm sure. Alright. People would be busy. Okay. Well They, I think they got it right Or even or even Nelly or Joe button. No, they got it right. I think They got it right. I definitely should have got a call. I don't know what happened. I don They didn't even call you? No. Would you have went, did you check your Spin before They wouldn't have went. Everybody went to the spin. Ain't Nobody calling Joe probably went to the spin. Them Niggas are tired of calling Joe. He says no a lot. Jason is not. Yeah. Okay. But if I'd have known that that's how they was giving it up, I might have dusted off.


Dusted off and watching the awards last night and the pre-award show. I See that vests are coming back in LA Yo saw, I saw a lot of niggas with they arms out in chess out. I almost went to the closet. Please Don't Invest are coming back. No we don't. No they're not. Yo. I dust one of the best off and come do pump it up. I didn't know y'all was giving it up like that. But I absolutely love the whole 1 0 6 and park background. I loved all of the nostalgic performances. Fucking Bow Wow. Is still one of the best performers. Yo. Yeah, he turned up. He turned up. He is. He is am Omarion is my man friend of the show and friend of Joe.


But I forgot that that was his group mate that was running around with his baby mama all that time. You would never see another B 2K dollar if it were me buddy saying, well He kicked him off the tour at, remember when it first happened? Yeah, but he stopped his bread for a minute. The PSC and G don't stop coming. He stopped his bread for a minute. Yeah, But then he insurance. Yeah, they they killed it though. Fuck that I don't care about. I don't care that they killed it. I care that he was back standing next to this nigga after all that running around He did with his baby mama. I'm not here to give proper music takes. I'm here to give takes about shit. That really ain't none of my business.


Niggas could have squashed it. Whatever. So Don't, I cannot believe he was up here hitting a shimmy with that nigga. That's the first thing I said with on four Snap him my mistake. Like they used to do at the Jackson five in the seventies. Them niggas will be back there. Bow fucking you up nigga. You can't do that with my baby mom. And then I'm hitting bump bump with you. Yeah. Nah, It's gonna be bump bump. It is gonna be a whole different bump. Whole different bump. It pains me that bad. Wow. Has to do that song without Sierra. Yeah, I thought that. Yeah. Yeah. And what was funny was Fizz was rapping Diddy part and I noticed that.

That was just my mind going into another world. But I said, why is he he rap Diddy part Lil Maya. Look, Maya looks spectacular. Maya. She don't age amazing. Ashanti looked great as well.

BET awards the tribute, oh, go ahead. No, I'm say the, the four, the big icon awards. That was another sign that this was a major BET event. I mean, Mariah Carey. Yeah, they, they, yeah. They emptied out the clip. That's what I'm saying. Yo Mariah, first of all, Mariah Carey coming to a, an award show period is, is a big deal these days. But coming to the BET awards and as she said, 'cause Mariah always guys throw a little shade. Of course her first BET award. Oh yeah, yeah. You know, which is crazy by the way. Yeah. That was my first sign that they, they opened the checkbook up. Yes. Yeah. Nick, Nick Cannon told us for Mariah to walk out the house how much It is. Yeah, yeah, they did. So I was like, oh shit, she's Here. And that is what she did. She walked out the house.


Well they, they, they helped Her walk out the house. They helped listen, they help Mariah. They said Mariah about to perform my girl. I'm sitting there. I do love watching like award shows and shits with like your girl. That's the best, what's the best shit ever fire because you got your nigga brain and you got her brain. Her brain. Yep. And y'all both stupid. So. Yep. And first y'all getting along again. Oh that's bonding That bullshit. What about That? Oh, we still love each other shit on. So anyway, so my girl was like, alright, I can't wait to see Mariah come out with the long dress and homeboy walk her to the front. You know, that's a Mariah staple. I was like, yeah girl.


But in my head I was like, I don't know. Did that last table It is. So she comes out sure enough long shit to the bottom of the thing homeboy walking her down the thing Jigy not suss one, Hey, we'll get with suss one at the after party. It is time to make the money. Gimme one of these muscle bound naked niggas who walk me to the front. So as you walk to the front, she got a new song with, again classic hiphop blend with Mariah. Yeah, it sounds, I like the song. Brought Rock Kim out that was fire brought Rock Kim out. He sounded good too. If the young people didn't know who Wale was, they had no idea who Rock Kim was. Probably true. Now I was hyped and I, I love when people do maroon and red or brown and red or whatever he did in red.


I just picked that fire with old gangster suit too. Yeah. Yeah. He, he looked great. But my, I heard I did Mariah talk a lot of the people that performed, I'm not sure that they said a word Sh during her performance or her speech because the speech during performance speech was also Very true during, oh, I went to bed. By then I'm talking about, I'm talking about during the performance. I don't think she talked. No, I don't think so. I just kept hearing TV tracks and recorded vocals. Yeah. But it's fine. She looked great to go dress. She Mariah everything fire Mariah could do, what the fuck she wants. Pretty much Mariah coming out told me they spent a lot of money. But that wasn't the first time I thought it. The first time. I thought it was when the racist dove commercials hit.


I don't know about y'all. Y'all was watching the awards. I was watching everything else. Yeah. Yeah. Now I've seen a lot of Dove commercials and I use Dove. I've I've never felt seen watching them. It is normally mad white people doing white shit in the Dove commercial nigga I looked up, they had girls with Afros. Oh, mad Black. They had the Shea butter joint. Yes. This was a whole, yeah, it was like a whole crew of Ari Lennox's. So I'm at the edge of my seat waiting to see what brand this is doing this shit They're talking about, duh yo.


I almost started crying. I said, baby, I think this is some racist shit. They did a whole P, Proctor and Gamble. PGP and G segment. P and P and G. That's dope. Swiffer Jets. All that's Fire. Wait, hold up. Well hold up. Walmart. Everything came with an ads. I'm not bad at it. Neither award was presented. No, No Walmart. Did it show? No, everybody show. No, no. Everybody do ads. It is 20, 25. Everybody in the world your your least favorite podcast is doing ads. Joe's Boxers. It's the type of ad p and g, dove, Walmart, Kevin, Kevin Hart opens the show talking about these fucking autonomous cars parked outside.


I'm like, yo, these niggas been racking it up and your man took all the DEI money away. So now we gotta kind of try to get back in the good graces of the Negros. So we're gonna get BET some money, nigga. What you talking about? Oh wait, they had Toyota? Yeah, McDonald's. Listen, they only gave out four awards. If they didn't have an ad to sponsor the award, bitch you wasn't getting an award. So that's when else I knew some funny shit was going on. They pull up First Award. Alright, best girls in the game. Stupid. Yo, everybody It is 20.


Any girl, everybody they put put all the girls in there. I was like, damn. They still read nominees? No, that's the thing. 20 nominees, 10 nominees a pop. We not gonna miss nobody. They say Cardi B, Nick Benina, fucking Doja cat. Anybody that had a pussy, they put in this first award show. Yeah, they did. So now my girl is using Fanfare Brain. Ooh. I think I just thought she was gonna win. I'm using Advanced Music Brain over here, nigga. I batted a thousand last night. I'm like, oh, got that Doce. Yep. She's like, why? I said, well, It is Doce one, two. She's in the front. She's here. Yeah, right there. She's in the front. Well, Glo was in the front too when You Right in front.


Yeah. The people in the front let you know. Oh yeah. You know what time It is. The Lang spoken back to Mark's Denzel story. When it, when it's award time, it's a very clear indicator of how famous everyone is. When you get to the award show and we'll talk about Wale and Kai later, that's gonna be a good way for you to learn the people that know you and fuck with you and like what you're doing. And the people that do not have any type of clue who the fuck you are. Doce was in front. So I thought that she was getting it. Sure enough, she got it. The very next award, ladies speech by the way, I wanted like that. Oh, let's start there. Yeah. She killed the la Amazing Speech, man.


Yeah, that's using, using Your Moment. It was all over activist Twitter. When I woke up this morning, it was all the stories, all the, you know her criticizing the US H Reporter? Yep. It was everywhere. Talking about ice, talking about free speech, talking about the government crackdowns. It's Palestine, everything. S all of it. I mean, that's a bullshit to do, period. But especially on an award show. 'cause that can get you shut down. So shout out to her. I was really, really impressed by her. Well, pardon me? My father called me this morning to curse me out and he started with Yo, whoever the first young lady was. The speech that she gave was phenomenal. Talking about what they had to deal with outside with Trump sending, sending military, military people to break up peaceful pro protests. Cool. He said, how could you start an award show with that and then Honor Snoop in the same year that he went and did that shit with Trump.


He said, black people are too forgiving. Black people are too welcoming and it's either get down or lay down. He says, you either support what he got going on and the people that supported that. Or you fuck with what the young lady said at the front. Now he was yelling at me like I was Snoop. If you know my dad, he's on some super, like we ain't gotta talk about it. Pop Pop is always, but I thought that that was pretty interesting. He ain't wrong. I can't say that he's wrong. He's not. Nah, he's up. I don't know if I, I I didn't think about that. But yeah, honor him next year. Yeah. I mean I think it was too late at that point.


It was way too late. I mean, it had been kind of like advertised that Snoop was going to be getting this award. So there's no way to When did they start advertising it though? Huh? When did they start Advertising it? No, I mean just in terms of like the, like people knew who he was, who was going to be accepting awards like during the whole weekend. The Icon Awards. Yeah, exactly. So it was not like, it wasn't like a secret that was being kept with you. I thought it was a little odd to do four icon awards. And that's, yeah, it's usually like a one person gets it per show called One person gets one award, another person gets a different award. Yeah. But they kind of are both Icon. Think you said they The clip. Yeah. That's that's literally what it was. Ed the clip. I looked at it. Yep. One everything a big bang. We getting everybody. Yep. Yeah, because they're very different people.


Yep. And we covering all, all demos, But still that's toward the end. I kind of want to go in order. Wayne comes out to perform with the choir that you spoke about earlier. Yeah. The choir with in front of the album cover. And he started with one of the earlier tracks off the new album. Did The first song. Yeah. The intro and the sec. Well, the intro beat and then the second song For me. He got outta that right when he needed to get out. He did. Mm he did. Yeah. And, and and got to the hits. Yeah. Got to got to Milli hit. Yeah. Quick. Yeah. So shout out, shout out to him. But yeah, we not here for the new shit. We not. What else happened after that? Let's see, let's see. Doce Sizzle, Leon Thomas Win.

Scissor, Victoria, ma, name, money, law, anybody you can name is in the next one. And I guess I'm right. Scissor my girl Wrong again. I didn't, I didn't expect Ssar to win that because I didn't think she was there. Yeah. She didn't get up to accept it. But then she wasn't, she was There. She wasn't, She wasn't there yet. She wasn't there yet. Yeah, she wasn't there. That was the next sign that told me. Oh, okay. We know what time It is tonight. She's not coming for the early award.


I'm coming with Top and Kendrick with the crew. With gang. Yeah, with with the crew. Yeah. Late, late. And then later in the show, I saw Kendrick in the crowd early with that brown outfit. I paused. It had to rewind. And I was like, Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah. Sewed Up. Anyway, what else? What else, what else, what else? See, I didn't even see him earlier. Didn didn't see him until he won the award. I was like, oh shit. He was, Oh yeah, I see what's happening. They called in. Everything was like, we got them all here. Yeah. That's how they got all that advertising. And that might be why they got all them. I had all the icons. We gonna bring every marketing dollar we gonna pitch. We got Mariah, we got Snoop got. It's the 25th year though. You know what I mean? They swing it for the fences and we gonna, but I absolutely loved it being for the established older acts for the most Part.


True. Yeah. I agree. I think that's what you need too, to get those people In there. Enough of you. Little lean heads. Well, they did it for themselves. Enough of you. Little drunk fuck Tars. Yeah, They gave, they gave 'em Kai and they gave him Playboy. Kai. They gave him Cardi. They gave, I don't put them, I don't put them in the class I'm talking about, but Yes they did. I'm talking about the Artists. Even way, even the way they did that though, because you have the BET awards itself on television the whole time. Druke and Kai was on a stream, a live stream, the entire show. Yeah. I love that. So for those who are into the streamers who don't really watch tv, we got a whole nother show for y'all over here. And they were into like, I I, you know, I checked it out a couple times.


We bugging the fuck out. We gonna meet y'all. Where y'all at? Yeah, we gonna meet y'all. Where y'all at? So those of us who wanna watch, who still watch tv, us old heads, we didn't wanna see none of that young shit. That that wasn't the show that we wanted. And and it was in Vice market to both Vice. Yeah. They smoked that shit. Smart, Very smart. Lot of research went into this. They, anybody didn't have any thoughts on Cam Newton's announcement about 1 0 6 in sports? Absolute. Yeah. Yeah. I hope it works. Oh yeah. Kind of hit like a dud. Not a lot of people were thinking swinging pretty well. Yeah, kind of. Everyone was like swinging a miss. They looked at it like they were like, so you didn't think to do a reboot of 1 0 6 in Park, but you're giving us 1 0 6 in sports, almost like trying to revive mad sports. Remember that?


Yeah. Yeah. They're trying to tap into different markets. I'm not mad. We'll see how, How It ends up. I've just, yeah, I'll, I'll keep my thoughts to myself, but I'll I'll just say I hope it works. I hope they invest in it. I hope they make it happen. 'cause I I Cam deserves the show. BET deserves to have another hit. I hope it works out. Although I'm, I was still looking for the 1 0 6 in Park reboot. Although I don't know how you do that in this era. I was gonna say, I don't think that would ever be successful today. Yeah, I think you're right. A 1 0 6 Park. I mean with the stream, if it was a streaming thing with certain streamers, it would. I think it could Work. Yeah, it could work. They have to, they just have to go younger. What happens is with the long form. Exactly. We are not watching that. The younger people are watching long form content, But 1 0 6 Park was based around music. Videos. Videos Of course. So what happens is music, the music label, the music labels are not even debuting a video with you.


Yeah, that's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. You're not gonna have a video show. But they I think they could make it work though, Joe. I think they could. There's still a lot of videos. There's more pride, more videos now that ever was. Okay. I don't know if It is a cache. Like we people Go home, nobody's coming home to watch it. Video. Yeah, Usually video. Go home bro. When a new Video playing. But then you may tune in for your favorite streamer to debut that, if you understand what I'm saying. I think it could work. You have to be able to play it. I hope. I hope. Look, I wish number. But look, Another tribute was the Quin, I'm sorry, the Quincy Jones tribute to y'all out there. Y'all, y'all could skip Secret Garden when y'all in the war room coming up with ways to honor Quincy Jones. Please God do that because Lucky Day came out.

I can take you this real quick. And, and as we walking up the beach, I was trying to get on umbrella because it was hot and he's jumping and he's falling behind me and jumping and falling. So I'm about to scoop him up and take him to the beach. And he says to me something that shocked me. He said, look, Papa, I'm walking in your footsteps. Said, and that's where I carried you. Tyler Perry. He that's it. Tyler Perry. And it was then I carried you. Let's, it's only one set of footprints. Papa Tyler Perry. That's I'm carrying you. Mr. Perry Tyler. That nigga is making himself Jesus choke Tyler Perry. Yo, my brother. If anybody out there knows Tyler Perry, tell him that all of us up here said that just didn't happen.


Yo, that just did not happen up. Yo bullshit. You know what Tyler Perry speeches remind me of. Now it's like when loaded Lux first did the Calico third round and it worked. So then after that, everybody tried to do their version of that. Like Tyler Perry, when he did the speech about the plantation, the the plantation and the naval base. And I purchased this and we used to live over here. But, and even though that was well choreographed and well written too, we let it. Right. Because that was, you can't disagree with what he's saying. It is phenomenal. It's monumental. It's like go black, black, black, black, black, black, black.


But you only get one the first time. You only get one the first time. Now you're trying to draw water and say, well he is dragging this and you're not that good of a person. You're not. That's my problem with these niggas. But anyway, this story didn't happen. No, no. I've been on the beach with a kid when it's too hot. That ain't what they doing. That ain't what three year olds doing. That's not what they doing. They don't turn to my dad. Don't they doing footstep Indic steps. Agree. That just doesn't happen. No. My three year be eating the fucking sand. Yes. What the fuck are you talking about?


My 3-year-old be about to drown. Right. Fuck. Holy shit. But he think we are complete idiots now. He killed the Yeah, he killed me. He killed it. And he killed me. He ended, Hey, hey, hey, hey. Let metaphoric hey. He continues. It touched my heart. So I grabbed him by his hand And I said, no, let's walk together. We walked to the end of the beach and then he looked back and he saw all the footprints that he had left. I said that to you tonight because I want to talk to you about this thing that is happening in this country. And I want you to pay attention to it. Don't miss this. They shout already. They're removing our books from libraries. Okay. They're removing our stories and our history.


They are removing our names from government buildings is as if someone wants to erase our footprints. Mm. So you know what I do give you divorce sisters. That's what I was thinking when he was talking. If all that's true, why the fuck are you making Madea goes to jail. No's destination. You right. Fuck are we talking about? Why don't you make a movie about that shit and make sure he a crook and then we can't say nothing about it. 'cause he booked Simba. Yeah, he did. He did. He did. We can't say nothing about it. 'cause he, he paid, he paid fucking one of them. Elvin from the most money that ever made.


And they fucking Elvin from the Cosbys and all. Yeah. And to Rogers. You gave Oh Sicily. Tyson gave Sicily. Tyson a million dollars. Tyson gave it a mill. So we can't say nothing. 'cause of course we feel that. Right. But we just not sticky. I don't feel you nigga. I'm not going to lie to you. I like Tyler Perry a little bit. I like his work, his movies. I like him. He a type think it's cool. I I love what he does. I just feel like sometimes he dangles people in front of us. Like, I bought this person a car. I did this thing. So that it's harder to have a, a criticism of him. And, and that's the thing I don't like because I like his movies. I find him entertaining. But I just, I just think there's a lane for that. But there has to be a lane to say, yo Tyler, you could do better. And he don't do better no more. He don't even try to do Why you look at me like that? I I watch the movies. So I'm I'm part of the problem.


You like that? I do. It is what yo my yo I grew up watching stage plays though. I, I, I like it for what they are. I Love Madea on when on stage the plays. Yeah. The plays are amazing. Yeah.

And I'm And we'll be done.


We'll be done. We promise. Wale was on our Patreon episode. Shout to Wale. Shout to shout to Wale and spoke about the tough time that he has had at award shows. The trauma that is attached to attending some of these award shows because of how you're treated and the disconnect between streamers today and hip hop. He spoke about all of these things that Came right to Fruition and then took his ass right to the BET awards. Yeah. Now I'm not mad at 'em. If you got a project coming and you making your runs, the BET awards is probably where It is where they tell you you need to be.


Absolutely speaking for me and me only, I've had enough horrible experiences at award shows to, I didn't, toward the end of my career, I didn't give a fuck. If I had an album coming, I would've been Tight. I'm not doing it. I'm sitting there for 6, 7, 8 hours with no food or drinks. I'm not doing it. Yeah. What? No food. No drinks. Not the best spot. Not the best spot. When paparazzi is trying to catch you, you like the fucking fifth, fifth hundred person. Right? Right. As the war's about to start, all the paparazzi's running inside you trying to hit your poles. Anyway, Wale was walking somewhere, bumped in the ssat sac. Said what up? And Wale was like, yo man, what up, yada yada, yada. And then Constant Na got in the vehicle. I I should play it.


Yeah. And then Constant Na got in the vehicle. Yeah. And his audience told him, yo man, that was Wally Shit. And then Kai was like, oh shit, that was somebody big. Oh that was Wally. Oh God. Which told me we were in for a night. WALE being Wally Wale is my man. He was just here. I love him. But I laughed for about three hours at that point. Sorry. Sorry I did ice. What Say you. I know that's your man too. Yeah, That's my man's. Did you laugh when he was Wally?


I've made that joke at him before. So No I didn't. So you didn't laugh? No, I've made that same joke. Hey man, that's nigga, here we go. They just walking. They got that good suits on. Look We Good on Nintendo Switch. At that point I knew Kai was talking to him like a fan. Kai just thought a fan was coming up to him. Gang. Alright gang. All right. Enjoy your day. Yo Nintendo switch type Of nigga though. He back talking my switch. Look gonna Lie. Listen, but I see, I heard it was like crazy though. Look at the chat. The chat will fix you up. Yep. I It was crazy bro. Look at the phone. Kai Wally. Oh my god. That was somebody crazy. That was Wally. Chad Knows him. The whole Chad knows Wally. Wally What he do? Rap. Oh that's Like flower.


Oh shit. Wow. Say more about dude than it do Wale. Yeah it do. No it just says, it Just says what does it say? It say young and don't know none of that shit. That's I'm saying. We just said on a pod before that a lot of these streamers are not, they didn't grow up in hip hop. That's what I'm saying. They just not hip content babies. That's what I'm saying. It just say he not, he not tapped name like that. I just got flipped them behind the scenes about that Earlier's had enough success to be considered just like a, It is not like he's an underground rapper. Right. Some people are not tuned. They didn't grow up in hip hop. Where would cross Radar? 23. Yeah, he Would've been there Wale's last album was what?


Well, Pete Hule, he would've been 10. 10 still. That's like I'm saying they not That's super young. That's yeah, You right. Three or four. You know that's not True. And if you what doing that 10, like when we were 10 we had older brothers. We couldn't change the station on the radio. You get your head knocked off. You was fucking it. Tim, I think that's important to highlight. Like my 10 was different from yours. Yeah, mines too. Don't just make it seem like we was all in the same game. Fucking at 10 but no you just 11 nigga. Yo. You said he was nine when he started fucking he said 11 right? Ish. Oh alright. The next year I was almost at high school At 11 years old.


11. Yeah. Nigga Ish. I in middle school. Who Do you think is listening right now? I was in Middle school at 11. What grade were you in at 11? Seventh, eighth. Eighth. That Right nigga at 11 You was an eighth grade at 11. Nigga. Shit he used be trying to come off like so you graduated in 15 math? He sixth grade. He is 11. No math like that Anyway. Yo. Sorry dog Grade and 12. We dumb as hell. Look at up just at five bro. Whatever grade It is at five. Oh he got skip. How many times you gotta skip? It is twice. He was fucking in the sixth grade Be twice anyway. Yo wouldn't it up. But it depends on what you was doing at 10. Every 10-year-old wasn't the same. If you had older cousins, older brothers, et cetera. You listen to the music they listen to.


Got it. Got it. That was me. You Feel what I'm saying? So if he ain't have no older brothers at 10 years old, he might not have known who the fuck Wale was. And there's no crime. Like he ain't trying to play Wale. No, he just didn't know who he was. That's I he didn't, I ain't saying this is bad. I'm just saying het try. I'm just saying we shouldn't be. I don't want people to look at it like that means something bad about Wale. I'm just saying. No I don't think anybody's saying, just say Homeboy wasn't tapped into hip hop. It's Just a disconnect. He And the chat like Joe said, the chat corrected him. Yo. That's why I laid the chat, wrote it. So that's just what It is. It ain't like he said yo who the fuck is that? Oh that nigga. He like, he oh Oh don't start leaning your head. He was cool about it. Don't start leaning your head to the right. Come on. What you guys say? I'm just saying that's my man. That's Wally nigga. Start leaning your head to say I don't, 'cause I don't have a take right here at this part.


Like as somebody that wasn't always a A-list sle. I don't think about, I don't any offense to somebody not knowing who I am actually when I get around these young kids. Yeah. I thank God that they don't know who I am. Like I'm not. You said that, you said that before. I'm so happy about that. And when the 1 0 6 tribute was going off and my girl was talking to her daughter, she was like nah, you don't know nothing about no B 2K. And I got offended when she said it and I was like yo don't be stupid man. She fucking knows B 2K And then I started doing math and I'm like oh she 17. Yes. She definitely dunno no B 2K. She could not know B 2K.


B 2K. Yes. They only know me from prospects. The kids don't be knowing shit about shit. So I mean if he wouldn't have recognized me, listen my first time ever seeing s that in person was install it, he was with a Boogie. I was on the side Boogie doing my A Boogie. It is not you. She is. He had no idea who I was. There you go. I wasn't offended. Right. I was actually happy because my A boogie what I was doing at the time. You ain't need at not at all. So I don't, this was just a funny moment. Was Waley offended? Yes. Yes. How do we know that? Because I spoke to him.


Oh, okay. I didn't know. I know if he likes, if he'd said something publicly. He did. He did say something. He did. I missed it. Okay. Oh well let me play it for You right here. Oh, okay. This was when Now Kai Sinat. Kai Sinat first of all is doing so great. Amazing. Like amazing Joe. He's outta here. Yeah. So that's another reason he could not know. He's outta here. If you not Aiden Ross. What's that little nigga Flipper? Speed. The nigga always flipping around. Yeah. Speed. Speed. Always Flipper. DDG. If you not them DaVero. Yeah. They got the whole little world on this. So Consonant is talking big business to Snoop after the awards. Hey man, we gonna get together. Got some plans.


Wale comes right over there, lemme play it. That shit making me look crazy right now. Just letting you know what that's making me look crazier than the, the the exchange that we had in the hallway. It is, It is. Oh my bad bro. I'm running with it. But we'll talk Later. Yo, I was a good that that that that didn't help. That didn't help at all. I don think knew that dude was str like I don't know. Well then that's, then that's, and that's part of not knowing, that's part of the problem. Like we can't be mad at Kai Sinat for not knowing who we are and we don't know who he is. Yeah.


If you know who he is then you know that camera's on Exactly 24 7. And if you're not familiar with that then you maybe not all the way familiar with what he does the same way he isn't with you. There is a disconnect. Yes. Yeah. I laughed at dis 'cause Kai Annet still was talking to him like a fan. He still was like, nah, nah, nah, no. You think so? Nah. That's just how he So he just no, he just play. I don't even think he really remembered. Yeah, he's not, he's there's so many things going on. That's just how he, so he tried to be kind to everyone. He's just a kind guy. I yo so Lou, he doesn't try to come off disrespectful at all. I agree with that. I don't think he intentionally was trying to play Wale. Got it. I see what you saying. I'm not saying that. I don't Think so. I think that honestly from Wale sitting up there and just kind of listening to him, he has, he has some real PTSD from like a lot of the exchanges that he's had through this industry.


Like so do we. I I get it but it's just, it's it's unhealed Even in that, that's just kind of what I process even. Man, you ain't healed. I'm actively working on, I'm, I'm healed But this is, I healed. Hold on. After you done then and you are not healed Now. We just had a conversation on that balcony and I now I have a bone to fucking pick with you about that shit and the shit you played. 'cause you knew when you were talking to me and you didn't say fuck all. But anyways, but, But here, here, here's my thing. What you said about that. Here's my retort to that. Y'all not healed but this is our healing space. We all get healed Here. Kind of agree a Little bit talking to each other. Jokes. That's wrong. Kevin Hart opened the award by saying stop trying to get healed and on podcasts.


Podcasts. No, no. But It is d this is not just stop nigga don't listen. Fuck she cool. But no that's not, that's not, that's not what this is. It is a bunch of people coming together from different parts of life and able to engage with each other. Say shit that we wouldn't allow somebody to say, hear how we feel about it. Navigate through it, laugh about it. This is a healing process. That is a fact up here. We're not, we, we can't hide from the shit that we try to hide from a real, real life. Okay. I was spacing off. I know you wanna be funny and shit like that but I have to acknowledge how the JBP is sort of, of, of a healing process for some of us nigga. But for him he, It is just seems Hold bird ass nigga. That's What I saying. Your point is received and I agree with what you're saying. I appreciate that.


Thank you for highlighting that. Don't leave your head, don't leave it. Go to the go to the left. Not the right. When I was mentioning Wale, well she mentioned Wale not being healed and when I mentioned mail and me not being healed respect it was to say that we endured, we a little bit more maybe saw a different part of the game than whatever the fuck you talking about. Like you a bird. I'm gonna fuck you up nigga. Like we was moving you talking about like some pod shit. We really are not healed 'cause we've seen too Yeah but we always moving in, in our not of scar tissue.


But you don't think that she come up. We've seen way too much nigga. I scar tissue got a consu I can foul But it'll probably be received different as a dude. Oh, I see you talking about. You talking about that type of, okay, I'm just saying we have seen a lot of stuff. Got you. And we haven't healed and we close to 50. You 35 or some shit. How old are you nigga? Yeah, 37. Yeah, you up when real niggas are talking nigga watch your fucking mouth nigga. I been through this shit too. But when they coming up here cracking the Joes on my niggas and having reality checks, I'm like oh all cool. That's it. I'm gonna play this again. Just 'cause it's funnier. The more you play it poor. That shit making me look crazy right now. Just letting you know what? That's making Me look crazy. That's not even an intro when somebody's talking to Snoop on his side.


Yeah, It is not. Yo, thanks for making me look crazy. That shit that happened earlier. He said that shit. No, he said that shit. That shit makes Me look crazy. The right intro. He didn't say thanks. He said that not the right intro Exchange that we had in the, He didn't even remember him. He don't even know what he's talking about. He has no idea. Yeah. So you gotta see the big kaza back, back to what office. Anyway, shout to Wale, man. Shout Like even you speak to the PTSD t s that he, that he talks about, even the story he told up here about the, the whole award. Yeah. With Kendrick winning over him. Somebody that worked there came out and told the other side of it and made it make a lot of sense.


It wasn't that they played you, it was, they played a prerecorded acceptance speech afterwards that you thought was that award you left and still won the award. You just wasn't there. So they accepted on your behalf. Mm. He didn't get that part. Like, there was clarity in that. But again, when you just, Wale's just very, very, very jaded from everything in the industry. Totally get it. I totally get it. He, I, I, I think it's a combination of PTSD, a lot of anxiety. A huge dose of like hyper perfectionism. 'cause you know, the whole Virgo thing got brought up and we know, we know that that's a, you know, characteristic of Virgos. But he just, you could just see it in his eyes that he just, he, he removes himself and then he, you kind of become unsocialized when you remove yourself for a lengthy amount of time.


Then you go back out into the wild and you're just like, you know, it just gets, it gets a little crazy for you. Yeah. Like I'm, I'm not even gonna go into like the details of the conversation, but when that first exchange happened with him and Kai, he hit me up. Really? I wanna react and I'm like, yo dog, there's nothing to react. Damn. How did, I mean, this niggas always hit a freak without getting into I freeze without get into details. Who fuck are you? Did he, did he feel like he was disrespect nigga? Fuck You nigga. He's a sensei. Yeah, he felt like that. And I was like, yo dog. It wasn't that like, they are disconnected. That's all he, He felt like that's good. Was Slate. Did he feel like Kai knew who he was and was trying to play him? Or he felt like he should have known who he was? Either Way. He felt like he was To, he was trying to play. Okay. Either way he looked at it as a slight yes.


And again, you can't the way somebody, but It's a different kind of slate if it's like, you should know who I am. It is more ego than it's still a slight, I think you know who I am and you're trying to play me still a that's almost like a paranoia. The reason I'm asking Yeah. Is 'cause there are some artists, I'm not saying necessarily why, 'cause I don't know him, but there's some artists who, if their whole brand is the mainstream, don't fuck with me, the industry, don't fuck with me. Then you look at every interaction, every moment through that lens so that everything that happens you take as an offense. Whether It is or it isn't. That's why I'm trying to understand sort of what, what his mindset is. Kai didn't know who Killer Mike was when Killer Mike won the award. Like true Kai is not going to know everyone. Yeah.


Everyone. The good rappers. Well, that's not true. 'cause a Boogie's a good rapper, but you know what I'm saying? He doesn't claim to be a hip hop like Expert. A Boogie got a younger demo than the booth of them. Yeah. Yeah. That's it. Yeah. For Sure. Yeah. That's, that's really it. My last topic that I wanna discuss with y'all happened prior to the BET awards when they were doing press. Shout out to all the podcasters that went down there and huddled up in the, in the press room. I'm never doing that. But out to y'all that, that do, Jim Jones was doing the interview. Sierra Bum rushed his interview to tell him that he should get married to Chrissy because she feels it in her spirit and because they've Been together long Enough, she deserves it and you deserve it.


And she's beautiful. And I'll just play it. Can I, okay. I was gonna Say capacity. No, I got a better Come on Shout DJ yourself. It said Happy Shout to Sierra. Jim, I just really need this to happen. I don't want mad at me because I don't know how you gonna feel, but I really need y'all to just go ahead and I'm coming in hot. Should I just stay on what I'm on right now? I stay on it because why not? Why not? She says Like, y'all have like lived life in every capacity. Anyone could live in it. You live like you've already done it. So let's just seal it properly.


Let's seal it properly Shouts to Jim Because you know what? He deserves it. You deserve. Why not? Like I look at y'all and I'm like, they're so, It is so fly. Chrissy is so beautiful. And so I thought this entire shit was fringe word, Super disrespectful. Down, down, down. Like he'd have been wrong if he'd reacted like old Jim to me. Yes. Would It would've been. It would've would've been. And I Got excited because I love the music and what you meant to me coming up. And also when I see y'all like from a love perspective, From a love perspective, like so many people, It's time. This shit pissing me off. It's timeall.


It's time. Okay. It is time. My take on this, I think that that was extremely rude of Sierra. Unbeknownst to her beyond. I don't think she had bad. I don't think she was purposely. Yeah. Yeah. It is like when you go To your Yeah, but she need to be told that though. Unfortunately. 'cause people do that. Just jump out. This is some of the rudest shit I've heard. Jump Out with some rude ass question about your life that has nothing to do with them. Sh Just because you found what you got and you, you know, Sierra's prayer. All the girls say all that type of shit. Cool ma. That ain't got nothing to do with him or Chrissy. Yeah. Or, or their situation. And who are you to go in that and and, and impose that on they life That was mad.


Should be told that. So you don't do that to somebody else who might get a little disrespectful and say, mind your fucking business. That's a great point. And be well within they right to say. So. You don't even know what you're triggering inside my household. You don't know Nothing. This might have been a, a, a deep point of contention at one point that we needed a lot of therapy to be able to get through and now here you go. Or Still going through. Yeah. Yeah. And here you go saying this adding award show on media day. Now it's viral now it, it, it keeps coming. Now it's coming back up. You're Saying this knowing what Jim and Chris went through even on Love and Hip hop with that whole proposal thing, you know that that's a sensitive subject for them two. Jim came up here. I know them both and didn't utter a fucking word about it.


Not at all. Not at all. Nothing. I think you mad outta place to do some shit like that. Yeah. So for Sierra to do that. What man, No, I was just, I complete and total agreement and there's no, I don't understand why she would need to be told she is a grown ass woman. You don't want anybody in your business with your husband. Why would you do that? Why would you interrupt his in? That was obviously we all love Sierra interview, but that was wild. If I would be, if I was him, I would be so offended. I'd be so Pissed. I think first it depends on what their rapport is. Like. They might be fly. I still think she was outta pocket be clear. I still think she was outta pocket. But sometimes people be out pocket and don't know.


I think, I think that's true. And that's why I say Need a lot of times people to be out pocket and don't know. Especially The church people. Especially Church. Especially the church people. That's A good, they come up there to you when you having a baby. Yeah. Yo, you don't know what this couple done been through. You don't know if she can or can't have a baby. You don't know what that Right question could. Yeah. You don't even know what that question trying to have a baby. That's true. Good Point. Mind your fucking business about other People's Lives Surely could have just miscarried two months ago. You Right. Yeah. That to me That's true. I That sounded like a little bit too much dip on your chip. Yeah. I hated every bit of it. If it had been in private, I still would've would've been outta pocket. Really? Yeah. Because sometimes it's like, why you doing this in public? This is one of them. Even if you pulled me aside it in the corner and said that shit to me It is mind your fucking business.


For the same reason. I love, I ado Sierra, but unfortunately sometimes when people feel like they got the moral high ground and that's What I mean, dip on The chest and they're on the right side of stuff. They feel like they have a right to tell you whatever they want. Yeah. And then they shielded in the language of, well, the spirit told me to do it. No. Yeah. Spirit ain't tell you It is you being nosy. That ain't God. That's You. Right. And that's your values and your, and again, you can impose your values at times not here. And y'all don't know each other like that. I thought Jim actually carried it much better. He carried it great. That's why I said shouts to him. Yeah. He carried it great. Yeah. I mean he, He was mature. He said the right things. I was actually very impressed how he, how he, how he did it. 'cause yeah, he could've took it a whole different way and would've been wrong if he had, but I don't think he would've did That. No, but I'm just, it ain't go to the 10th degree. It could have just been like, that's my business mind your own business.


It could have been having a bad day. And you come and we coulda just been arguing about that. And here you come. You don't know what the fuck mind your business mother, Dog. He coulda he could have responded in the most respectful way that there is to respond. And it's, we still would've heard. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Still would've heard with Tyler. We'd ever heard it. If he'd have said sweetie respect. With all respect, do That already right there. Yeah. Already Right there. So it's like stopped right there. I don't like people even putting people in that position. He could have stopped. He the bad guy. It Is no way for me to look the way All I, all I can do is say I understand. Thank you. Thank you for you. I appreciate that. Yep. Like girl, so lemme ask you a question. If you're Chrissy, do you got not beef?


But do do you take issue with Sierra at this moment? No. No. They probably friends. No. No. They probably friends. Gotcha. Like I, I can't imagine that Sierra had that conversation without at least having met Chrissy before. Yeah. You're not just watching from afar. Right. And now you, there has to Be some relationship. Yes. The fuck people do that. Nah, that ain't true. I mean, hopefully they do have a relationship. Would I'm giving Sierra the benefit of the doubt. I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't. It wouldn't shock me. It would not shock me. Wouldn't shock. They've never spoken, never met or anything. I would not be shocked. People do exactly that. Get extra nosy and just go throw some wild ass question about your life. Why your fucking business? Because I can see Chrissy feeling like you just embarrassed me.


'cause now the whole world's talking about why I'm not married again. Even though you're doing it on my, on my behalf. It's not Who Are you to speak on my behalf? I'm with you. That's what I'm saying. I could, I could see Chrissy being really pissed about that. 'cause we wouldn't be on a podcast talking about them not being married right now. If not for that conversation. Which might embarrass her. Hey worldwide. Hey, check, check this out. Check this out. For all you know, they married. Yeah, that's what I was about. Say there You go Again. Again. Mind fucking business. You don't know. That's the only answer. Just mind your business about marriage and about like you said and about kids, because that's another thing that people feel like they have a right to say in church and family at Thanksgiving. You don't know what people are going through. Like you said, you don't know what, why or what just happened.


Everybody's minding your business about people's personal life. It's a fact. That's, that's It. Alright. We done with the awards, right? There's nothing else. There's nothing else. Awardee. Lemme make sure I had nothing that we gotta get to. I wanna shout out Terrence J just for always looking the way you're supposed to look. That's my man. That's my man. It's Old River Road alumni man. That's old Terrence J in the same real hall of fame. The fucking damage he caused over there. We gonna find out who was in that car. Man. Guy's crazy. That's my man though. Anyway, come on. Let's see what else is important. We do have a couple of resting pieces to give out. Yes, It was, it has been a rough week for black culture.


Man. There's, there's, there's a few RFPs. One y'all not gonna know, but I think it's important to say. That's Brother Naba or Richard Muhammad. He was the editor in chief of the Final Call newspaper for 33 years. Final call is the most important, one of the most important black newspapers in America. One of the oldest, one of the most influential newspapers in the world. Richard Muhammad helped resurrect the nation Islam with this newspaper and its educated black people around the country, around the world, people around the country, and around the world for decades. He passed away three days ago. So rest in peace. In peace in love and peace to his family. Last week we saw Sam Moore pass away. Y'all know Sam Moore from Sam and Dave. Yeah. The classic soul group.


Most people know at least one song from them, which is Soul Man, but lots of hits, incredible talent. And he's one of them people who, unfortunately Sam and Dave, both of both of them got kind of tucked away in history because a lot of people associate that song with the Blues Brothers, with the Blues Brothers, Dan Roy, and Right. So we often forget his contribution. But Sam and Dave made an extraordinary contribution for sure. He was an incredible singer and a and a and a great artist. And rest in peace to him too. Wayne Lewis from Atlantic Star. Mm. Okay. Woo. You can't Yeah. Secret. Oh, you looking at me like that? That's, that's your secret lovers. Some people or Clover sin for me.


Always. All Lee Mark What? I ain't say nothing. I love you, man. Everybody got they jam. That's one of I love Secret Lover. That's mine too. Is it? Sing it. Secret Lover. Yeah. But Wayne Lewis, lead singer, beautiful voice, extraordinary artist. We send rest in peace to him too. For sure. And then there's one more. I'm saving the one for last to me, to hit me the hardest save ly stone. Man. Man, man, man. Rest in peace. Ly stone. I don't use the word genius or brilliant often.


He's both, He's both, there are just few artists who mean as much to not just black music, but to music as Sly Stone. Sly Stone is your favorite artist. Favorite artist. Sly Stone was an incredible dj, an incredible radio host who became an incredible band leader who put together one of the most important and influential band of the decade. Their run wasn't that long. 68 to about 71. But they, I mean, they sold millions of records, had millions of hits. I mean, all your favorite rappers have sampled them. All your biggest hits have come from them. He's the first person to put a, a program drums on a major, a radio hit on, on a major hit.


I mean, he is, I think the prototype and the blueprint for, for music for Sure. Folk. Folk especially. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you don't, he is the, I would say the father of, of of funk. Certainly modern, the Woodstock performer. I mean, I could go on and on about slo stone, but I think for me, the thing that I remember about him when I think about him is sometimes people try to make him seem like he was tame and domestic. 'cause he had a multicultural band and everybody looked different. Like he, he was a rebel. He was making rebel music. He was, and at that moment, even what that band looked like and the messages that they had, that that was resistance. Exactly. Yeah. Soad, the sly stone. I hope everybody should go watch the Quest Loves documentary on that came out this year.


It's worth watching. Yeah. It It was fantastic. I talked, I talked about it here a little bit. It absolutely fantastic. I think it's Amazon. I wanna say Hulu. Hulu. Hulu, Hulu. Absolutely fantastic. Yeah. But rest in peace to Sly Stone and to all the giants who, who passed away this week. I'm glad he got his flowers in the form of that documentary while he was still with us too. Yes. Yeah. He deserves them and so much more.

No. No. You Didn't empty your trash.


That's how you get caught A lot. The trash. That's how they catch you. You don't empty the trash. I didn't mean to say that. She is she here? You know, There's a folder where shit goes. I'm sorry for like 30 days Recently. Sound like y'all want to hear. Yeah, We want to hear you. Goddamn. Everyone wanna hear It? Absolutely. Let's see if I can find it. Yeah, go down there. Recently deleted. Oh shit, you had a whole shit. He did a whole podcast on his phone, son. He did a whole podcast on Back one That's so fucked up. Like unbelievable. Oh damn. Now my secret's going Whoopsies. Anyway, moving on. What else we got? What else we got? Oh really? We're moving on. Yeah, we'll get back to that later. We'll get back to that later.


Big man. Did y'all see Oh, oh no, please. I was asking Flips to tell me about the YouTuber. There was a, a situation. Okay, That's pretty serious. I do you want to get, we want to get into that now. No. Pardon? So three, two, come on. What about what? Go ahead. How we go from Superhead to the fuck tragic. Then We came in that off of, nevermind. Did y'all see Boogie Cousins about to fuck this guy up? The fan in Puerto Rico. This guy, He was about to fuck a good portion of that crowd up. Right? I I think Boogie was wrong though. What Park? From what I saw, the interaction started with the fan throwing up two middle fingers Boogie then grabs his dick and starts walking towards the fan.


His own dick. His own? Yeah. Oh yeah. He need to be clear on that. I'm sorry. I'm just saying. So yeah, like basically inviting him to Yeah. You know, to the Frank stand. Exactly. Then he walks over to the guy and tries to grab his hand to pull down the middle finger. So Boogie initiated the physical contact to me as a fan, you shouldn't be throwing middle fingers if I hate that shit. But you got a right to do it. I agree with that. Boogie got a right to say whatever he want back, but once you make physical contact, that's on you. You can't do that. So when the fans started throwing drinks at him, I understood why. Again, you can't throw drinks at somebody and once you throw drinks at somebody, boogie got a right to run up in the stands. Like it's the malice in the palace. So again, I'm saying all of that is wrong, but Boogie initiated the contact and you can't do that.


He did. That's all I'm saying. That's all I I'm saying you can't go around touching people. You can't put your hands on people. And why is, and like Joe always says, I I see it a little different, but words shouldn't be making you mad if they wanna put your hands on nobody or fingers or fingers 'cause Right, well There are times, right? What I mean, what did y'all think? What y'all saw it? Because I feel like y'all was on Boogie side. Well no, because I, the first first clip I saw was when he was, after he was ejected. Mm. I saw that one first. And he was walking, they start throwing the beer on him as he's being walked out the, the off the court, whatever. And he got ready to try to run up there and fight the, is That right? Y'all good with that? Yes. I'm all the way good With that.


If so, if a fan throws a drink at you again, we gonna go live Joe Button podcast on the road. There's a chance we could be somewhere and someone throws a Pepsi on one of us. Are we supposed to rush the audience? Supposed to. You added a word in there or I mad Would we be mad Mad at that person reacting that way when you throw something and actually hit them? I'm not mad at that. You do it. You do it. You gotta be prepared for whatever. Come with it. When you throw something at somebody, some people will fuck you up. Some others Won't. If you're a seven foot professional athlete, you shouldn't beat someone up for a Pepsi. I'm not saying it's right for him to throw the Pepsi, but you shouldn't beat someone up.


It also should be the first person you put in the beer batter. I mean it's, I agree with Mark, but y'all know my stance in this. So I don't wanna ruin a good guitar. But y'all but Joe, for you are It is throwing a Pepsi closer to words or is that closer to putting their hands on you? I'm not putting my hands on nobody that throws Pepsi at me. That's okay. And they hit you with the Pepsi? Yeah. And they and they are in close proximity to you. I really love when my kids call me. No, I really love being there for my children. So what's the I love being there. Lemme ask you a question. My family. I love freedom. I love and also being able to, to support said family and not be sued. No. Hey, It is the smaller things than that. I love when I'm thirsty at night when I walk to the fridge.


I also, You, I'm trying to catch a, now if you tell me, if you tell me that you hooking off on somebody to do that, I'm not going scold you. No, I'm No, no, no. It's not even about me. I'm just saying 'cause your stance is your words can't make me do nothing if somebody's not putting they hands on me. That's what you always go by. So somebody hitting you with something, With something a liquid. The Pepsi is not, that's why s that close to the words or hands for you because The liquid, The liquid is not gonna do it. Salt No, I know legally, but I'm saying in terms of how you react. Like I'm a react. If somebody smack you, that's one thing. Totally. If somebody throw Pepsi from 10 feet away at a basketball game and you a pro, I'm just saying I understand the anger and I don't know what I would do in that situation in real life.


But I would my best self, I would like to not rush the stand. You would swing. I might. I'm saying if you would swing, we had to, I don dunno if rush the though. Yeah. That's why I said the proximity matters. Yeah. Like they, you throw in my face and they just get it off. Like when Ron Artes was laying on the table. Yeah. The, The second cub in of Nolan. Ryan just threw that shit from way over there. Just landed on a nigga chat. That's something different. 'cause he had to go physically to the stands. But if somebody's in arms' distance from you and they throw something at you and it hits you, come on bro. And also it's like, like you don't have no right to do. And also the liquid and the liquid inside of the can or the cup is different because that's just, Yeah.


If it's a beer bottle, that's a different conversation than Yeah. A a paper cup full of soda. Well you in an arena, they're not even giving out glass bottles. Like it's, you don't even know who really did it. You looking for some, you looking, I mean like that's just, that's But the people in the crowd usually point to who did it. Yeah. They tell, they tell. That's true. Flip. What do you do in that situation? High security like you did at I was about to say you did. Is that what you Security to protect From yourself. Security. Yes. That's smart. I did. That's genius. I high security. 'cause it's just the best thing to do was a great idea. Genius. When you going somewhere and afraid flip. Oh no. It's not about being afraid, but I'm talking about you. But, but, but, but what I wanna say is that I'm talking about when I've hired, I've had to go places I was afraid.


But here's the thing. Here's the thing with you and I'm gonna have this dialogue with you, nigga. Before you tap dance for your man, pay attention. You've been trying to get me to be on the straight and narrow and be safe out there while I'm creating content. You've also, you, you also champ you also champion me hiring security. Yo, you be out there because you know I'll be out there ready to get aggressive. If somebody playing with me say something. Touch me. So I think hiring security to be that buffer is the best course of action. Especially when you flip, you know you going, I'm 100% agree with you. Thousand percent. I'm being performative because We on air and I'm never gonna stop that because Your arms are short. Oh. You can't really grab em In real life. Reaching for the look. Get for the yo.

And Godfrey was telling somebody that black people been around for how many years and that the white people just came around like four years ago. So then he said listen, I'm telling you Google it.

Alright. Funny. I was molested on the CoStar. Alright, I can't drag this out any longer. So pause. We do have to get to the YouTube murder.


Yes. I was just looking it up. Yeah, we do have to get to the YouTube murder from what I gather, two YouTubers. You can still look it up. I'm talking about you time. Okay. I did a radio. Yeah, go ahead. The people think that me and you have beef and our friendship is better than this other right now. Best the best bro. I love you. I'm not you. Hey Yo Finn, the legend and his wife Bubu bubbly, were gunned down in Las Vegas by a YouTuber named Sin City. This is some sick shit. So what happened was they, I guess this, It is been a beef going on for that stemmed from two years ago. They encountered each other before. I think the guy maced the wife and then instead of Finney responding with aggression, he just went on YouTube and was cracking jokes and stuff like that.


And apparently the other guy felt like, yo, you're making fun of my mental health. So while that, while they were in Vegas, outside on the strip recording, it happened. It happened. Yeah. Yeah, I saw, yeah, It happened on live. It was very disgusting. His wife name is Bubbly. Finney the Legends was the one that got killed Gunned down and Sin City family was the one who did it. You know what I mean? He ended up turning himself in and all that. But it's disgusting man. It's disgusting that, I mean when going online or when things that happen online, It is taking too far. You know what I mean? It is. It's crazy.


Rest in peace to them. Yeah. Rest in peace. Yeah. I ain't got nothing to add. Ain't nothing to add to that. Yeah, there's nothing to add. Rest in peace. Thoughts? Some prayers. They young too. Yo, I don't know how old anybody is. I mean I just, that's what I was looking at. I just seen the pictures of 'em. They now older. I can't imagine. Did the wife die too? Yes. Yes. Wow. She was trying to stop him from like when she was trying to get in between them, she's like, yo don't, don't come over here with that. Do not come over here with that. And then that's when he opened, fired a fire on Finney the ledge. He opened fire on him and then she went to get the phone and then he opened fire on her and just walked off.


And a busy Las Vegas strip. A very busy Las Vegas strip. Super unfortunate story. Rest in peace. Peace. Rest in peace to the people that we lost. From what I saw, it looks like the shooter was driving around the day before trying to find them as well. It seems like a big part of their ongoing beef was like they were doing some channel strike thing where I'm gonna try to get your channel as many strikes as possible, which is gonna affect how you show up in the algorithm, which is gonna affect your dollar job might get you shut down altogether.


Yeah. Three strikes or whatever the rule is. It is three You right? Three. Yeah. Yeah. Your page is, your page is done also a few days before the murder. Well, they went and found the video of the guy who was killed saying that this guy may have a mental health problem. Yeah. He's 32. Jesus. Mm. Damn. It's crazy bro. What I'll say is, and this is, you know, hindsight, It is 2020. If you believe someone to truly have a mental health problem, it's, It is not a laughing matter. It is not a joking matter and it's not anything to get on your YouTube page. It's not something to try to instigate or provoke.


It's not something that you want to use as an insult. I'm certainly not defending the killer here. I'm not that. And if that's how, come on. I'm not trying to do that. This is in the aftermath of it. Clearly the guy may have had a mental health issue. So this is just sad. All around the board lesson for content creators out there. Yeah. True. Like it can get real fast and, and, and you could be all with the shits, but that don't mean that your loved ones are with the shits. So your wife is with the shits. You never know where you'll be or who you'll be with. Right. That's true. When, when it comes coming true.


So, or If you got kids. Yeah, It is, It is, It is sad to, to See that. Right. Like how, how it played out. Extremely unfortunate. And I'm not gonna hold you, I'm sorry. Flip just as, just as a someone with wifi. I'm sick of seeing murders in 4K. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sick of seeing the video Dog isn't niggas that got whole pages of shootings and fights like they're making content and they, I think they're monetizing these pages off of just fights and shootings. They be having women fighting each other, young girls fighting each other. That shit is nuts. Yeah, It is. It is Disgusting man. This is men's mental health awareness moment.


Yes. This is an opportunity to remind everybody again, if you see people who are in need, try to intervene, try to support people. Don't assume that everybody's doing it for attention and everybody will be okay. They just need to pray it away. They just need to eat better. They just need to, we got all these solutions. Some stuff needs medicine, some stuff needs hospitalization, some stuff needs professional help and we gotta support each other other. And when you see the signs, do something about it. 'cause a lot of times people are ticking time bombs and the only reason more people aren't being killed is just by luck. Not not. 'cause what we're doing is working. That's All. I agree. Yeah. Thoughts? Some prayers. Thoughts. Some prayers. Yeah. Thoughts and prayers. Indeed. Let me play a song and try and get y'all to feel a little better.


Yeah. Mic check. Mic check. Hopefully y'all still with us out there and we didn't lose you again. Rest in peace to the people that lost their lives. Tragic. Tragic. I know. Speaking for me and me only. I'm way more paranoid in places where there are a lot of people. Yes. Today. I know. That's where you normally feel safe. Uhuh.


Not today. It's the opposite. Mm. It's the opposite for me. Yo, please be careful out there. This summer's about to get hot niggas home from jail and they plotting. Wow. Head on a swivel at all times and try to get home to your family. Rest in peace. Luther Banro. You Minute day that I don love you at always. I still remember in the days when I scared how I spend my daydream.


I you must known that. Alright. What we getting into? What we getting into? What needs our attention out There? Hey.


All right. Is anybody watching the NBA finals? Someone is. I watched a little bit of game too, but then it was a blowout so I stopped. I watched both games. Did you? I, because they're saying that this is, you know, obviously low rated small market teams, no one's gonna watch it. I was just curious to know if that's like playing out in y'all lives. Because I don't know anybody that's watching it. I'm trying to watch it. I watch, I'm a basketball nerd so I try to watch it games, but I was just curious to know if anybody was watching it and also who y'all think gonna win. Well how's it going? I mean is it Captivating? I think so. It's very good basketball. Very good basketball. Yeah. I was gonna say one of the best game ones that, yeah, I don't know what the ratings are but as a basketball fan Yeah. What was high? I'm entertained. Well they putting out all the reports that say this is the lowest rated finals since y.


Yeah. No superstar. We could have. Yeah we could have. Cool. No superstar in small market team. That combo is tough. It is way bigger than that. I think again, I think the NBA is doing a horrid job of promotion. Oh, of pushing. Covering the finals. Yeah. Yeah. Game two was the lowest since the bubble. Right. At some point we gotta stop playing small market and no stars. You have your MVP, you have the league MVP there. That should be enough. And Hall Burn has been on a tear. It's not. Yeah. And he's popular with the girls on TikTok. According to my wife, Louis's TikTok. But stars are people that transcend the sport. So when you start talking about Steph Curry, people's moms know who Steph Curry is.


People's mother don't know who Shea Gilchrist Alexander is Dog. It's Adam s. Silver job to make people care about what's going on. I'm not disagreeing with you. I'm I'm not. I'm just saying it could be a combination of things, but the know star factor is definitely a thing. Okay. You should still reach out to your marketing In our PR departments partner, you have partners, you have media partners, You have ad partners, you have a bunch of different partners. Make star. Is that No names SGA in a truck for an ad for this finals. Does That make the average person though? Turn on the game? Depending on how Well I'm really asking. I think A bunch of little shit adds up to point A big shit story. Really Listen, No matter who's playing in the Super Bowl that week off that they take Media week and the talk that happens from that during that whole two weeks, if you didn't care about none of these teams, you'll be Interested and they'll find you something to care about.


Hard football and basketball though. They'll put a narrative in there and find you something to care about too. I mean, yes, Football, I only bring it up because for the Super Bowl I could See that we are the person that don't give two fucks about football. Don't follow it, don't care about nothing. How they get real then. Yeah, But but that's bigger than the end. Yeah, but it's, It is game. It's one game. It's one day. You know That they do the halftime show of love with real people Win. I told y'all before the finals aired that the NBA did a has done a horrendous job you said On the first game. No, you're right. They Have, I heard they putting the finals. Didn't they put on the court stupid ass trophy decals on the on the on the, on the court. Yeah. Everybody complained then they got rid of those and CGI some other shit. People were slip shit. They said people was slipping or some Shit.


I know it was a crock of bullshit. It's a crock Of shit. Said somebody was slipping but total crock of shit. Alright, speaking of the finals, we got shout friend of the show, friend of everybody over here slay. He did the Halliburton, Halliburton De The one sneaker. Absolutely. Definitely the Puma Pu build. And then right after game one Halliburton tweets. It was the shoes, which I think was dope. That was dope. No, he bought the shoes to the podium for his press conference. That's fire. He had 'em in his hand. Sat down, fixed them on the, fixed them on the table and everything for his press conference. Fire. Fire. That was dope. So shouts to Solay for that one. I'm gonna watch the finals. Of Course everything I'm watching the final. Me too. But I don I don't feel like my entire network is watching. Yeah. I feel like we're kind of basketball fans, You know what I mean? We actually care about it. And y'all obviously got Molly wa by Indiana, so you wanna see this thing play out.


Does that make you root for them more or less? Did they beat the dog shit outta you? No. No. More or less. I'm once, once my team leaves. Jesus. Yo. Really? What the fuck? I didn't do anything. You laughing together. I never FaceTimed with her. That's old school rules. You can't laugh. We don't take the same yoga class. We are not in the same gym. I literal literally have never met this person. I don't know what she looks like. I could not pick her out. I don't know what she looks like. I don She ain. I don care. Can you not laugh while I'm talking to Mark? The the terrorizing has been going on for over 20 years.


I don't know why. I don't know what the obsession is. I don't, I mean, I get it. Of Course. I'm gonna cut it off now She gets it. She crazy. I'm gonna cut it off. But she said the obsession, don't laugh. Terrorizing. Yeah. Yo, you a piece of Shit. Yo. Funny. I don't even remember what We looked the finals Joe is a piece of shit. Yo. Oh, I know that. What, what do people feel about the actual finals Totally there. The games themselves. I mean, it's, It's good basketball. I think it's great. It's the same reason I like watching WNBA. Honestly It is. 'cause sometimes like when it's not all the flash and all the stuff where it's just like good ball movement, good defense, excellent coaching on both sides. It's like that's good basketball. Even in the blowout, I still enjoyed the style of basketball that I saw. And the the funny part was, even with the blowout with Indiana, you don't count them out.


Nah. After game one, you Can't nah. After what they did to the Knicks Multiple times to the Knicks. I hear y'all the the casual fan. When you cut the TV on and you're having your watch party, but then you just fucking finished making your dipping Doritos. You're not trying to see Andrew Nihart and the other mechanic face looking nigga. Right. Like in game two, they played both of them niggas together. The, the Nim Hart and the other short little mechanic face nigga talking about TJ McConnell? No. Oh, he's a black guy. Oh, black. Oh. Mustache chap. That nigga look like a seventies porn star. Yo, you Want Watch like he shoot that shit Andy played d he still look like a seventies Star. Like the team. And if they win we gotta have a different conversation about Rick Carlisle, But yeah, that's true.


Absolutely. Yeah. We gotta we gotta have a different talk. I kind of want him to win win. I still don't See him for them. I'm rooting for them hard. I don see him winning, but whatever I I think for all of, I'm not rooting against them. You should be rooting for them. Yeah. The team that beats you to win the, that beats lost the Champion. The champion To seven K. I'm a sports fan. I want see, I want to see the weak teams go home and get the best possible game that we could get. So if that's what this is, then I'd like it to look like that. Speaking of weak teams, the Knicks have announced or there's a rumor that the Knicks are looking you, Y'all gonna play yourself. If y'all, I could get a drop for you. You know, I don't want some, I don't think I know a few people I Can call call whole girl with a Mac.


Yo, come up here and give you the you don't know me. Mark. You need three to five. You three To five for that. Yo. Yes Sir. I figured it out. Y know me Mark. Oh shit. Yeah, there you Go. But anyway, the Knicks have considered, or the rumor is that the Knicks are considering Jason kid as their new head coach, that there's a mutual interest there. I was curious to know as Knicks fans, how y'all would feel if that was the, if that was the play instead of say Mike Malone or somebody like that. I would Love it. You'd be good with Jason Kid. I would absolutely love Jason Kid. I'm fine with that. Absolutely Love it. IIII tend not to believe any of the reports about my team. Mm. When Mikhail Bridges was traded, it was quiet. It quiet as the church bounce. Same with Kat. Nobody knew a thing.


I just don't see Leon Rose as the type to publicly promote his move before they happen now. So I don't believe, I don't believe we getting Greek free, Kevin Durant, Jason, kid, none of that shit. Would You, would you be happy just now we just throw it out there. Would you be happy if y'all traded Cat for kd? No, I think it's the dumbest shit in the world. That'd be Terry. I love that. I think it's the dumbest in the world. Would that Yeah, me too. I would be mad if we trade anybody for kd. Oh, you don't want kd? I would, I don't want him for the core, The core of the team. I don't want him for Bridges. OG Brunson or Kat shit or Mr. Robinson. I would, I he's 37 years old Josh. But y'all are one player away from a championship. Who says who says that? I'm just, I don't know that that one player has to be gargantuan in that way.


Yeah. Like see I think what happens in, in basketball, especially in bigger markets, we pushed the championship dog Kat just got there. This is first year there. Yeah. They, they didn't really start to gel until the middle of the season. Allow this shit. Don't, don't go breaking that up. Need to mature. Why would you break up the nucleus of that team? You just fired the coach. They gonna have to start from scratch with some new niggas. And I, I just think that rock out get better. Like I think the Hartenstein trade kind of hurt y'all in the end. But Try got some defensive to me. Y'all got some defensive gaps that can't be repaired by playing together. Like that's not a chemistry Issue. Name 'em. I mean at the, at the point y'all, He's the only, he's the only gap in what he makes up for on the offensive end of the ball.


And Kat is not, Kat's not an elite defender. See even what doing right now to me is a problem with the finals. Oh. Talking about the Knicks instead of the teams in The final. I've seen more we just Talking about the Knicks. 'cause you it's not, but it's not just, that's not true. The the talk online right. Is Nick talk, I've seen more Nick talk than the final Motherfucker want that big market dude. Niggas want to See New York in the Final zone by the time because usually It is LA especially to get that close right there to get as close as y'all got. Niggas like, oh yo, we niggas believe Now listen, they ain. They ain't give us the right refs. Usually it's If you were the right refs, we'd have been in the finals. Y'all had 'em. Nah, not that y'all Played better. Listen, speaking of basketball, speaking of basketball And OK C's getting a hell a bunch of calls.

I just wanna be But then they compared it this on the court but, but then he beat him one on one. He said okay but then Michael Bey played Jordan as well. That I don't know because they were saying he that Okay. 'cause it was something about Jordan never lost in one said he lost to Mike. They said lost to Michael Jordan. They said he lost to all Mike and beat the brakes off of LeBron. That's what they said. Yeah, he played Jordan. Yeah. Yeah.

Niggas who know That, I tell his story all the time up here. But when Michael Beasley came through the studio that day, all us lost our girls.

I tell you that's like when, what's his name came to the pool party. Who? Sean. Mary El Sean. The lip ain't worth Bro. That's fucked up Lip ain't worth Congratulations to Mike Beasley for winning. I mean we knew you would win but Yeah, good to see you. It wasn't A shock. Let's see what else, what else? Sexyy Red checks Ray J I don't know if anybody is. Yeah, Ray J saw that Ray JJ bugged out. Yeah, he went on his twitch and said that he had sex with sexy Red. He fucked up. Why would he do that? It was just weird.

But you know, he said that he was just trolling in That sense. What? Can't remember screenshots. I only saw him say I I I had sex with her. I didn't hear no, it was the screenshots with her saying that, yo, this is what we doing. Are you lying on your dick? Like you never had sex with me? And he responded that, you know, I was just trolling. I was just playing. I go clean it up right now. That's Not funny. That's even More corny. It's not funny. It's corny. Corny as fuck. And You, you clean it up behind the scenes. But yeah, you make the, you make the Statement publicly. I think he No I think he spoke about it publicly. Oh You don't have to say Nothing after the fact. Yeah, after she fucking outed Him. Like Mark ain't hear that. You know what I'm saying? Right. That ain't what gold, that's not what goes on.


I Got literally Exactly the lie gets halfway around the fucking or World before I understand What's Point gets his fucking pants on. In the last week of May, once I finished my making my morning coffee, I got a text from two people. It was Billy Jay and Ray Jay. I'm gonna read it. Alright. Billy said Joe, what's good bro? Ray wanted me to connect y'all. He wanted to hit you today about something. Ray, you could take it from here.


I said good morning gentlemen. But my radar is up. Of Course he Threw y'all on a group, group chat. Yeah, yeah. Yo, what? Okay go ahead. Well Then Ray J didn't have my number so I mean Oh okay, okay. Yeah, it's not a surprise. Alright. And then Ray I thought, hey brother, thanks Billy Joe, what up man? I want to do some strategy marketing with you please. And then I said Ray J, what the fuck are you talking about? You know what that means? You know exactly what That means. And then he said, when can I call you?


And then I said Strategy marketing regarding question mark. Question mark. Then I said, I'm fighting with my girl so it's gonna be a few hours before you can call me. Bunch of that always worked though. Yeah, that's all. Because Everybody can relate to that shit. Every man can relate. I'm fighting with my girl. Is Mark saying he couldn't find a sitter for the night the nanny pulled out. He can't, he won't be able to make kid sick. That's my version. Kids. The kids Is sick. I'm putting my baby to sleep. He said it's hard to type. Won't take long a voice note voice.


I say that to say a couple weeks later, Bomb, This is happening. No and you ain't seen. Oh so this your advice and it was just my shit. Right. But Amber told him, if you wasn't my brother, I'll let you eat me out. Yes. So they might be shock, shock value. Shit. Ray J is a media genius. So if he's doing something, I think he's doing it on purpose. On purpose of course. Even if that includes lying saying you slept with sexy red. So she dmd him on Instagram. Yo, what the fuck is up with this? Cleared up. So he cleared, tried to clear it up on some funny shit. Yo, I meant we slept together on a plane.


We were just seated next to each other. So then Sexy Red went off on Twitter. Yo dog got some weird ass shit. You lying on your dick even saying that we slept on a plane together, nigga I saw you. I said hi. I kept it pushing you on some weirdo, yada yada yada yada. But I read that was just like, yo, what Does Ray J have up his sleeve? You got something cooking, something's Going on. Something's cooking. Yeah. There's no circumstance where I'm doing that. None. What happened Mel? So I have literally had somebody say the exact same fucking thing. Literally Lying. Yes. Lying about sleeping with me. And then the whole like, oh well we were sitting on a plane together and you know you were sleeping or whatever.


I was like, not anyways. Wow. Oh you told us that story. Yeah. Yeah. I Remember that shit. It is A football player. Yeah, he told us that story shit Is dope. I mean I can understand this lot. It's fucking sexy red. Well that, that's the other thing. I didn't wanna say that but like what, what, what do you get for saying Lying popular bro to that demo? She's a young pop. That lie is the same lie. Yeah, the same intended. Wow. We response, I think Sexy Red look good. What you take over all that to them tattoos. She's a pretty girl. What that hena. She is pretty, she's very pretty like right before you go to bed and she just getting bare face. I was like, oh, sex sexy. I'm not saying she's not attractive, it just, it just seemed like at Ray J's big age.


Why are you lying on your dick? Lying On your dick? What do you get for saying all folks sexy? Like I don't understand that. Let's just say, I don't know. Doing like, like you said, if, if he's trying to get into that, that streaming world or something like that. Right. Got you. That is a younger demo. She is very popular to the younger demo. So if I say something and attach to her, it'll pop up on their radar. So. Got it. So he Used her without her consent. I don't Know if this was without her consent. Yes. Kind of looking that way. I Again, her reaction hit. But again, if he hit You right, if he hit Joe and say do some quote unquote strategic marketing could, there's nothing to say that he didn't hit her. And yo, I'm gonna do this. You do that. You curse me out, you curse me out, blah blah blah blah blah. I'll look this way. All of that.


And we can go, as I always say, everything's a rollout. Right. And this could have been all part of that. You're absolutely right. There is that possibility.

Okay Mark, what do you have to say about that Mark? I don't have anything to say but you mumble something I want to hear. Remember we discussed that? I started to reflect and then I realized that I don't know enough to have a thought. Yeah I think it's entirely possible that women have what'd you say Lied on Their pussy. Just allergies bro. If y'all tell me a girl and they said you know what? And said they fucked you fucked. I just wanna see her. I just wanna see a picture of her. I don't doubt it could happened but let's just investigate. Ain't nobody lying and say that they fucked. You know, Fuck that niggas look at these niggas that never s like Tyler Perry footprints.

I, you know, we we do a lot of shit for the camera but we, we nigga we are locked in. We are great. That's what's up. I'm appreciative and that's it man. I Love it. Shit. I got a few things written down here. What's up? No, no. Put my list to the side. I met with Mel yesterday and she said she had a topic for us. No, it was gonna be a Patreon one. Y'all met with each other on a Monday.


That's all. Flip her Right. Well call that other shit. Wait, what? Some, some business talk that's, he means you try to, it's between me and Mel. What month we, you, You right. Only the good guy. Please sir. You went straight to the I used to do the same thing. How I go straight to that nigga? We don't wanna go to the white man no more. We gotta play out. Play his all straightens. Okay. Mel, do you care about Coco? Coco golf? Yes indeed. Yes. Absolutely. Ly. I don't know what that is. Has She just won? Yeah, tennis. Tennis. Black tennis player. Black. Yeah. So she won first, first black French open winner since Serena in?


Yes. First American. Oh, first American. I'm sorry. American First American. And actually, hold on one second. Some shit for them niggas. She got, she got notes too? No, Mel has been doing her notepad. Mel been really like, I could tell she had a meet with you boy. She got notes. Would you just shut the fuck up? She got mad notes. Yo. What's He's such a kid. He's a a child. He is such a kid. Girl, stop. And she been killing that shit, man. You been doing, she got notes for the next six weeks. She got as soon as the notary show up, she shooting at you too. She shot at you with Pedro? I heard it. I heard it. Okay. We on her side though.


I did not. What do you mean? Oh, you shot. I just you definitely shot at Mark. You let it slide you shot at. I'm surprised you didn't. You usually got a little his I never shoot at Mel first. Mel always shoots at me. I just wait a episode or two and then shoot back. Smart. That is true. That is true. You just get shot at it. It just, if if it's you get shot at and it just wait with six tickets for some shit. Oh shit. Loaded. Fucking clip. All right, here we go. All right, Let's go. Big man. We, I think it was more, more windy and Oh you playing a white girl. Windy. And also I think I was over emotional and I think today I didn't really handle myself quite well mentally. I would say That's a lot of excuses.


So basically That's all I hear. That's It. I was just making it for Sarah. Like, I don't know. I have to check the statistics. I think I, she won the match. Not because she played incredible just because Simon. Oh wow. Made all Oh Damn. That's all we have to fucking hear. That's disgusting. That's all we have to hear from this disgusting, mediocre fucking white woman. The best person, woman. All you gotta say, wait, hold up. She's not a mediocre white woman. I I in this moment. Yes. The fuck she she in this moment. Yes she is. Serena was sitting on her side. What Serena was sitting on the white lady's side. Really like no, no, no, no, No, no, no. Don't, don't don't, don't act like she was sitting and felt like everything that she said was justified. That's what that sounds like you're saying. No, He saying, saying that what I'm saying he, she's physically sitting er s saying I'm saying she might have been the favorite to win the match, like I'm saying.


And yeah, I'm saying in skill is her name is her. Just to be clear, her name is Arena Sabaa. She's the number one rated women's tennis player in the world. She's not mediocre. Just for the, just For the audience sake. Okay. Sorry. Let me just, let me, let me, let me clarify her reaction. She played mediocre. Her reaction was she played me mediocre and her reaction was that of a mediocre white Local. Are they killing her? Are they killing her in the media for that? Not really, That's my question. Not really. No, they're really been, they're really playing up the white fragility and the tears and shit like that. As a matter of fact, when Coco was playing, they were chanting her name because They're in France. I get that. Well she, Oh okay. She's from Belarus. But yeah, It is the French open be what?


That that, Yeah, but it doesn't matter. I'm not making Excuses For it doesn't matter. There's like, it's not an excuse to sex an excuse there. There is like a, there's a diverse group of people playing in this, you know, in the French Open. So the fact that they were chanting Coco's name during this and this woman was playing like complete and total shit and then her bad sportsmanship when she gets up on the podium and starts talking about the fact, it's not like she played that great. It's just my fucking heirs that It is just bad Question. Sorry. Lemme go, go ahead. Saying that she played like shit. Isn't that taken away from Coco? Yeah. Yes. Like saying, 'cause you're saying that the reason why Coco won is because what's her name? No, what I'm saying Lanka played like shit.


I'm saying that Coco was the better player because she took advantage of her. Of the errors that she made. Yeah. But It Was still best. Lemme play, lemme play devil's advocate a little bit. I don't try, lemme play a little devil's advocate, a little devil's advocate because I agree you should say you're the better person. One jump. My my head's off to her, but every basketball team in the world says we beat ourselves. Right? We didn't play good basketball tonight. We can win this game. Every boxer that loses says, You know what I mean? Like better fighter won. You should definitely say that. But not every boxer, but a lot of boxers will say at the end of a fight, I could've done something. I could've done certain, but this was a winnable game. This was a winnable fight. Cool. You right.


But what they don't do is go address the other team and say it ain't like they was better though. That's what she went and did. That's and You do diminish the other person's skill. I don I don I don't like that part. Everybody, every basketball team Don't say yo, We beat ourselves. Some of them niggas be like, yo, they came out, they punch the better team shit out of it. That's true. They punch us in the mouth. I shouldn't say every, I guess I'm just saying I'm Yeah, it's not everybody. I'm I'm just saying this isn't that unprecedented for people to say. I think It is. They didn't play great. We just, we beat ourselves. This is not is normal. It is not but us but it's us. It's normal. Listen, hold on, listen. I don't wanna put it on all over the place so somebody make a point. It is not but us reporting on it as saying that she took advantage of the other girls' eras.


It is taken away from Coco in my opinion. And that's why I think you have, I agree with y'all that you have to say the better person won. Yeah. Did she played she played, although she won the first sub Lenko won in the first set and actually thought she outplayed her in the first set. But Oh, you watched it. I I only saw the first set. I actually thought she going, I thought she's gonna win the match and then she came back and lost the, the the next two. But I think, I'm just saying, I, I think sometimes sports people when they lose, especially when you're the number one player in the world, you think I can beat anybody. True. And the only person that could beat me is me. I'm just saying that's a very common mentality. Got it. True of elite athletes. That's all I'm saying. It was like Jordan. And to add to what, to what Mark is saying, like we shouldn't judge people by their worst moment.


We do though, But we shouldn't. Okay. And you say that you're a proponent of that up here. Listen, I'm with kicking, kicking shorty back in too. 'cause this is nasty. However, if you, you're asking an athlete to take the podium immediately after a game, I give a little bit of grace. Yes. And and and lemme say that Coco did too. Coco did Good Morning America. One of those shows the very next morning and said it was immediately after a loss. I didn't like what she said but I'm gonna give her the benefit of the doubt. You know what that was right there. Class professionalism, professional class. It is class. The other girl did not have for her at the great at the podium. Yo the great no better. And you've been around in sports since you were a child and they're not new here. They've been in front of podium since they were 11.


Number one rank 10 and 11 years old. They've lost before They've known the correct thing To say. I told y'all how I think they feel in France about us over. Yeah. Yeah. They don't fuck with. I'm just not sure this one is a race thing. No, it's not A race thing I'm saying I think it's just, it's bad sportsman. I Don't think, but hold on. I think that the response to her sitting up on the podium and crying and also, you know, dismissing Coco's talent and saying that, you know, she won because of my Hess has, has created a narrative where that a lot of people are latching onto and saying, oh my God, it's just the absolute cruelty to force her to speak on a podium and give a press conference directly. I such a, yeah.


After such a, you know, embarrassing loss and it's just like fragility white, fragility white, White tears and Shit like that. And it's, the response to It is definitely the Response might hundred. And what happens is that response is a reflection on cocoa regardless of what she does and what she says. I, I disagree. The second part, I don't agree. I agree with the first part. I agree with the first part. I don't agree with the second part. Right, Because I'm telling You right now, Larry Bird would've said the same shit. I spent All this time on the White Lady and said It is highlighting how dope Cocoa Jones is. Exactly. It is falling into the race baby. That's a great Coco Jones I'm having. I wish I could hear him make it. Yeah, I said, I said I think we should highlight Coco Jones being amazing and great and not talking about this, this girl.


We're falling into the race Beatty shit. Well we're Discussing Coco all aspects I'm sorry. Conversation. I'm sorry. I see I think you're saying like your, your critique, which is right, is that we're the, the media is centering this white woman and that's kind of what we're doing right Now. I will make a very good, what I think is a good comparison between this situation and Kaitlyn Clark and Angel Reese. And Angel Reese. I think it, I think it's, it's very, it's a situation that is very, that has a lot of parallels. Alright. You give your sports from spiritual healing. I'm not You are a thousand percent wrong. More race, more race based. Well tell her why Don't just say that you're Wrong because one is clearly better. Kaylin Clark is white. Kaylin Clark is by far the superior basketball player.


It is not Close. I'm talking about that Though. So when you start to go into the racism stuff, it's not even close. Like somebody is making a stretch. I think this is a stretch. I think the, the, I think that the French people don't fuck with Americans, period. White or black. They don't fuck with us. They don't like us. You know what I'm saying? It's been documented that the French don't really fuck with us. So I don't necessarily put that on a race thing. And I also think the girl could have been a asshole. It could have been another player that she lost to that was from Australia and that was white and she could have potentially said the same shit. I think she would've. But what's the parallel for you? 'cause maybe I don't, what's the parallel between Clark? I was speaking specifically just about media treatment.


I wasn't talking about their skill. That's not what, I wasn't referring to their skills at all. I I understand the power of Kaitlin Clark and, and her and, and just how incredible of a player she is. I understand that, but I'm just talking about the media reception to the two of them. I'm talking about the way that they describe Kaitlyn Clark's determination and chutzpah and, and and and competitiveness. And they don't look at those same characteristics or place those same characteristics and respect for those characteristics in Angel Reese. That's the only parallel that I am making between the two situations. Interesting. It is the media response. That's it. Well that's been a thing for I'm that Clarissa Shields, Clarissa Shield said I still don't know how I didn't win the Sportswoman of the year for BET award.


But congrats to Angel Reese and all the other nominees. I just thought accolades mattered. Shade. She's not wrong. Now that you mention it, that's wrong. No, I mean her analysis is right. I think tweeting that is dead wrong. Oh okay. Yeah. Got it. But she probably did deserve it, but yeah, you don't tweet no shit like that. And she went on, I ain't nobody saying, ain't nobody saying Angel Reese don't have accolades or she's not good. I'm saying I thought the person with the most accolades and accomplishment would win the award. I am Team Angel Reese. Yeah. I mean Angel's accolades didn't come in the last 12 months. I was So do you guys think that the reason Well, sorry, go ahead. That Angel Rees get praise because of the competition or the, the between her and Kaitlyn Clark, that whole thing that people try to build around it.


So now she's good is why she was praised. Now people try to choose a side. Like we have to choose a side. It do You think it comes from that Mark? A little bit. I mean they Had a, they've been battling since college though. That's I'm saying genuine rival and they hate each other now. Yeah. With all due respect. Do you think you get the residue of Kailyn Clark's? What I'm saying pass the fucking ball. Pass the ball. I don't want us to get caught up in the Click Beatty internet up. Yeah, I shot up already conversations. I don't know about the, let them go get it from NPR or somewhere else. Got you. Is there anything else that needs our attention? Nope. The ink is dry. Apparently on the contract.


Aaron Rogers is a stealer. Yes. That needed our attention ed as an Eagles fan, that makes me very happy. I bet it fucking does. Thank you. Enjoy your season bro. I I think ICE is overblowing this pause. He always be overblown this I think dance on the mic bro. I think this is not a bad pickup for y'all. You can't definitively say that there was somebody else out there that's better than Aaron R It's better than Mason Rudolph. Yeah, you can't, they could've got Kirk cousins baby. Oh, He's better than Aaron Ron. That would better better but, but maybe, but they trade assets for 'em so it's not the same. It's not apples To apples. I think, I think this is a good pickup for the steels.


Again. I was We ain't gotta, I don't have to rehash this. I was against all the moves. Let's leave this for 1 0 6 in sports. I don't, I don't care. I Don't care. Let's let Cam in 1 0 6 in sports. Get to this show. Have Go ahead. Got You Right man. Go ahead. It is, It is another dude who name I won't say who's in the news for cutting off his ankle monitor and pretending to do some shit.
