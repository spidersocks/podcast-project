All right. We got, we got some decent weather this time Outside is very nice. Yeah. And it hot as hell. I mean it. This feels good. It does. It was Oppressively hot can do shit. Impressively hot. I said Oppressively. Oh I was, you was impressive. Impressed by the heat. Yeah. Good. No, not at all. Not at all. This is bad. Yeah. What's up Ish? Why you gonna be here smiling for man? I'm happy to be here. Oh, me too. Me too. Me too. I asked Joe outside, where were you when one for Pee Crack came out and I said, where were you? Nigga said he was in the basement trying to figure it out.


He could say, he say it better than me, but that Shit is funny. No, that was the answer. That was it. That, that's where I was at. I was in the basement trying to find a slap. Trying to figure it out. Me, we Nitty Deus Bo, rest in peace. Bow Rest. A peace bow. Yeah, that shit had heat. The, it was heating the streets up. I was, I was slap list slap. I was slap list while my peers, every time you went outside you heard a new Audi with the windows that it's like When. you slap list hearing that. Oh, the pain shit Hit you like A gut punch. Yo dog. It's your job to compete with Coca-Cola.


You gotta go in the basement and make Red Bull. I'm mixing some shit together. You gotta go make Red Bull. You gotta go concoct acid with death. Red Bull. I'm telling you how we come up with you, right? Oh shit. Nah, I got a clip too. Oh no, I actually, I was gonna start with a funny clip, but now fucking, I gotta, I gotta kick science now. Oh man. Oh, alright. I think this is the science. I don't know. Let's see. Today's matter Of being rational is that you tend to end up in the same place as all your competitors. And the thing that I continually notice with really successful businesses is they contain an element of complete absurdity.


If you'd given a lot of rational people the job of coming up with a competitor, Coca-Cola, they would've said, well, we need a really nice tasting drink that costs less than Coke and comes in a really big container. But the biggest success in competing with Coke is Red Bull, which costs a fortune. Comes in a tiny cannon. Tastes disgusting. Okay, so, so there, there is of course, if life is to some extent a game of poker, there is this question of do I do what's sensible, which everybody else does. Or actually When I do something silly. If I do succeed, the gainers will then be disproportionate. Roll another one. Someone throw the ox.


Don't let my job attire fool you. Stir. Don't let my temp job outfit fool you. I'm here today. Whoa. She like the way I move. Like rest, Peace box, smoke, peace box, move Clap, Clap for shaft.

There Was a couple of airports that basically said do not show up unless you have a confirmed flight and you have confirmed it within the last like couple of minutes.


Do not come here. Damn. Yeah, it's back. I keep getting triggered. Right. Like, like I'm listening to y'all And. it makes me wanna say that I did see this on an episode of 24. Lot Of Reference that, but the audience fried me up for saying that I've seen every season of 24 as it relates for the attempted assassination on Donald Trump. I guess they were taking that to mean that I'm getting my news from 24. No, that's not what that mean at all. No, That's not what it means. It just means like we've seen something similar play out in a TV show. Oh, life imitates art. Art imitates life. It means that because our brains have witnessed this, whether factually or not, it's not so inconceivable because we've seen how it would be mapped out.


We do not think that 24 is a real thing. Maybe Jack b That's why I think, I mean a lot of people thought that Idiocracy was like just, you know, a movie that could never have happened. And it's, You guys have Never seen Idiocracy? No, No, no. Nope. Okay. Well it was a movie that took place. I don don't know. It came out in like I've Seen it just not in a movie. Yeah, it came, it came out in 1996. And so basically they put this guy in like this don don't know, like oxygen chamber. And he was supposed to come out like he was the most average guy on earth. And he was supposed to come out like maybe two years later there was an explosion at the plant. He comes out like 500 years later and the world has completely changed.


There's no more water. We only drink like Mountain Dew or something like that from hoses. There's garbage everywhere. Taco Bell has like won the, like the, the battle of the restaurant. So every restaurant is a Taco Bell. That's how you know is Ka. No wait. But the president, oh the president of the United States is a former UFC champion and Oh that's a fact. The shoes that everybody wears is Crocs. So basically they came up with this concept of the movie that nothing, there's nothing about this movie That would ever, ever, you know, possibly come true. And well You dudes out there that y'all listening, y'all Taco Bell Eaters Out there that's listening. You need to find the nearest toilet. You nasty sack of shit.


Hold on. Your stomach is is hurting That Taco Bell be hit sometimes. Hold, hold on. I like what You doing? I think y'all are the sc of Earth. Oh it's definitely slow. Oh no, no. That could be true. I got Taco Bell load and White Castle. Say what you want. Oh Yeah, no. Say what you want. Taco Bell hit When. you drunk at least White Castle. Well White Castle too. They all do the same thing. Taco Bell is Mexican White Castle. Yeah. They act as act as laxatives. Yes. Fuck. Clear right out Taco Bell though. Absolutely. I Wouldn't Touch that. Y'all are disgusting out there. Yeah, absolutely. Taco Bell is good. Taco So. I ain't Di. They got the little Dorito taco now too. To be Sauce. Taco Bell iss nasty as hell. And I'm not changing my tune unless you pay.


I'm not dumb. I'm not just for free. Oh. It's the best I'm there every time. But Y was saying alright, the outages flights are done, everything is fucked up. Yes, Yes. That's what we just said. This it ports are Packed. All of my thoughts are radical. So this coming two weeks or a week after the attempted assassination, I just think shit gonna get shit gonna get worse. Yeah. I think we gonna see something, something really Bad. Mascal is What Happened Soon. Yes. And don don't want be like the fearmonger. Yeah but I mean again, we, we watch enough shit to see how this has played out a a million times. Granted we haven't seen it in real time. It's like we keep living through historic moments of bullshit now.


It's true. Yeah. And I ain't telling nobody to get scared, but I mean since we all are all sharing earth, I mean we could talk about what may happen while we're here. Yeah, true. We are here. We ain't gotta be scared about it. We could be thorough when it come, but it's coming. I do think so. Whatever it is, test runs. It's something. Yeah. Yeah. They testing some shit. It's test run For sure. For sure. Now I'm too stupid to continue this, but just remember We heard it first. There You go. Yeah, there you go. Exactly what else we got? What else we got out there that they need us for? Huh? On a good weekend. On a good weekend, huh? Turn It up. Talk about some music. Turn it Up. We Can talk about music. I'm here to talk about Anything. I hate When. you do that. Anything. And then when we bring anything up, you try to, Well I'll do, I do still wanna produce some segment things.

I down can't. I'm down play. I'm down to play. I'm down to play. You gotta segment it out. Yeah. Segment It out slow, Walk it. New music. Well for me J t's album is is the one of the week for me. Yeah. Her new album Cinderella Girl dropped yesterday. I was pleasantly surprised. Yo I was, I was more than pleasantly surprised maybe because I didn't have expectations. Yeah. It could be that, you know, I, I've only known her through city Girls music. Same, you know, couple, you know, maybe a feature verse by herself.


But this album gave me old Jeezy a little bit outside of the, the Miami City Girl Raps. Yeah. There's a couple of 'em when she got to rapping. Yeah. The intros, shit, All of that. Yeah. I'm sitting here like, god damn I could hear him. Yeah. On these, on some of these verses. I wonder if he was involved. He has to have been involved but not to put it's a Goods. Yeah. Don't do that. Yeah. I'm saying don don't Do that to jt. I'm not saying writing, but again, You can just get some bounce off of somebody or some ideas. It just sounds like he, he damn near produced this. But I'm not taking anything away from her. This is a great project. But that is one of my takeaways from listening to J T's album. Is that the bounce? She slowed down the bounce.


Yeah, she Did. She did. She slowed down the bounce. I'm used to the city girl upbeat up temp Miami shit at the t. good. All of that fast shit. She didn't do, she slowed down the bounce. Her words were clear. The flow was a little slower and she clearly had something to say and She gave, that's the best part. She gave Something for everybody a little bit, but not in a pry way I guess. Right. And she didn't isolate the city girl phase. Yeah. Like she didn't leave them. No she didn't. I got records for y'all. Yeah, that's what I like. I'm gonna show you where I'm going, but I'm not gonna leave y'all behind. I'll play a little bit of the intro. Oh no, no, no. Wait a second. Oh no, I forgot. JT is on my list too.


I got a list today. What's the list? That sounded hot That she got joints on her album. Man. I'm sorry you stopped mid inch. I, I I stopped it. What's Your list? I need help from y'all today. Okay. Okay. We here. That's what we here for. Listen, this is the best thing about working with my friends. I need friend help today we got more so an hour or two. But for now, this is where I'm conflicted. JT in a promotion for her album, put out the clip of naysayers and doubters. Now I got na the shit coming and myself and Amani are in the clip.


Y'all Renee saying it. Okay. It's Amani saying, I think the city girls should no longer make music ever again. Shit. Which is why you have to be careful what you say on these microphones. I I don't know if he really feels that way, but I mean he can't, he Likes to go Outside but it don't matter. They did break up. They did So. I was just going say out make music felt the same. But When, you isolate that clip from a dude on a couch, boy it's stings bad. And then they got me saying, speaking of flopping the city girls And, it was like dot. Now I don't feel too bad about this because JT knows where my heart lies. Yeah, you said that before you Sure.


Well JT, I've, I've, I've had an exchange with recently, like in recent weeks. Okay. And our last few exchanges have been her knowing that I'm in full support of what she has going on. So that's why I'm saying that. So JT knows it, but she don't know where my heart lie enough to go in the comments and say, Hey y'all Joe is gang or to not use me in the clip. So everybody's doing what they're supposed to do. Yeah. But I did go leave a comment and say, Hey this clip makes it seem like I'm not gang clean it up. I can't that that is the Oh yeah, that's the cleanup. Yeah.


You clean up. The problem here is half of me is on the, ain't no neutral side of things today. Okay. I am, I said it a few pods ago and I'll say it again sometime when shit get thick, it's no time for a neutral. However, that's where I'm getting, that's where I'm getting fucked up in my support of the girly girls. 'cause you're trying to support all of them with the exception of two, two of y'all are, it's done, you're done with me. But the rest of them you try to support 'em all. So it's tough to even talk about the JT project without my rapper ears talking about the things I heard on the project.


I'm a fan of bitches getting Epics. Oh no, she's, she's shooting. I'm she's shooting. I'm a fan of that. She's shooting. But I don't want it to look like, because like I said, the girlies are kind of teaming up. They got their alliances, they got their allies, they got their friends, they know they enemies. So it is real easy to get jammed up in somebody not knowing where your heart lies. That's all I have until hour two now. Back to jt. 'cause this is some shit on here. It is. Still is saying bitch ain't shit change. Damn. I miss my dog. I miss their game. Moved away from home. Hoping shit change.


Still a lot of trauma. Eating at my brain. Bitch I'm still mad from 20 years ago. Wonder why my daddy gave my mama dope. Young Black and lost but never lost Hope.

I was like, Oh, I about breeze. Threw this in the car. No, I, I let that shit rock. I by the time I got to three, I said, wait, wait, wait. Let me go put the headphones on now I need to really hear this.


Yeah. Not Mad at, so she, she smoked this. Hey, just a testament to what happens When. you, you go through some real shit. You come out of it and you put your head down and you get to it through what the naysayers are saying about you. Because she wasn't exempt. She wasn't exempt. She's anything You can say about a female rapper. They said about, they said about her during the breakup, during the, the Uzi relationship. Just during all everything. Yeah. And she rerouted. And what, I'm not mad one, I'm not mad at her using y'all in, in the naysayer clip Because me neither. It's just because that's, she's treating it like motivation now. Okay, y'all said this. Let me hear what y'all say after hearing the project.


So I'm not mad at that. And two, I like the way j JT did her shit. Like she did the small venues. They killed her for it. But she played, she's growing her audience as a solo act in the way you're supposed to do it. Yeah. At least you're not canceling a bunch of fucking tours. That's My point. She could have went and tried to book some big ass theaters or arenas and now you gotta cancel. Stupid shit. Yeah. Nah. I I love everything she's doing. Me too. Me too. Broaden the appeal. Yeah. Same in a, In a way that's not goofy. Right? Couldn't agree more. Listen, congratulations to jt. I will be playing this album multiple times. You did it. Oh yeah, you did it. You got dude dudes to check it out. Word facts. You got dudes to listen. I'm happy for I am. Who else? Who else? What else we got?


I mean, Childish, Gambino drop if you're into kind of, he went a little bit more pop, a little more alternative. There's a lot of like industrial Yeezy esque sounding shit on there. There's some alternative r and b kinda stuff on there. I enjoy it personally. I wanna listen to it more before I give a in depth review. But I enjoyed it. Okay. I didn't hear it yet. I hate it. Really? I absolutely fucking hate it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I know I'm gaining a reputation as a hater. Well, fast gaining. Yeah. You've been here for a while. Yeah. I don't be that. I don't be hating. I don't, don don't feel like I be hating. It's hard to balance like being kind of a critic of music and being, not being a hater Dog.


If you spoke as much as I had to speak for a living, eventually you'd have to start telling the truth about some things. Yeah. You can't just like everything, like all of us be wanting to do, look at Burn here early. Don't come over here when the golf course close. Nigga get out. Don't come over here when it ain't nice enough to golf. Nigga. All these fucking Trump niggas want to show up. Get outta here. Get your fucking, what was I saying about, what was I saying just now? C Childish Gambino. Hold up. I, there are some songs that I like on here. I did purchase them. It's about four of 'em. Okay. Other than that really, really, really pop Don don't know if I would say it's not bubblegum pop, it's just broad spectrum pop.


I guess there's some shit that's hip hopish. There's some shit that's electronic, industrial. There's some shit that's R and Bish. There's some shit that's straight up Pop acoustic guitar and singing. I like my C Childish Gambino like this A little more fun. That's how I like my Childish Gambino. Is there any of this on there? One One Actually. Actually I'm gonna play it Called I got y'all. I coming right now. I'm coming right now. I'm coming right now. Let you go.


Oh man. Hey, What's the name of That song? Love that song. I don't know. That's a nice song. You don't know the name of the song. What Did you typed it in? Because don don't know. I know the name of the song but don don't know how to pronounce it. Ah, what is that? It's Ill Earn. That's a nice song. See this one? They was freaking the titles I always Thought that was a 3 3 3 Do earn. Yeah, But it's roman numeral so it's one, one. Listen, listen. I'm tell you, they try to get free.


You. Yeah. I like this song off the new Donald Glover. I do, I do. Okay. This is, Yeah, that sound like a little bit of that that you Just played for me. There wasn't enough of this particular style on here for me, but this is crazy. This is called Steps Beach off the new Childish Gambino, the new Donald Glover Band Stone and the New World. I'm not how we peace and quiet, but the kids do not agree.


And you swear by your that you be smarter than me. Junior, I You get the point. This is no excuses. I purchased this one. I didn't buy the intro but I do like his intro. It's a little quirky but I do like it. I like The second song too. I like, I like this album from what I heard. Yeah, but your music taste is broader than mine. It may be, it may be. This falls into the alternative kind of a lot of it. He got real alternative. Oh Yeah.


God damn. Just this the same person for Yeah, Yeah, yeah. That's talent. That's range. Yeah. For Real. This is how I like my Childish. Gambino right here on no excuses. Yeah. Let him get his bag. Let him get his fucking bisexual bag. Wait no. This song is like you taking all takers. Whoever trying to holler at the club you down. It's vital. What Else? Hey, hey, hey. Wait a minute. Hey Mel writing a note to some nigga. Oh shit.


Mel, you ain't at work. And another thing, Mel, you have to participate. I'm here Yo, I'm looking at Mel and another thing. Get that fucking pair of sweats out of my house. By the time I go, who are you writing this book to? Girl? I'm not writing a fucking book. Oh. It looked like a book. I literally was saying I'm on the pod. Leave me alone. It looked like that. In more words. It looked like that in like a little 700 word. Not fucking tell. Nigga. If you had a job you wouldn't know what it's like. Hello.


Listen, that song is Fire No Excuses off Childish. Gambino. And I'm gonna always, there's some shit on there man. I'm gonna always gravitate to the seven minute song on your album. Yeah. Hey artists out there, the Seven Minute Joints, those are for me. I wish y'all get back to it. I appreciate that for them. I like Either the seven minute joint or the three minute Joint not Yeah. I don't like the four and a half minute joint. That's just, it's over for that. Yeah, you Dragon It is over for four half In Dragon. Why? Why? Why is there a third verse that didn't? Shit, I'm glad. I'm glad we getting three minutes back. Yeah. I don't, I hate the one minute. Yeah. Yeah. Three 15. Three 15 is a blessing. It is getting 90 seconds songs man. Yeah. Yeah. I hate that shit. As soon as you get into it, the song over. So They playing with us by doing that. Yeah. You know what they doing. Yeah. But It works.


Were you able to listen to the M album yet? No. Man, you already? Yes. I listened to it and I like it man. I thought you were gonna listen To it. So I know. I saw all your tweets. You was picking it up. Oh my God was the greatest shit I ever heard. I didn said Greatest shit. But that album's hot. The album is a good album, man. you know, after I took Ice and Parks advice, I went to go listen to it And. it was good. It remind me of the early Eminem. Yeah. And then how he goes back and forth between Slim, shady and Marshall. And like if you listen to it in order it tells a story. It was great. Listen, listen. I'm not in a rush to listen to it because come on where I am musically. But also I'm not in a rush to listen to it because it's not a project that I can come on here and give my honest truth about.


No matter what I think. Why not? It's too personal because I, I, I've worked with MI love Royce too much. They have a great friendship that I wouldn't want anything I have to say to come in between it like it may have in the past. So m is m is on my list. So You have pics? No m is on my list of people that yeah, I'm, I'm cool now. It's not worth the, it's not, it's not worth the trouble that it would bring. I love. Well I think you like the album. So I think that it would probably, I'm gonna listen to it. I really wanna hear Joe's critique. I really did like, I, Well I'll tell you off air, but I mean When, I listen to it. Got it. When I. Listen to it. I'll tell you off air. But don don't want to feel obligated. Okay. To, to come in here to the public for things that are personal and have real life effects on me.


And voice means that much to me. So I. So the next a question is that if you listened to the album and didn't like it and you spoke about how you didn't like it, I wouldn't speak about how I didn't like it. So Royce would get offended. No. So why are you saying I don't understand that part? Because It could have real life effects on the people I love. Royce not getting offended don't mean that somebody else wouldn't get offended that Royce loves. Got it. It's the same thing we said about fucking Stephen. A talking about Kyrie, the people that raised you, raised him. Got you. Okay. So you talking about him don't net you nothing. You offending people that like, I don't want to offend, I don't wanna put myself in a spot to offend anybody that I have real life love for. I think today with fucking monetizing and everybody out there being a fuckety, fuck those lines are confused between Ain't no Line no people that we really, really love versus people that we just keeping up with on the internet.


And I wanna be clear in my associations with people, A lot of times though, people just clip up the parts. That's juicy, right? Because a lot of times you give, you give, that's the game. Click bait you create and then you post it. So meaning like in the pre, you'd be like, I love these people, I love y'all, I'm a supporter, but this, and then after you Will say none of that matters. We talk long form three hours Straight. I I just think it's unfair. They're not gonna clip up. They're not gonna listen to three hours and clip it up to make it advantageous to you. They're gonna take what's juicy so they can monetize and that's it. Got it true. And if you in the game, you gotta know that. So this ain't love and hip hop where I could say, Hey, they can't edit what you don't give them here. I give it to them.


They edit it up so they could make whatever they make off of it. I know the game. I'm not here to complain about it. I know what time it is. I'm one of the forefather of this shit. you know how to move. Yeah. I'm not confused by how the internet works, how people work the internet. I'm not confused by any of it. But I'm happy that m is being received. Well. I like how and m has played a very important part in my upbringing with, with some of those albums. So I'm just outta space now where I want to respect the things I have respect for. Got it. Dig well. I like, I like a record called I like Habit. I like a couple of records. I just, Shit. I'm telling you it's some, it's some deep shit on that album. Like yeah, that somebody saved me records towards the end.


It's another one that just hit you right in your chest like all Come On and it's so, it's like it's, it's telling a story so it plays through and before you know it, the album is done. Yeah. If you understand what I'm saying, you get lost in listening to it. Like you're there if you understand, I was just driving and I was listening. I'm like, oh this shit is, There's a, there's a, I mean we wasn't gonna talk about him, but there's a fan. Yeah. There wasn't on the board at all. You guys free last week If That's the second review that y'all gave me. But here we are for the third part In a row. And now I sound like a dick for saying that. No you don't. No you don't. Don like a dick. I get what you're doing doings. You're producing, you're producing, you're producing. Yeah. No, you're producing No produc. But No ain. Closing Ain Closing. Yeah, Wrap it up in closing. I was gonna say there's a fan theory going around that there's another version if you listen to the album in reverse.


Yeah. And this was also said about Kendricks damn album, which TDE then confirmed and Rereleased the album in reverse. So. I haven't done it yet. But I am gonna go back and listen from the last song up to the first and see if it got, I am never listening to an album in reverse. But anyway I'm gonna do it just because that's Weird don don't Know. Like it did work with the Well Let's do how you gave it to me. That that does sound strange. But I'm with Parks a little bit like those shows that come out where they say, Hey you'll get a different interpretation depending on how you watch it. I'd be like, y'all doing a lot. Yeah. Like I'm not gonna watch episode six and then two. But see that five. But you know what, that shit worked on me with a couple shows with the Black Mirror. Yeah. Bander Snatch Boulderer Dash or something like Bander Snatch.


Yeah. But But Marketing works on You. Yeah, it does. It works on a lot of people. But it'll it'll give me a reason to just, Hey, you know what, let me just see what y'all was saying. Lemme go try it. Yeah. you know I'm agree or I'm, I'm gonna disagree. That fucking Black Mirror shit that they tried build up under, what was the name of Bender Snatcher. I Bender snatched that shit off my screen. That shit was as shit was a mess. They got about six watches outta me. Seriously? Because I went back doing all the choices over And what was that series where it was like yellow and then Blue? Yeah, That shit was, Oh yeah. Oh that was horrible. Yeah, that Was horrible. That fucking lost me. That was that Lost Me too. Forgot. I forgot too. But that's, they robbed the Bank shit. Yeah. Money Heist some shit. Was that what it was? Something like that.

I would still just lapping it up for presumed in. No, No, no, I know. But like it's, it's such a shut off. It's such a good series that it's something to look forward to. Like Special Ops Lions.

If you wanna skip this like I do in this moment, I think or hit a reverse. You can use it. And right now I wouldn't use my skip.

She didn't feeling well. So we can't talk about Mel When. you not feeling well Pat, I promised you and I'm settle down. Well what else were we on? I don't remember. We were talking Music before that but yeah, Y'all trying to Star Trek. Stock the fuck outta here.


Star Trek. Lemme Lemme get y'all opinion. What do y'all think about leaked albums? No, I don't want hear Leaked albums. I'm asking this. Oh, albums. Yeah, because Big Sean, Big Sean's album was leaked by, I'm guessing it's a Kanye supporter that freestyle that he had the, was it On? The Radar. Yeah. The lines in there. We trying to see who the Es were to some people, myself included, took those to be Kanye es where he was saying why would I go searching for a beef? Something along those lines. And DJ a lot of people. Then DJ Head said, Hey, I spoke to Sean. He's not talking about Kendrick and his freestyle. He's speaking about another Gemini. Oh, oh Oh. This is definitely Kanye tweeted doubling down but so then a page posted it.


All right. Since he won Disc Kanye, I'm leaking this whole album. Here it goes. And he put the album out. Shit. Now the album's not done yet. It's, I think it's 14 tracks or so that came out. But I have it and I listened to it. It yeah, 14 tracks You can hear. This is not a finished project. This is not like my album was done sitting here ready to go and somebody leaked it early. There's open spaces on here, there's You can hear certain parts where he's just trying to get his flow. He's not really saying anything like he's on a beat going like how he's gonna flow over it. But I just wanted to get y'all thoughts on leaked albums don Don't see but that's a different question from what we're describing. 'cause that's not, that's not a leaked album. Yeah, that's that's somebody's just stealing.


It's not an album. It's not an album. Yeah, it's a work in progress. That's not a leaked album. So You talking about a completed leaked studio session, there's Levels. I see what you're saying. I see what you're saying. There's levels Too. I don't view that as a leaked album. But if I got, Because like you said, I stole your tweet. This is not the artist's vision. No. That's different from after master. I don't wanna be like a caveman. The CD plant you mix and master, you send it to the plant, the plant has your finished product and they serve it to the streets and now you fucked for a week or two now. Yeah. That's different than Somebody. Yeah. That's the final product than an engineer like taking your unfinished sessions and leaking them. That's leaked to music. But it's not an album.


I don't know what the artist intended with this. Yeah, that's You can, like I said, You can hear it in here. It could have been some spots for some features. There's, there's some, I could guess That would win in certain spots. Some of the records are completed. Some of that shit is hard. I'm, I'm not gonna front, but I, I wouldn't review this personally. I got Sean here replying to the rumors of Kanye or someone Kanye related being behind the odd league. Oh Please let me hear that. Projects, you know I, I've been there since graduation, you know, and I got to like study and contribute, you know give energy to every project. Eight oh eights beautiful twisted I right So I know he wouldn't do that 'cause that that's, that's trash.


I know he wouldn't do no shit like that. So whoever did do that, you know it did fuck me up. But I know like hold on, lemme show y'all So. I know he ain't do that shit 'cause I know he ain't do that. Nigga's talking about yeah did that. I know he ain't do that because look at this shit right here. He's walking to plaques. He's walking to a plaque in a very large, he see This plaque Right here house. Okay It's 185 million records sold under good music. I love good music nigga that shit that made more money off my music than I did That don't say that. That says nothing to me. don don't, I don't think that Kanye Leaked this out.


don don't think that Kanye leaked it but what he said doesn't say anything to that to me because I watched Kanye on drink Champs and I remember what Kanye said the way he talked about Big Sean in that moment. What is he say that means I don't give a fuck about this. He's up there. Yo. That was the worst decision I made. I wish I never signed him. See that headstone right there? That's big. Sean put his name there like that's not talking from a place of a person that wouldn't do something to damage you. You know I didn't, I gotta watch it. Yeah. Kanye know shit, shit know know. But did he say his reason why he don't, why, why he regretted Didn't Sean no sell records? No, he didn't get, no, he didn't get into detail. Okay. So but he made it clear. I don't fuck with him and Sean started publicly talking about his support of Trump but he was mad at Oh got it.


Okay. Okay. He was mad at that. But Sean sold records on good music. Absolutely. Yes. Absolutely. All. So it's that. Absolutely. So it had to be something else then Big Sean is one of the artists that I care about and I enjoy his music and I enjoy who he is as a person and from what I know right. I enjoy how he has put on for Detroit. My problem with Big Sean is respectfully, if you're watching Big Sean, I mean no disrespect by this is anytime my problem with him is the vagueness in which come with his thises.


That's my problem with Big Sean. Okay. That's fair. Big Sean does lyrically dis people. He does. He does. And Then, we hear it as fans and we get to guessing and in every guess we say, he says, he say you're wrong. But he don't never tell us who he dissing. Now not that he has to I don't like, but our guesses be sounding accurate to us. When, when we thought that you and Kendrick had something going on for a little while, he told me on the phone I was wrong. I thought on the phone that was ka Later it turned out Joe be right y'all artists, because of the political correctness that you have to carry your brand and your business with.


Y'all can't tell us when one of these niggas is pissing you off And. it happens more often than not. Y'all get pissed off on just who name got the bigger font on the festival flyer. You want me to come here and talk about all the things that really piss y'all artists off? That's True. That is a fact. You niggas hate each other. And this message to me sound like somebody That would have reason to not really look at that side with the gr the greatest Delights. I sold all of these records. Y'all made mon more money off it than me. You probably didn't gimme the easiest time when we was trying to figure out the split and, and we haven't appeared to be very close since then.


Appeared. I don't know anybody's business and I'm not speaking to moles. I have a a life. We'll get to that later. So that's my only problem with Big Sean. Is that all right Big Sean, you said you're not talking about Kendrick. Cool. Take you at your word. Now we think you're talking about Kanye and he's on record saying I'm not talking about Kanye. I love Kanye. I sold records with Kanye. Well then who the fuck is he saying that he said that? Or is he saying no, I don't think Kanye leaked my Shit. No, no. And and something else he's saying I'm not talking about Kanye in the song. I love Kanye. Gotcha. Okay well then now you fucked us up and we don't know what to do.


That's my only problem with, with Shawn and the dis, It didn't sound like he was talking to either of 'em to me. I mean doesn't it sound like he was talking to someone in his circle? He said Something About this hiphop. Do we gonna try to figure out who you talking about? If it sounds, are you talking about somebody? That's all that's game. It's not personal to to to Sean or anybody else. We are nosy, inquisitive fans who love this shit and love the beef of it. So if we hear it, Yeah you start putting shit out, people are gonna start. Yeah come on man. I love Sean. I do like, I will say I like how he responding to this though. He put a tweet up and he was like, I might as well start dropping before they leak it all. I like that Alchemist Shit. He got big Sean Alchemist joint. That shit's and then he already announced the album release date August 9th, three weeks from now.


Okay. Oh I like that Better Me than you. So he's like Yo, he put the pre save up already. He's like all right fuck it. If y'all doing this, let's go. Yeah. Hurry up Point before they start this fucking Kendrick Drake shit up again. Get your shit off man. I want to hear a Big Sean project. Me too. I do. Poor Sean Got fucking and the brunt of everything in this this year And now can't even escape the ghost of Kendrick. 'cause I put out a freestyle and y'all are telling me I'm dissing him. It's like damn these niggas stop beefing and I'm still in the middle of this fans Sitting here going making jokes. Talking about up August 9th. We know when Kendrick dropping now. Like You know every time something happens. Yeah But Yo Kendrick, let me tell you something. Kendrick DJ head and anybody else on the west coast, that'll be a real asshole move and don't do that At all.


don don't think they would do that. Let's Sean get a a couple weeks off man And Sean whenever you ready bro. The streets Kent use another 28. Eight. Like I know I can because Kendrick is gonna drop an album. Kendrick don't do that. That would fucking suck. Don't drop nothing then Yo. What a dick. Don't drop anything. But what was that date that kept popping up in the not like us video wasn't it eighth Eighth. Eight. Eight. Yeah. Eight. Eight. So If, if everybody's, Oh my God. But if that's the case, why would Sean willingly pick that date and Remember When I talk about the jacket. The person that made the jacket did reach out. Like that's his brand name. Like that August 8th. That's part of his brand.


It's now he Could good for him but he could have still that was irrelevant to our Point. I know he could have still Used it for time. Our point is that diabolical nigga picked something with that date on it 'cause he is doing something that date. Not that the the date was customized on, on the jacket. Got it. I would hate that Yo Big Sean. If Kendrick is doing that run. Yeah. Nah. If Nah, what if Kendrick is doing that, Sean can't play the, I'm not talking about him. I don't have no beef, no issues no more. This is clear line in sand shit. You gotta go Attack. Not necessarily. See that's when fans start hyping shit up. I'm bro this you really coulda just liked that date based off the timeline of what was happening with like that and not like us.


And my album being I like the eighth, I'm big enough artist to pick. I'm a big enough artist to wear a date. I like I'm taking it. That has nothing to Do with that. Don't mean I'm beefing with Big Sean because He did that shit before. If he, if he and Did and if that's his date and he picked a date before Sean's album got leaked. I'm mean That's what I was just about to say. Cool. He cannot know that the likes of Big Sean would be trying to drop on the same day as him. Sean. I think respectfully and with love, if that's what's happening, should get in front of it or behind it. Pause. I agree. Get Away from it. That's all I'm saying. Get away from it. That's it. It's not to be And that's The bad part because you don't know when Kendrick is dropping.


Like it ain't like he, that's the bad part. Yo All these niggas can make a phone call and find out some shit. Big Sean ain't gotta call Kendrick but this industry is this big and Sean up Artist so he Can get in touch with somebody. you know, Hey call somebody and just get a quick temp check real quick. What is looking like that first week August? Second week August? What we looking like? Yeah, I'm running from that. Yeah. As soon as a rumor come out that that nigga's Dr. Kendrick dropped on the eighth. I'm outta here and what looked like it might be your biggest selling album and I want and I just bust my ass for eight months show. I've been working for years. Yeah. Nah, you ain't stepping on my shit. That's the problem with music Uhuh. What else we Got anyway? I don't like listening to leak albums though.


Or leak demos. I don't wanna hear any of this shit. I, I'll listen. I just won't hold it to anything. I don't wanna hear none Of that shit. Like I'll just listen. Just, just, I just wanna hear where you're going but I won't if I, if I hate it I won't even hold it against the artist or nothing. 'cause I wasn't supposed to hear this. That blast album was tough actually today was a blast morning for me. Okay. Okay. I saw you broke it up in fives. Like how Don Tyler? Yeah. Confused the fuck out of me as I was looking at the track. I didn't know what was going on. Yeah I don't, I don't understand that but whatever. But the first five good five to start with. Okay. I'm glad he finally dropped. I've been waiting for Blast didn didn't get to run that. I was on other album but Yeah, shout to blast another friend of the show.


Yeah, for sure. Let me see, let me see what else. What Else y'all think about this Schoolboy Q Toronto situation. For those who don't know, Schoolboy Q had a show in Toronto. It was canceled. He went on to say that the Canadian police are won't allow any TDE artists to perform there. They went on to show that Drake actually owned the venue where the show was supposed to be held at. I think that's a little bold. Don don't know what to believe anymore owned Or had ties to Owned. He was an owner in that, in that he, I forget the, I'll find the name of it. It was or is.


I think he still is. But anyway, what do you think about artists like blocking you from performing if that is What Happened Of course we don't like it. It's, it's a, it is a, in my opinion, it's a few things. We're just seen Rick Ross get punched in the face that could have resulted in somebody dying. you know what I'm saying? So if you are the police, this person is down with an opposing crew of the biggest artist in Canada history, you kind of want to alleviate the potential for that to take place. So I don't know. It could have been a police decision or the police like at what? I don't know and this is the bad part about the internet. A letter comes out could be completely fake but it's them saying we had no, we didn't blocking the show take It all with a grain of salt.


Yeah, I saw the letter but it was from a page that said like Aubrey's Defender or something like that. I was like, I don't know if this is real. I exactly. I don't know what's going on here. That's where we are now. Yeah Because if something happened to somebody, we would definitely be looking like Yo. Why would they even let The show on? I understand every scenario. I mean don don't really have to know the truth. Yeah. If they stopped him at customs or the border because of a potential threat, I understand that if they was letting him in and Drake made the call or somebody OVO made the call to say Hey did that, I understand that. I, I understand it either way He comes with the territory And I also understand school boys point of view which was hey Top was just with Baby and Slim at the YouTube party and Wayne and Wayne party was just in LA moving around.


No problems. Like it's over. Yeah, right. Nobody's trying to escalate this into something. It's not. He said like Battle I should be able to go to Canada and get my money but if not, then you open the door to a dangerous game. Which is what he said in so many words. Was Q making it seem like he was in Canada and found out it was canceled or he hadn't even made It? He didn't specify which way he just said it was. It wasn't for They canceled it, The show canceled that. That sounded, I've seen that happen. Knew that before. I should. I seen that happen in Jersey with certain artists where the police will say no you're not coming here. I seen that as well. Who's here? You're not coming here. That show's canceled. I've seen That as well in New York. Hit by police shuts down a lot of clubs or shut down a lot of appearances.


So I've seen that And to correct, you're right. He doesn't own the venue. Live Nation Canada owns the venue but he designed it and he was in partnership with them. So yeah he has ties to, He has ties to the venue. The venue is called History. That's the name of it. It's the side effects of fucking a a beef that's magnitude man. Unfortunately. Yeah. What do you think is gonna happen going against Drake and trying to do something in Toronto? That's what I don't understand. Right. He is like damn near part of the g and p for them now. Yeah his, his standing in Toronto is different from any artist from LA standing in LA 'cause LA is more of a global city I think than Toronto in terms of the amount of artists that are gonna be coming in and out of there.


I Agree. And one person's, He might be bigger, bigger than any artist independently in the world with regards to what he means for that particular country or that particular town. I agree. I agree. you know what I'm saying. I agree. Like you could take the biggest New York artist and that New York Angels moving and shaking with them. Right. Like they're moving and shaking with him. Correct. That's a lot of power. Still gotta flood. Dig ain't stop God Get a mop. How about that? With all your power. Get a get a mop insurance check. You Powerful. Niggas get floods too. Y ain't check will be crazy. Huh? The insurance check gonna be nuts.


Flood. What? I heard you ain't have insurance. I bet. Yeah, I bet. I bet. When the last time you got an insurance check?

I can't say yes you could Said you gave 'em something big over there and you went in there and they was like we got 2,500 available for you right now. I Don don't know What you talking about. Chase was trying to play with us and then you made another phone call. You probably tried to call another branch or something but yeah now they held your money too the other day you ain't exempt. Yeah. Nice check. You got they ain't clear at all. He was mad on the bathroom. don don't remember. He was mad. No, I remember because it must have been a wire like damn nigga wasn't a 60 piece.

Could be. Yeah. What else, what else, what else? What else we got? I got a question. Shoot. What's up serious? It's cancer For Melon. They're not hip hop in here. They not hip hop in here. I thought this was the music part. I'm sorry. Nevermind. Now my question to you both is that I noticed is having somebody younger than you with a pulverizing personality, does it get annoying sometimes?


Pulverizing or Pul Pulver? Same thing. Same thing. Both of them. Does it get annoying? Because I know like if I say something you be making a face, it's like oh man what? And same thing with you, y'all make these faces So I like should there be a time and place and can you guys only take me in doses? Yes. It should be a time On the pause because I know behind the scenes you knew my man. But the Thanksgiving can Hold on. Hold, Hold on, hold on, hold on. Nigga. I'm talking to the two people who are up there in Age. Hey Chucky cheese. Oh I about to name the time. I wanna know like can like the character, can you only take in a dose? 'cause it sometimes you be like Yo flip like No I think, I think sometimes you, you od you don't really od with me often.


But I could give you an example. you know I'm the example guy. Mel told you last po, she wanted you not to talk about something. I almost set it just Now. You asked her 50 times Yo. Can I talk about it? She said no. 57 times. You still talked About it. Did I? Yes, Absolutely. Yeah you did. Absolutely. And forced it. Yes. Okay. So. I would say That would be where my face. So if I'm Looking at you with the face like Yo my nigga, you asked the lady, They talk about off mic about you. Okay. I can see That they talk about it. I have not talked to Mel off. He can't Give it up, but they, that's not true. Oh, okay. I can see it. That's not true. I can hear it was frustrated with you. I just wanna make sure. Okay. So. I shut. Mel Shut up. She called HR Shut Stop lying. And that never happens Because hr, this is hr.


Oh Because I see, I see, I see a lot with you. It she be like, because I watch you my man. So we be laughing and people be like, oh come on flip. So I'm like, damn man. It's like Fam, if somebody say Yo, can I talk about something that happened to you personally off mic and they give you a answer? No, you going still fall. What? I'm supposed to look at you like Yo chill my nigga. I, that's what I wanted to make. That make sense? It does. It does. All right. Make sure we on the same, same page. That's all. So would you continue to do that now that they've said that He shook a Mel, he ain't even say nothing to Mel you. Right? I can't, I can't say nothing to Mel because Mel said that. That's where her frustration comes from. And Oh she said that too. She just whispered. Yeah. That's where my frustration comes from. Oh, she just said that. Are are you pandering to the audience or you genuinely feel this way?


Because you know, you my girl, we here. No, I definitely feel that way. You black. I definitely, I think I gave You grace like a thousand percent. You gave me grace by like talking about something I asked you not to talk about. I could have You, yes. There's a bunch of things that you could have done. Nah, you're right. I would think that. But she's telling you where the boundary, That's peace. That's peace. You could have crossed it more and then, but that is a flip thing. He likes to cross it as far as he could cross it. Homie. Homie don't let it go. It definitely is Don. And then When, you get upset. When, you feel like I'm not in these Twitter streets, you know, defending you. I'm just like, but you continuously do it. So if I defend you once and then you do it again, then what would you, what would you like the response to be? I don't think you Real question. Honestly. I don't think it's in you to defend anyone.


Me personally. It's not an insult. I just don't think that's your bag. You're not a person to defend anyone. But I do understand and I do kind of, I just wanna take heed to everyone's boundaries. And I want to be able to, I want be able to be. No I do. I do. I do know you though. It's a new me. You don't vow. I have a question for you. 'cause I believe him. I'll take him at his word. But I have a question for You. I vow not the curse fans out for the whole rest of the year. Like I'm on some new good shit. Do you think it takes a year and a half to two years to learn people's boundaries? No. Okay. All that. All that. All that I do is intentional. And for this. Now if you're telling me to stop that, you know you You can make the calls, then I could Well anything, anything. I want you to stop. I pull you in my office and tell you I don't publicly do it.


True. But you know, everything I do is for this. But they all correct. They direct like Yo flip. Huh? Well, not everybody. Well for which one? Which one? Which One? I will never say. Why did you say it nigga? 'cause of who I am today. I would never say you were saying It. Nah. It's a difference between knowing somebody boundary and respecting their boundary. True. That's really what it, what it boils down to. Because you knew her boundary. She made it clear, I don't wanna talk about this. No, you was like, fuck that. I still wanna talk about it 'cause Content here. Here's how I look at it and we can move on in closing. I look at it as sometimes she comes here, my sister and initially, you know when it was hard for her to adjust like myself, we helped each other. I look at it sometimes she come here and she's going through something. I just say things to make it about her and I just to get her in her bag.


That's it. It's just like a, it's like putting starter fluid. It's not intentional at all, but But starter fluid is very intentional. No, no, no. I It's combustible. I can't, I'm sorry. I was trying, I'm trying this one, you Start a flu. you know what I'm saying though? If she's quiet or she's saying something or if she's going through something. I don't think this is specific to you. ml. I think this is a you thing. You do this to everybody. That was the conversation we had before. You talking about boundary crossing? Yeah. Yes. I don. I don't think it's just about male. So That's what we went at it over Right Boundary. Okay. I'm just saying I that's Your bad. But I wanna do better. But I know that you're dynamic. So I gotta take some of the shit with the, with the popery. Nah, but But not necessarily.


No, no, no. But if it's, if it's, oh shit. If it's, if it's affecting, not affecting. But if it bothers that rapper break. If it bothers the workplace, we have to do good.

Don't you are that friend to me. I watch your compli. That's God You're compliments are insults. So yesterday, couple haircut appointments, mani-pedi face, you know what I mean? So I'm running around, I'm also still trying to pick out paints. Me and the paint guy at the Ace hardware that Ish told me I shouldn't go to have really gotten close Shout disease. That's my man. What a help. I got an accountant there.


He pulled me up. Lemme see I, well hey Joe. Like I've been in there for every day for like a month and a half. It's Funny, he told me I shouldn't go there, but that's my man. They not gonna help me really? In the money spots. Oh, I went to Sherwin Williams too. And what's her name? Somewhere around your part of town. They ain't really gonna help me over there. Not like they do. They Ain't no pumping up. Maybe, maybe. But somewhere around the one o'clock time I'm going from my bedroom to my Keurig. And because I like brain exercises I need or because I have A-D-H-D-I need something on at all times.


So, I, go to the Keurig with my favorite coffee cup. I put it in there, I load it up and I pull out my phone and I see that Cardi B is in the spaces and she's not always in spaces for me. When she's in spaces, she got something to say, So. I, click it. And. it was early in the space so she was slowly walking the dog, but she was getting at somebody. Did you go in anonymously? As you step on me. Mel. Sorry, step on me. Mel. I feel like that's important step on me, right this second. Mel, I feel like it's important. Clear the fuck out the paint. Stomach ache. Lady.


Were you anonymous or you I was anonymous. Okay, thank you. That's important to this story. You left that part out. I'm helping you. I was anonymous. It's a nice feature. Go on. He was anonymous. Yo, shout out to the anonymous listeners. Yeah, I love that. And I wish Clubhouse would implement it too. Anywhere that You can do Avo vote, audio, voice chat type of thing. I like anonymous. I'm such a polarizing presence that people do change. When, I come around. It's happened for majority of my life. I wanna let people be themselves. So I'm anonymous in there. Okay, go to the fridge and get my creamer.


And she is turning up on some nigga, nigga she is in there like, yeah, you motherfuckers think you know me and y'all don't know I shit. And this nigga keep disrespecting nigga. I poured that creamer and said, Ooh, right on time. Ooh we, I caught him. I'm early in the space. Sip, Sip. But she not saying a name, she just keep going. And I used to love this nigga. I'm sipping Mais saying Ooh, somebody is about to get it. I'm staying on and she keep going off but she's being a little vague.


So I, get in my car. I'm keeping this on, on my way to my second haircut appointment. It's like one 30 Ish and When I get in the car and she say this nigga, I known him for a long time and such and such and such, but she's not given the name So. I had had enough at that point. So, I'm about to leave the spaces. And then she said, I know, can't nobody ever say nothing about me because I keep my circle smaller than my, my pussy and my asshole and I never been fucked in my asshole. So my asshole is small. And I thought that that was such a genius bar.


I said, oh that's a double under your asshole is her circle is I gotta stick around, I gotta stay. Once she said that, I stayed there and she said I only work with Johnny. These the people I speak to with the label you name start naming the big wigs. If it ain't Julie, Craig, Kaiser, Brooklyn, Johnny Salu, Brooke with Johnny. If it ain't the stylist, I talk about the gossip way. None of them know my business. So she's going off and I am glued to this shit to see who she talking about. And then she said, and I did, I think this nigga hate Dominican girls and like that could apply if you're being shady, but I don't think it applies.


So let me just go get my hair. Then she said, yeah, I think Tahari didn't really fucked him up. I said, ah Fool. So. I Good for your fucking ass nigga. Good for Joe button. You ever go to get some tea and it's yours Yo Yo Shit. My heart's come to the floor. Holy shit.


And then she just start kept turning it up. She kept turning it up. Oh my God. But she's so great at what you done. It really was a great read And. it was really entertaining and no, I am about to go on a little ran. I want to start this with when Cardi said a lot, man, I wanna start this with Cardi is on my list of people that I'm going to love no matter what as a musician, just in terms of story of someone from New York, there's absolutely nothing that Cardi B could get me to say negatively about her, her husband or her family.


So. I did go back and listen to the last pod. If I've ever made a joke that has offended Cardi B, I'm sorry I am. I tweeted that and I mean it. It's part of growing up and being responsible and accountable. But some of that shit, man, don don't know. Cardi thinks that I have been unsupported for two years straight. She said that she challenged anybody out there to find negative comments. I mean to find positive comments of me toward her in the past two years.


I have grace in this instance because When, you are that famous and that busy. I don't expect you to hear every podcast. I expect you to be a part of clip culture and people sending you clips. But I totally disagree with that. They're gonna call me a gaslight. But shit, one of those years she killed everybody on every feature and we came in here for that year. I wanna highlight the two years she mentioned that first year she smoked everybody's boots on every record and we came in here and said that, I want to say for at least six months outta that year, she was not to be toyed, toyed with she ca that year off, I want to say with the offset feature, which I came in here and said she cleaned up the very last podcast without hearing a word.


I said, Hey Rob 49 and Cardi B is dropping on Friday and without hearing anything We know what that's gonna do and We know what that's gonna be. I did say that right. I also said during my Twitter rant where I was defending my honor and my good name that I would never for the rest of Cardi B at the time I said that lady that was a little shady and she heard me say it. She like that lady. Why Is that lady? I did say on Twitter that for the rest of card's career I would be done speaking about her. Whether it be music related or non-music related.


Now that I've gotten some rest and I'm well nourished, I'm here to tell you the lie detector has determined it was a lie. It was a lie. I'm gonna cover her. Yep. I'm gonna keep covering her. I can't let people suppress my voice or strip me of it and and Right. Let me just say, 'cause she said I compare the bitches. I do think that Kaboom, Kaboom. I do think that Nikki and Cardi are the bar So. I don't mean for anybody to take offense. When I compare. I just think that they are the bar.


But I'm still team Cardi. Even though I got kicked outta party game. Also like I told y'all, Rich nigga Rob, with all due respect, I'm just gonna get to the card race real quick. No Rob, my man. But I think that the topic is, we know what he about to do. Hold up.


Here we go. Stop me right there on that money on my feet. I be hopping like a bunny freak. Set me out. You see me get disgusting. I be sucking dick scratch when it soft, when it scummy. God bless her. I love cardio. I love Cardi man. I only am, I only don't love her when she's dissing me on spaces in front of 12,000 people and I don even love her then like she was like, these motherfuckers say I'm spiraling you fucking right. I'm a curly fry. She was going, I love that shit. Yo. How can you be mad at it? Curly fries, Spider. Tell what these motherfuckers saying, I'm low vibrational you.


Right? I'm a whole plate of barbecue chicken bitch that had me dying. She said that Yo, even if I wanted to play like I was mad. I can't be mad. I love Cardi. I'm New York. I got New York bias even though a few pods ago I said I don't have New York bias. we know you do. What do you want from me? Hey, fuck that. The south got south bias. The west got west bias. Yeah, I'm biased. Back to my bias. Oh she says soft. The Gummy from the gummy from scratch. Especially right there. Oh my God. Let me let that run back right quick. Like a gummy Scratch. When soft, when Gummy, when yummy. When is the gummy yummy On tummy?


Oh, that's where they going On money. On money on the money. Don't no. Put that money on me like that nigga. You. Oh, come on, come on. Big card. Hell not talk about Cardi. Hellman not talking about card. Hell not talk about You can always talk about how not talk about When. you fire like that. You never, I love this shit. I'm a bird talk ka Ka ka for my nails for me. What do When you push nail on Get turn me up and pop that pus for me.


Turn around Jordan. Okay Yo. Come on man. Come on man. Mikey, how y'all want me to not talk about it? Cardi, how you want me to not talk about you? I love you. Can't stop it. I love you. I'm sorry. Can't stop it. Back to my fucking love for Cardi. Let me finish this shit. Goddamn. Also, not even two months ago, Cardi verse Bia came up and I wouldn't even entertain it from y'all niggas facts. I wouldn't even dignify Bia and Cardi anything. I said that Bia would have a long day. I don't give a fuck. Who is writing for Cardi Bia is gonna have a long day, right?


Yes. I also challenge anybody out there I think that I I I challenge you to find a straight man in America that has said one fish, two fish, old bitch, new bitch. None of y'all bitch is not going to do shit more than me. Okay? No nigga silence that other record bongos.


I was the only person to like it in here. Everybody said as far as a single, I don't know about that. We're gonna need more. I said I'm not all the way mad at this. I think that beat is hard. She's doing what the girlies do and I want to give it some time. Every glow realer of remix the same. I'm asking where has all of the negative talk to Cardi from me? Where has that been? I know that artists are sensitive. If I listen, if I said anything jokingly, like the last part we got into living with your unemployed girlfriend and wanting her to get out.


Like that's just funny to me. Cardi said that that I said something about her. Some relationship issues that she was having was A Rollout. A cons. Yeah. A part of a rollout or some marketing shit. I know my memory is bad. I don't ever remember saying that if I said that I apologized. I don't remember saying that. I actually remember me being on the exact opposite side of I. I wanna say that that was your rollout playing like everything.


The raw I think she might be doing is 'cause some other album dropping. I was saying no motherfuckers be going through real life shit as an artist, as a former artist, some of this shit I don't look at as rollout. Especially when you're going through either marital things or anything with your significant other or your children. I just don't think it's rollout. I think I argued against that. I think I have to go back and and listen. So again, if I have said something that was outta pocket or outta place, I do want to apologize to Cardi because that's important and I'm working on myself and I want to be accountable and mature and you can't crash out with a girl and you shouldn't crash out with somebody that you respect and admire.


So. I want to say that and I'm in total support of her family. I want to say that. Is that all I have to say about Thera? Oh no, she said more. I also want to make clear that I have never done coke or crack. Only because people have huge platforms and loud voices and some of y'all out there may think it's the truth. I have never done that. I was a dust in my teenage years. Pills in my adult years kind of guy. But not to knock anybody out there, we don't shame that way.


Cardi also said that I got two lap dances from her many years ago. Cardi is a wife. So, I don't even feel comfortable discussing that. But if that happened, I do not remember. And they were not memorable dances. They were like the dances that you give like out of pity. I'm not trying to be funny as part of why I admire Cardi. I didn't look at her in the strip club and think that's someone that's having a blast.


Anytime I was there, she had to work for the money. So. I don't view her that way. I've never looked at her that way in all of her beauty. That's just not where I So. I don't remember the lap dance. I'm mad that she remembers a lap dance if it happened. What else do I need to address with car? What She had to work for the money. She worked hard in strip clubs. I remember anytime I was there, Cardi worked hard. Her and that little skinned girl, everybody went to fuck with the curly hair. Like Cardi was like, to me, I felt overshadowed in New York strip clubs.


Okay. Like she wasn't one of the IT people to me in my experience. So she pivoted And, it worked and she pivoted and she went from that to tv. From TV to music. And it's been seamless and flawless since there. Cardi also says that I am unfair and oh, and if you're confused as to why this brand has taken place, Cardi B went on Twitter's spaces a couple of days ago and just absolutely let me have, yes, it cursed me, smooth the fuck out for hours, cursed me, smooth the fuck out for some hours. Eventually Mel, once I learned it was me, I got off anonymous. I went in there as me, Okay, I don't hide in a noms.


I faced the smoke. She didn't bring me to this stage. Damn. And When I hit the request. It said maximum maximum amount of requests. So we can't, we can't have you. Damn. I mean it didn't matter. We're still entertaining Yo. I mean we're still entertaining. So yeah, I I hope I was able to clear up, clear up any of the misconceptions. Oh, she also said that because of my relationship or interviews that I've done with Nicki Minaj, that I might have turned it up on my criticism of her.


I think that's the furthest thing from the truth. I'm too real of a nigga to ever bend that way for any of these musical artists. But I do understand how it could look that way from her perspective. I think that's whack. I the only, I think I got it. I'm sorry. I think that's whack. The problem with that is that I'm so New York, New York, New York, it just so happens that, I mean they both are New York, So I try to stay as neutral as You can be when it comes to that. I can assure you that Nicki Minaj has never spoken to me about Cardi B. And I have never spoken to Nicki Minaj about Cardi B. Nor do I expect for Nicki's relationship with me to change because I don't have a problem with Cardi b.


I just think that's fuck nigga shit. I think Nikki feels the same 'cause she's very queen. She's very New York and card's, very New York. So that was hurtful. Y'all were saying. I was saying, just looking at it from her perspective, you do the interviews with Nikki and Natasha k interview. 'cause she did mention that in the space she, even though it never came out, there were pictures, there was talk about it. We people know it existed. And it Happened and she was bought and she expressed being bothered about that bef at that time too. Yes. So just from her angle, okay, this guy's doing this Her angle. I totally understand it. Okay. Her angle don't have to be explained to me because I get it. I came in here and said it before I went to Summer Jam before when Cardi was headlining, I left before the Cardi set.


That couldn't look away. That Could look away. Yeah, I left because I'm famous and traffic and human trying to get the fuck out and introvert I'm trying to leave. But if you, Cardi, I understand it. Natasha k interview. I was just trying to do like a edgy interview and not really talk about Cardi too much. And like Cardi said, in that spaces, Cardi, you are absolutely right. Taja K is a dirty, rotten bitch. Sometimes you have to meet people and see how they behave afterward to learn that they are dirty, rotten pieces of shit. You are right. But I didn't put it out. I told Cardi that in The, I did not put that interview out in The voice note.


I said that 'cause I, because I fuck with Cardi. Then she had And because it just looks Away. Wasn't it around the same time Bongo was coming out or something was coming out and you was like, I don? Yeah, she had just put out a single, I remember. And I told her I Thought that that would've looked nuts. I said, he never talked bad About you. So. I scrapped that shit and got my back kicked in by Tasha K took the hits because I scrapped it. But I don't care. Like that just seemed like the real nigga thing to do. So you do that. But I understand her point of view with that Since your feelings were being hurt. How did you feel when she said that you quit on music? How did that make you feel? Because I know your passion about your career.


Well, I went through all of these different feelings. Okay? I, And then I went to try to take, I did go and try to take like an ax some Aleve. I wanted to Aleve something like I did try to, and I tried to take some melatonin, some sleeping pills at One 30 in the morning or afternoon? No, no, by, by, by this time. 'cause I done went to the barber. I walked in, clue was in the barber. So clue now he had car to be cursing me out fucking, now I leave the barber, the barber who ain't ever on spaces, put the spaces up while I'm on the way out the door so You can finish hearing car to be cursing me out as I walk out. So it's cool. So now I get back in the car.


So at about six I tried to go to sleep early. When, I thought it was done. And I had a little bit of trouble. I had some trouble sleeping because I, Well no, before I say that, before I say that, like she used some words toward me. Like I give backhanded compliments. Like I'm, she said I'm passive aggressive. I say that I love people but then I act shady. And she's not, she's not the first person to mention that. And where there's smoke is there's normally fire. And because I've been through some, some therapy, like I'll look myself in the mirror.


I'll have the harsh look. If enough people are saying the same exact thing about you, then you do have to muster up the courage to look each one of them in the face and say, y'all don't know what the fuck you talking about. And maybe throw a SMD in there. That's what the therapist says, right? Don't take that advice. Flip So. I took some melatonin to try to get some sleep. But I couldn't sleep 'cause I had this question that was irking my mind. And it was, who the fuck do y'all be talking to out there?


Hold up now. Hold up. Hold up man. Yeah. Huh. Okay. Get your shit off. Stop. Thank you. I see that there are some narratives that people that are really famous have been trying to spend and I don't like any of it. And I can't figure out who the fuck some of y'all think y'all are referring to. Honestly. Y'all made me look up the word quit and then y'all made me look up the word retired So. I. Want to be clear? 'cause there's some people out there that just know me from Podding.


There's some people out there that just know me from blogs. I want to reintroduce myself to some of you out there. That's why I have my court clothes on. Some of y'all out there think that we are like peers. The quit narrative is lazy. It's lazy, it's unfounded, it's without basis. It is uneducated. Joseph Button retired from music, retired, my services were rendered. I did it at every level.


You want to name from mixtape to the digital wave to independent releases, to being on good terms with your major, to being on bad terms with your major, to getting a nice bag from publishing to try to fight your way outta publishing for 17 years to from new label heads coming in to old label heads going out. I've done this on every level. I have 17 projects out there, both solo and group 17 full length projects. That's When. you had to have a third verse. I am positive that there are over 300,000 bars of mine to go out there.


Listen to, to listen to. And please be clear, I retired as a better rapper than 97% of all of you. Each and every one of you. It is a small group of names that When I. Put this mic down. I felt y'all were better rappers than me. I'm not talking about artists, I'm talking about rappers. And on the artist front. Listen, I'll take my BET award, I'll take my vibe award. I'll take my Grammy nomination slash nominations and be fine.


But y'all niggas out there that keep trying to manipulate truth, y'all niggas out there that keep trying to rewrite history Joe Button didn't quit anything. I did it when it was good. I did it when it was bad. And then I left the Ponzi scheme. And y'all people that continue to be puppets, pawns, and peons of said Ponzi scheme, just want to come at me a certain way. Uhuh, I left to go figure out a way to make my voice slash instrument be a little more powerful than what it was being utilized as. Some of y'all might not know that about me.


You might get all your Joe information from the shade room. So if you're young enough or just unaware, just know that my pen is respected enough and Cardi B said that this rant is not directed toward Cardi B. I wanna be clear, she may have inspired it, but it's, I'm not talking to her. But she did say, Hey, that nigga's nice and he's good at what he does and that's why it hurts So I understand that. But just know most of these niggas watch how they speak to me because they already know what my pen does when it comes to this. When it comes to this thing here, I'm one of the forefathers of the digital revolution that we're seeing here.


I'm one of the people with master level foresight and intuition. You don't get this far without that independently. I mean, I don't want to keep padding myself on the back here, but I just thought that we needed to find a way to quantify it. So let me help you guys I me slash we sell more than most of the artists out there that listen to me per month silence. In case you were wondering why I have on the shirt, some of y'all are thinking that we are the same and we are not per as in every, every as in each, and each as in all, all of the most eye drop and move more than most of y'all.


So When I, when it's time to talk music, I very rarely speak to the musicians because you musicians are puppets, pets and pawns. And Sensitive. And sensitive. I like to speak to the label people 'cause they usually know a little more about what's happening with the delivery and execution of a product. But all of that, he quit. He quit, he quit. No, no, no, no, no, No, No, no. I will not continue to let you misguide the public. Public. Each one of us, me, them, and artists are all drivers of inventory.


Don't be fooled by what that inventory might be. We're just drivers of inventory. We are gonna go to the BET awards. They're gonna get all the money from the fucking medical lab people and all of the people and they'll fucking bring it back. We are gonna make a little song and they're gonna put us in front of Popeye's or anywhere else. Listen, don't try to knock me for making a pivot much like Cardi B did. When I was unfulfilled. Y'all be wanting to see me continue to look and feel unfulfilled. Unfulfilled. And that's Kat. If y'all want more slap from Joe, just say that baby.


Hold up. Now all you niggas, that's like Yo. You put the pin down Yo, that's fucked on want to hit. So just say that. But all of that manipulating people to think that something was a farce or a failure. I just wanna let you know you're reading the tea leaves the wrong way. That's peace. Clear. Okay. Yo. Mel is so cute. Mel is so cute. Yo. Imagine if I didn't come in here and address shit that was out there publicly that they was waiting on us to dress. Oh, I mean sometimes we do and sometimes we don't.


Sometimes you feel like a nut sometimes you don't. We'll talk when that little tummy ache leaves. Okay, little tummy ache. Yo girls got it. Good. Yo. Boundaries. Ish girls. Got it. Good. I ain't gonna lie. You teaching me how to do it? Okay, When. I die. I'm coming back with some girl privilege. Okay, look up and do that. Yo. Who was that? Where was at? Oh yeah. Who the fuck do y'all be talking to out out there? No Deadass. Sorry. Look at my cast. Come on. What? What's up? I'm letting you cook man. No, listen, listen, listen. I give grace because unlike many of you fucking minions out there, it took me 20 years to get all of the middlemen far to fuck away from me.


So in the record business, like y'all really don't know my temperature on things like it's a lot of miscommunication. Nobody knows how I feel. Actually, me and Ice was just talking about this outside before the pot. Nobody really knows how I feel about anything unless you come have a conversation to me. No. Or with me. Nobody that is, there is no publicist to speak, to street team to speak, to record label executive, to speak to distributors, to speak to all of those middlemen that fucking leech and leach and leach off of y'all. I worked my entire career to get those straps up off of me. Y'all not gonna mis manipulate that? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.


Y'all can DM me and Cardi said this to him. I am gonna DM Cardi my number 'cause she should have that line on me when she needs me. But the rest of y'all be very clear. I gain absolutely nothing from talking about any of y'all niggas. I'm not looking for friendship from none of y'all out there. I move the way I move. If niggas got a problem with it and the great words of no pun, Cardi, if it's up then it's stuck. When Drake drop a disc, I make a million dollars. None of y'all have that equity. Oh, you gotta take a lot. What the fuck? No, it's too many people out there that think that I have something to gain from speaking highly or lowly about you niggas.


That little box is reserved for him. I'm gonna come in here and talk about that nigga distract. Whether I like it or not. It's happened too many times. That's gonna be a good month. I'm sorry, flip. Flip. Got a headache. Flip is her. Yeah. Yeah. Flip is her. I can't believe. Wait, let that flip behind me. No, listen. The rest of y'all, the rest of y'all are not that. I don't want that to get confused. Honestly. I ain't looking for friendships with none of you niggas. I want to run my business, mind my business and keep to myself with my people.


That's what I wanna do. Oh, and on top of that, back to us being drivers of inventory. You better learn your value before somebody else learns it for you. Ooh, be clear. That's very good point. The building that I come from is the build. It had to be in your blood. You had to get a, it had to be in your blood to get a deal. It was fucking Ghostface, ll method man and all the older niggas at that fucking building. But outside of that, it was the greatest building with the greatest executives in the world. We talking about Julie, we talking about Kaiser, we talking about Pecos, we talking about Shaki, we talking about Leo, we talking about Kev. We talk rest in peace care. We talking about Tina Davis. The list goes on and on and on and on.


So you young fuckety fucks out there that have no idea that I ever even rap. Some of y'all are my great grandchildren. And grandchildren just by fucking design. She talking about somebody ain't got a mole in they fucking camp. I come from Def Jam Universal and everybody under Universal unfortunately for the artists and the pawns, the seats in the music business don't change very often. It's only y'all that change the spots. Everybody that I work with, they still got a great job still working this shit.


The young people still rely on them to get it moving. Most of y'all out there have somebody in your camp slash crew that helped Joe Button become what he was. I gotta like some of you niggas, even if I don't like you, niggas feels good to be at Angie Barbecue. See Sam Crespo. Sam Crespo worked focused nigga. Sam Crespo worked. Get right with me. Sam Crespo worked. Breathe. These are records. None of y'all know he has been working records for over 25 years. Hey man, When, you gonna stop man? Come on, come on Sam. In my talks, y'all gonna stop making it sound like Joe button failed and put a mic down.


No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. And don't make me pick it up and don't make me pick it up if I want to. If I happen to button happen to need an extra revenue stream one month, you fucking fuck itty fucks What? Nothing. Get your shit off James. You just, you swo, you sworn up and down. You are retired and you would never, I am retired but I want it to be clear like I left music. 'cause I see this gonna keep coming up when Joe Biden have a beef with people. I left music because I did not see an upside in the Ponzi scheme anymore. That's to be congratulated and saluted and respected.


Not manipulated and tricked to be something that it was not. I left because I did not see a way for mid-tier acts. Not the new definition of mid the record label definition of mid-level acts. I did not see a way for mid-level acts to make eight and nine figures in the music industry. So, I, left Pivot And. it worked. I don't hear enough about how it worked out there. I don't, all I hear is pump it up. All I hear is one hit wonder. All I hear is fucking he quit.


He put the mic down. He was a bum. We gotta start a, A joke ain't a joke. If we never get serious, that's why wore his shirt at some point we just have to get serious peace and love to Cardi offsetting her family. This rent is not directed toward them because they are on my list of people that I'm going to love no matter what. But the rest of y'all out there watch y'all fucking mouths when it come to me. Most of y'all are my sons. And don't make me have to do this again. That's it. Well now you have to deal with the internal issue that you about to have.


you know, sometimes when we go on rants Joe, we send, we tend to say things that we necessarily didn't mean to say. I heard what you're making a month and you kind of went light. And I may have a issue with that. So I need to have a lunch, dinner and breakfast with you this weekend. But I do support you. Everything you said was great. Salute trying To have a sleepover. Yes.

I don't give a fuck if any of these niggas is mad. Y'all should have watched this long enough to know I don't give a fuck if none of y'all is mad. If it's up, leave it there. That's where I'm at with it. I do not wanna be friends with none of you niggas. I ain't looking for an interview. I ain't trying to pander to you niggas. I don't want to. Kiki When I.

I got my Kirk Banks feature. Gotta wait till nigga All Come on Y'all talking y'all. Oj. OJ What Happened. He had sued Nike for Feds up Royal Royalties and back pay. 'cause he said he wasn't getting what he was supposed to get with his deal with them. My Bad got his Shit and he won 20 million Feds up. That gave him 20 million.


That's Suit was for, I'm not sure the particular come out, but that's what the suit was for. Might not be 20. Nike put out a statement to say that they won and they didn't have to give him shit. Really? So there, there were multiple suits. He sued them for I guess non-compliance and they sued him for non-compliance. And I think fact check it yourself, you lazy bums. But I think they both won. So it's the draw. Odell came out and said that he had to get 20 million but Nike's report soon after said they don't have to pay him anything. So I don't know. Check it yourself is what I'm saying. Got you. I didn't see nothing about the Nike side. But yeah, They put out a statement like very fast shortly after odell.


Yeah. don don't took that picture with all his lawyers. Y'all don't get no, don't get no smart ideas. That 20 ain't coming. Don't get no, no, no, no. For the other motherfuckers don't get no smart ideas or you other athletes. Well in, in sports, y'all ESPN put out their top 50 athletes since 2000. Okay. This is a bro, What we gonna do Top 10? We're not Do it. All three. All right. We do top 10. Kobe Bryant, 10 Hussain, bolt nine, tiger Woods eight. Simone Biles seven, Roger Federer six. Tom Brady five. LeBron James Four Lion Messi, three. Serena Williams two Michael Phelps is one. Michael The swimmer.


Yes. The Olympic swimmer. Michael Phelps is the number one athlete since two. Oh. They just Pan into the Olympic season. This is the dumbest list I ever, I, I I was just like, this is nuts. I can't, What was the criteria? Let's pick some names. No, shut up. I'm just, I always, that's what I would Pick. Somebody's backing for a Change's. That's, that's what I always, I think the, the list sounds ridiculous. Like the top 10 sounds ridiculous, but that's why I always wonder like what was the criteria? I don't know the criteria. I just know this list is nuts, bro. Michael Phelps is the number one athlete on this list.


I mean, I guess he would Lie. Yeah, he has an argument for it. Yeah. But argue with Dwights. He got an argument for it. He should argue with Dwights. I ain't telling 'em not to argue. Just don't argue with black folks. I don't think there's many black people that have Michael Phelps as the number one athlete since the two year, 2000. I don't think that many people have. Alright. It says one period voters were instructed to consider only an athlete's performance since 2000. So has, for example, Barry Bonds, he won seven MVPs but only four of those came after 2000. So did 317 of his 762 home runs. So they're just only counting 2000 up achievements.


Yeah, Just achievements from 2000 up. Nigga. We only ever heard of Michael Phelps during the Olympics. We didn't know what he was doing in between them years. Smoking Weed. Yeah. Oh yeah. He was doing what he wanted. Do fucking fucking chicks. That sounds like a wind to me. That sounds A little bit We up a little bit. That's the case. Then. we gotta bump up a lot of black people that smoke weed and fuck girls. Nigga. That nigga got the most medals in US Olympic history. For real? Yeah. And I don. So 23 Golds. Okay. Okay. That's pretty expensive. Who you talking about? That's a lot. That's dope. And the Olympics is only up four years. Every four nigga won eight and won Olympics. Who was his rival?


Dude, everybody. Everybody from every Other Country. And that's why I'm not putting Michael Phelps number one. We don't know the name of nobody else. A time he went that bull we just won. Nah, the nigga with the other us nigga with the funny hair. They used to be bitching but swimmer. Yeah. Oh, I mean that helps. That's a good point. I'm, I'm just saying the guy with the hair that you can't, I mean it's just not to be discounted is what I'm saying. Listen, for every Pete Samra there was a fucking Federer Agasy. Aga Aga Agasy agasy for every Jordan. There was a like if you Great then tell me who you had to Go's counterpart go up against. That was great. I'm not shitting on Michael Phelps. No, no, no. I understand. I'm not that's but I feel like we should know the name of somebody.


Who else who could swim. Good. I'm not, I'm not at mad at Serena being in top five either. I'm not. I'm not mad at that. I'm not mad of Simone bows. Simone bows extraordinary. Yeah, I think she should be a little bit higher. She, yeah, she they got a risk. Seven changed. She changed. She's crazy. Crazy. She's her who she beat. Who did she beat? Everybody. All of 'em. White hoes. See my point? All of 'em White hoes. Yeah, but When I go to her. Good point. But When I go to her. They change rules. They had to change rules because They disa little shit. Some shit that could do. She was great at for the women and they took it away from the men. You gotta fact check it yourself. But they changed like Rules They did for her.


Certain, Certain tricks that she could pull on. If They did that for Michael Phelps, then I rec can't and they Named certain, but then I don't get why Tom Brady's low at five Five's not low, But in this list, five Low LeBron, LeBron, LeBron higher and Tom Brady Shouldn't be Since 2000. No Shouldn't be. He Should be. Yes He should be. Why? Just counting accomplishments. Why? 'cause football is a different sport than basketball. Not saying that he's not the leader, but I think on the defensive side of the ball, it plays so much of a part in the outcome of a game. So much harder to win a Super Bowl than it is A NBA championship. And then to win seven of them Says the history of repeat winners Says how many others have won seven. I Disagree With that. I disagree with that too. Tell me more.


It's a lot of people that have had great NBA careers that are Hall of Fame. You gotta win four games to win a Super Bowl. Yeah, but I'm just saying if you look at the history of the Super Bowl winners, it's rare that you see dynasties and wins in a row as opposed to basketball where It's that speaks to regular, that speaks to parody. But you gotta win 16 games to win NBA champ. J listen I ain't athlete of the month nowhere so No, I'm just saying But who, who said that? I don't. What's more difficult? What You mean? Like what dynasties do we see in in football compared to the dynasties that we've seen in basketball? There's always been a dynasty in basketball since I've been a sport of The game. Steel has had a dynasty In the seventies. don don't know what dynasty means. 'cause I would have the bills as a dynasty just for going all the times.


No the dynasty. But you have to win. You gotta win. Yeah. You have to win. You have win a certain amount of time too. The Steelers did four in the seventies. That's like Dynasty. Yeah It's like I feel like it's the cowboy within In the nineties, the cowboy boys 10 year Period or something. Patriot the Patriots. Patriots since 2000 has been the Patriots. But that's probably, that's now maybe You can start to enter Kansas City into that conversation. Now Kansas City is a dynasty for sure, But it's been New England in the making since 2000. It's clear. Been New England. All right And. it is. It is been the bronies. Okay, well we're talking about Ain't know why I don't like that because in football if you have a great, great great quarterback, your chances are are pretty good. And the NBAI can't ever remember a time where one superstar made meant you was about to do something.


This is since the 79 Sixers Michael Jeffrey With Moses Malone and no Michael, Jeff never did it alone When he was there it meant you was doing something. But I'm a chance, I'm just, I'm just giving, he Was a first round exit until they drafted Pippen. So even then you made two. I mean they built a team. But I'm just saying I just think that because defensive means so much in football that it would be harder. you know what I'm saying? I see what you're saying. That that's all I'm saying. To Close this out, Shannon Sharp and Devonte Adams were having a conversation about who they think is just a better athlete. They both picked the football player because of how you have to maneuver on grass versus hardwood on football players vertical being just a vertical and you're not getting a running start.


The information that you have to retain process to play the game. I would agree. And and speed and any other like athlete test you wanna do. They have football players winning them both. And you gotta do all that while getting your ass whoop. No. And you gotta do all his contact. You gotta do all that shit on the, on the fly. Like the quarterback comes up to the line of scrimmage. He auto izing you as the defense. You gotta re, that shit is hard dog. That shit ain't No, they gave basketball players the agility aspect and football players, everything else. I I agree with that. I agree. I would agree with that. I would agree. I would like to think more about it before I agree. That's why I Even though I don't really watch the sports so much. That's why When, you ever see like a soccer match bro. Them niggas don't start running. They don't start running at all.


Figure as field And. it ain't no don't Yo. Y'all the defense. Y'all come off the field now the offense come on like it's just back and forth like this. Yeah I'm ass field. I'm surprised Mess wasn't higher. We Was number three. Was he? He He Right there. We walked through them. Soccer niggas in Lincoln Park. When, I was growing up nigga In Queens. Nah, Jersey City Walked on in England. First Walk. Right. Walk right through the game. Yeah. Go ahead over there. Go over There. Look at a little differently. Walk through Ghana way.

Camden is Philly so it's, it's still, it's right there for them. But yeah I down there and tell 'em that. I said Camden I joke with, I love Camden. Camden been going through a lot of changes though.

Oh man, I can't believe they fucked that Alan Ball. Alec Baldwin case up. But it's fine. I actually can't believe it. Presume innocent. Ah, let's do it. Presume Innocent Ice has to leave because he's now all the way caught up and we are about to talk about it. Yes, loser. Come on And make predictions because there's one episode left and in the next episode is when it, whoever killed Carolyn Palus is revealed. I've Not watched one episode. I gotta, I gotta tell y'all and I tweeted this Erickson because they both left the couch.


Don't show the couch no more. And. it looked And it look real dirty whenever they get up. Dirty ass Newark niggas. You ever buy something nice for dirty Newark niggas and see how they treat it. Fuck Your couch. Look at that. Fuck your couch. Eric's actually show the couch Eric. So go ahead. Look at this couch. Dirty ass niggas talking about real estate. I tweeted this but I think presumed Innocent has bodied every one of their cliffhangers at the end of the episode. You had Me shook. I thought they dropped two episodes and I only caught the one When you first tweeted and then I was like, okay, now I'm good. Eight episodes out. I think it's a nine episode order next season.


I think it's eight. Oh eighth and it's seven out. Yeah, whatever it is One. There's one more left. There's one left. The season finale is coming. I read the little paragraph. All it said was, all we find out, all will be revealed about the death and what really happened. It's like, oh fuck. And you know they need to bring back at the end of the episode, nigga show me the preview from the next I. Don the next one. I hate that. No, I love that you ate the Preview. I Hate the, I love that. I don't need the preview. Really? I don't care. I want the the Preview. Oh you crazy. I want the preview. I need the preview. They've done a, it's a masterclass. Not only in the cliffhangers but just you. Literally every episode you're like damn it probably was the prosecutor. Damn it probably was the kid. Oh no it was probably her kid.


Oh no, it was probably the wife. Yeah, actually it's probably him the Whole time. I've guessed somebody different every time. Mad times. And now that I've seen the ending of the last episode, SPOILER ALERT, I am inclined to think that the ending of this show is the same as the ending of the movie. If you don't know the ending of the movie, I won't tell it to you. I haven't seen the movie in A million fucking years. So I don't even remember. All right. So You can believe it if I say it. It is Tommy's wife. It's the prosecutor's wife. Huh. Now if I watch the end of that episode, it makes sense that episode ends and leads you to believe that it's either Tommy or somebody that they haven't introduced us to yet and somebody that has access to Tommy.


I don't think it is either of the kids. don don't think it's any kid that they've showed Shorty's kid. Jake don't have a kid. He does. Yeah. It wasn't the kid. Oh yeah. 'cause his kid was riding bike. don don't think it was any of the kids. I'm back to fucking defending Jacob. don don't think it was any of the kids. I don't think that it was dude's wife. Jake. What's his name? Rusty. Rusty? Yeah. don Don't think it's Rusty's wife. Okay. I don't think it was Rusty. Okay. And I'm not ready to commit to, they keep showing us Tommy's infatuation with with, but I'm not ready to commit to Tommy is prosecuting a case for the person that he killed.


I. think that takes some dedication. I'm not ready to go there. And that note that was left Go fuck yourself. Yes. For me it sounds like a woman wrote it. Yeah. Okay. Maybe I could roll that. It sounds like it. If I'm being sexist and I am or just a Sounds like Mel. Go fuck. Go fuck Yourself buddy. And anyone always says that That fucking shit. Yes. Bullshit. Everybody always says that's my white side. So Bullshit. Yeah. So I think it could be the wife. I don't think Tommy did it. Okay. Wait, so you don't think it's Rusty's wife? So whose wife do you think Tommy? Tommy's not married. I don. Somebody related to Tommy. Tommy's single with a fucking cat. It's A cat. don don't know that.


Yeah. No, he's single. He's, that's the whole thing. Like the build because He wanted the short, he wanted the Change. Yeah. The buildup has been his, his relat or lack thereof with Carolyn and how off put she was for with him that she went to HR and filed a complaint. That doesn't say that he don't have somebody in his life. Well this person the same way that Rusty has somebody in his life. Well No, but we've seen who is in Rusty's life. We see his wife, we see his children. We see them. So where does Tommy materialize? A wife. He's had a cat. That's it. So he doesn't have a wife. you know who I think it might be who? I mean I've gone back and forth, thought it was Tommy.


They made a really good case for it being her Carolyn's kid on the stand. 'cause he is full of fucking rage. He's weird. Yeah, he's He's a weirdo Weird, weird kid. I don't think it was him though. Because you don't tie your mom up like rotisserie. Yeah, Yeah. Like I'm not mad at the death, but to tie somebody up like that, it's gonna take something else. To me it's somebody who has intimate knowledge of that previous case. The Bunny Davis case. I think it's that. It's that. I think it was the second sperm. No, I, the second sperm guy For me. No, I think it's the other girl in the office. The one that had to take the stand. I can't remember what her name is right now. But why Would she do that? She clear, because they got her admit on this because she made like trusty. No, she, they got her to admit on the stand that she did not like Carolyn Palus at all. And she thought really poorly of her.


And she's just kind of like this character that's kind of like, you know, kind of periphery, hovering because she's on the, she's hovering on hovering around the periphery Hover. And I didn't like that conversation that she had with Rusty in the car. Yeah, That looked nuts. I didn. But see that's another way that it could be her because now she's like, Was it You in second thought? I never thought it Could have been you. I think it was you. I think it was you. She, you went to her house. She should Be a real psycho chick. You went to her house, she told you she was pregnant, she was gonna keep the baby. It was gonna destroy your family. Meanwhile we're talking about a woman who's dead who basically disowned her own child. So this does not sound like a woman that wants to keep progeny. She does not give a shit. And she was trying to break up with Rusty. So I'm just like, oh you're feet, you're creating a narrative.


So that's what led me to think that it's her. I like That Tommy did a real good job. Eviscerating. Oh he Bodied it? Yeah, he did a good job. He Bo Rusty on the stand. Oh he really did. Yeah. Rusty's an arrogant fuck. He Is. He deserves But so is Tommy. They both are. Yeah. No they are. But like the way that he opened the door by way of test testifying through Rigo the black cop and basically trying to assert his innocence by asking her questions. And that's what opened up the door to putting him on the stand. Right. He did that shit on purpose because he's so arrogant that he thinks that, you know, he can control every aspect of this for sure. And no, that shit blew the fuck up in his face with Tommy's.


He was doing good until that the the end. He was holding it down for A minute. Yeah, he unraveled rather quickly at the end. Yeah, he did. He Did. Yeah he did. He walked right into that trap. So he Snapped. Shit. You know how I feel for the most during this show. His Rusty's wife. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. Is Rusty's wife. Well which may lend to it being her. She is going in the back smoking cigarettes a lot. I don't think she's tough enough to tie her up like rotisserie. The rotisserie part is what's making it talk me. That's why I think it's the the, the second sperm. Remember in the old cases they found a second sperm sample that the, the coroner never reported. Yeah, That's the guy that Rusty beat up up when he came to his house. Theoretically. Yeah. I think it's the second sperm. We are looking at what the wife is going through on presumed innocent.


I have a better understanding for why the wife in defending Jacob left Jacob about to drive when the trial was going on and she was about to hear a bunch of bad things. Yeah. Yeah. I mean she has to listen to testimony of this man Wife got a bad, her Testimony of this man. No, not only saying that but in the text messages basically saying I want to leave my family for you and she has to sit there and listen to this shit. I do, I do like how she brought it up to him like when they got back to the house. Aint that What the niggas be lying though? See? Huh? Don't all the niggas be lying and saying that. Yeah, but he meant it like he really wanted to be what this dude really like. He wasn't just talking to get some pussy.


He was, he was losing his mind over this. He was. But when he went back to the house and the wife was like, So, I wanna be with you forever. I wanna be forever. So forever. Huh. Wow. Jaw dropper. So is that a lie or How did you even tell your wife? Oh nevermind. I Was just hordy man. I was hordy. That's what you're supposed to say. Yeah, I'm shutting up because I have been through. Okay. So where you're telling your, trying to tell your partner that what she read that you typed don't mean that it's a tough, it's a up, it's a uphill battle. It's a tough style sound. It's It is. It is. Which is why you should re text that you author and not that your partner's author but don don't wanna get triggered.


Yeah. Well Series has been great though. The series has been fantastic. Yeah. Yeah. Really happy that they got renewed. Really happy about that. What else? What else? What else Is there? Mayor? Kingstown has been bugging. We haven't been talking about it at all. Yeah, no. Hasnt it's been really good. Yeah. I feel like every week I come in here and talk about how great it's been. But maybe I'm off. Yeah. We, we Haven't, you guys haven't really gone into detail, haven't talked about how great the season's been. It's a little bit less cerebral of a show. Yes. I think. Thank you. Where it's less mysterious and shit like that. It's More shoot 'em up and Blow shit up. I wouldn't, wouldn't know about shoot 'em up. But It's lot of, lot of, lot of violence. There's Not a whodunit aspect to it so it's a little bit harder to fucking break down I feel like. But the show it's been, see I think it's starting to get cerebral.


Tell me more. Mayor of Kingstown. Like they like Yo. I want you to hit Bunny Washington. I didn't know what they meant. He meant like kid him and knock off his drug supply. So when Bunny finds out that that happened, now also on the cerebral side, nobody knows who threw them. Those girls in the water. Yeah, true. Nobody knows who threw those girls in the water. No we Spoiling that shit. It's fine. I don't care. I don't care. Fuck them niggas. I don't care. Spoil that shit. So. I. I think now it's gonna be more mental game because we've never seen Mike and Bunny at odds. True. Ever. True. And we don't know if the Russians are s at odds. They not so far. We don't know. But They That's True.


They painting a, they painting a picture like It's about this jump off between the Russians and the Aryans. And so that again, that just leaves the door open to who threw the girls in the water.

I'm harsh and cruel. I'm LA off the tool at the toddler school. I'm a new man. Time to start leading in the blind. But trying to change the world is a harsh reason to rhyme.
