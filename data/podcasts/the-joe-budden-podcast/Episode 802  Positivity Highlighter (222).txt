He got skin in the game. No, no, no, no, no, no. You Joseph, slow down. Stop, slow down. I I stand on the other side of that. You don't have as much skin in the game as the baby daddy that been there for a year.


No you don't. I Disagree. I totally Disagree. I don't, I totally disagree because of the child. I Know. Yes. So everybody relationships with they significant. I don't want to hear none of that 10 years. Shit. You Talking about niggas don't care about the Kids. I get there for a Year. Niggas don't care about kids bro. Stop. A lot of times a nigga would just go cold Tech. Alright. I'm not bas my argument still you be some dead nigga. That is just, but that's, but that's, listen, I'm not bas that's not what I'm basing my argument on. Okay. He basing Your argument over A nigga came for a year and was there and shot it up and wants to be there. Okay. I'm not talking about Got it. Okay. That's nasty. But they, They ex still so he don't want to be there. They broke up already. No, you were Shorty Now an active Father Wants. Yeah, but you was Shorty Now that wants to actively co-parent.


Oh, I'm not talking about you being with her. I thought y'all said I was with her for 10 years And now you with her. I I'm the ex but I was with her for 10 years. Yeah. No, the the baby daddy's the ex too. He ain't there either. Yeah, but he was there for a year and had a baby. Right. No, that person has more skin in the game than whatever relationship equity you think you've built over those 10 years. You are crazy as An ex. I'm just telling you what I think. I'm not argue with y'all and y dog. Let me tell you something. The shit we did in 10 years, we done been to the Swiss Alps. We done did this. We done did that. I put you on that restaurant. I put you on that position. I told you how to lick up the shaft. All of that shit dog. That that 10 year shit carries. I I taught you the tricks. Bitch. Yo. All of that 10 years, shit.


You carry some way more. Wait up the shaft, nigga. I told you what I like Bitch, lick up this motherfucker. Take your time Doing the slow motion. Yeah, exactly. Do it slow. Don't, don't be sucking my dick like you in no race bitch. Slow down or motherfucking monkey. Yes. I don't need that much shaft for personally. Your shafts might not be that long, bro. I don know. I'm so bad. I'm, I'm letting them cook. I just don't see how that's in response to what I'm saying. Listen To this, the relationship you taught Her. All of those things. Cool. So that 10 bravo Because Of me, she's the woman she gets to you go that 10 years. Thank you. Weighs on her. Thank You. So she will take that with her and apply it to her future. I wish I, when you talk to her, you talking about you and her ward stories have a blast.


All the restaurant we went to when we talk, we not just talking about me and her. Okay. Talking about the child. We talking about a third party. Yes. Again, in my argument, both parents want to be active. Got it. Parents got It, got co-parents. That holds way more weight than whatever you taught her in college. Whatever sex y'all had on a beach, I think y'all are both right. I think we're building, we Building a person, Joe, and that and guess what the conversation Are? Building a person. We ain't talking about adults and the impact you had on an adult life. We building a person from scratch now. Cool. Okay. And that's A lot more weighted than, but also we fucked on the beach that one time by mint condition was sick. But You being guess where the conversation stopped. But he, but he, yo what size he need?


Yo, I need to send you this money, blah, blah blah blah blah. That's the extent of the conversation. When you got two active co-parent. That's not true. Let me finish. Please. That's, That's a Very, they're talking about the child. That Is a very pessimistic view on what a co-parenting conversation with sounds like. Him being and Weird end him being, him being a fat, Which I understand 'cause maybe that's all we come from up here. But that's, I understand what You're saying. I don't think that that is the extent of the conversation. What I'm saying is this, with the two parents, the two active co-parents, their, I'm sorry. Their primary concern is the child. Yes. Right fact. Their primary concern is the child. What that 10 year relationship, when that nigga gets on the phone with that girl, they don't have a specific, specific objective in mind.


That is reminisce. Mary j Blige is coming on in shorty's head and that nigga's head great. I love that song. He throw it on. He know he knows more about the girl than the than than the guy. 10 times there for the One year. 10 times about each other. He knows more. They can relate on things. He understand The ups and downs. Hell, the guy is there for one year. You don't know that much about the woman. I just don't see how that holds more weight than raising somebody from scratch Because you're raising somebody from scratch. I don't See that part. Y'all both trying something new. New. I think they're close people if It is a newborn, Not me. Yeah. I don't I think they're people If They Both, I recognize what they saying. I think they, It ain't, I think it's like this. I don't think so close. If It is their first child, I think they're starting from new, especially a year is too soon. You don't really know that Much. Relationship holds way more. I Agree with you. You don't know that much.


So YY y'all starting from scratch together. You don't know how she, If I have different emotional, I Don't want us to be circular. Okay. Got it. If I have The child and I call her and she's with 10 year dude, if I call that phone a hundred times in a row, she's answering the phone. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. 'cause you have the child. It's not vice versa. But it's not about you. It's not vice versa. It's not about the dude, it's about the child. This is my point. So the connection would be deeper. No. The connection. Me and my Kids. Well being the connection would call for, for you to think outside of yourself when you want. Insert self, bring back 10 year due. Awesome. Have a blast. Yeah. I don I don't feel like a want.


We're being Circulated. Yeah. I respect it. I we're pretty close. I respect it. I do put something on y'all's Because 10 years you damn you're family basically. You like Yes, I know. I know. When you get in the corner and your face go stiff, something's wrong with you. I know. Way more. I Know this one year nigga don't know nothing about your moods. Yeah. How common y'all think that is What y'all saying Common 10 Years, Joe. Very common. You could damn near finish a niggas sentences that you been with for 10 years. Well Y'all only on one, one side of the coin. The nick, there's people that 10 years or more and they just your biggest op now or you know 'em so well that you don't get along. Mm, that's possible. Of course that still don't mean that the emotional ties. And I still know everything.

I came across an interview that said where Clark, Kent was like, yo, I wasn't gonna the doctor on some Brooklyn shit, but if I could change something I would've went so that I could have seen whatever was there and kind of known how to move.


I went and took the two scans and the full body MRI that Michael Paul's been on me about. I finally went up there. I canceled that shit eight week months. I went up there and did it. Mm good. I mean yeah It is. So, but that is a different experience as an adult I heard than it was at 21, 23, 27 when you had your whole life in front of you. Like when you could depend on your body to be its own hospital and just kind of look good at 28. Don't they gotta put that thing in your system. Getting in that shit at 44.


It was a little different. How long you was in it nigga? Like 80 minutes. Mm. It's a long time to be 80 minutes. It wasn't an open MRI was it. Oh you had to go in the little shit the the tube. I had to go in the tube thing they gotta put, did they give you the shot? And it was a bigger tube but I still had to go in the tube thing. Do all this breathing shit can't move. Well first of all, as soon as I sit down to do whatever they doing, my heart rate, the anxiety keeps, my heart rate is going 'cause I'm nervous. I don't even wanna be here. So he like, oh your heart can't put you through. He said all right, let's see if it slowed down.


Gave me a little something. Shit was still kind of going you claustrophobic. I was like so already we've identified an issue. He said look, it's slow it down, down. Slow it down. Send me a little MRI thing. She said All right we got some headphones for you. What you wanna listen to? I said Chris Brown. You know what I mean? Something that the songs could just go, man I got in that thing with them headphones on one Chris Brown song played. The next 30 minutes was ads. Oh did the free Spotify tier for you. You with the free next 30 minutes free YouTube music. I'm might hear four Chris Brown songs and the rest minutes ads. And then she talking Yeah you gonna go to sleep.


I went near could not fall asleep. That thing was the loudest in MR MRI machine I've ever heard. It Is loud. It was the loudest mri. I forgot. I ain't been to an MRI thing in 20 years. It's loud as hell. Then she gimme me. The little thing of ma jiggy the little squeeze ball, stress ball. Hey if you want to get outta this thing, just squeeze the ball. As soon as she put me through, squeeze it. Bam. Get outta this shit. My nose is itching. Let me scratch. Soon as you get in that thing a thing itching. Now I gotta pee again. Now I gotta fart. I'm holding my shit. My nose is itching, my mouth is itching. I got crust in my eyes. I got my thumbs. I'm laying on my thumbs. So they went to sleep in about 20 minutes.


'cause you gotta keep your hands to your side. And then the, the ball broke. Oh you, you squeezed the shit out that ball. Then the ball broke. So I didn't realize that till I was already gloss four and ready to get outta there.

What y'all wanna talk about? We got no music. We did got a little secret. Jake Hoso. Yeah, He dropped it on his blog. It's something that he said he just wanted to throw out there something he worked on called cLOUDs. I sent it to everybody in case y'all didn't have the the blog. I do have the blog but I didn't get it from there. I got it from you. The record is dope man. The record is dope. My niggas be something Loud. Head to the cLOUDs. Alright, Crowd world is changing right front Brand new code.


What is this record called? cLOUDs. cLOUDs. cLOUDs. You said you like the barks. I like it. I like it. You like it a lot. Hey please believe These flows teach egos the freeze and them reede them C four beneath your jeep. The second you turn that key hold and heat blows your weak flows right out the water. The father boy I work smarter and harder. My style. I got a restraining order. Don't bother. I charter unseen territories and order to push your father than you niggas had ever thought of. I caught a lot of murder charges turned artists to Marty. When I rocked out, turns to goddess things turn to kings dreams, turn to things tangible.


My hands are forward with grants I pulled from Stan says, no I can't go slow. I'm Sandra Barley. The proceed to speed of don't breathe snow creed a color that won't heed to the one and the planet will shake when not performing. Tectonic plates from a I'm gonna pause this 'cause I don't wanna let the old four minutes play and I thought he really went crazy on that. Next verse. Second verse was Second. Yeah. The next verse absolutely bonkers. Got that little Andre flow bag. Yeah. Yeah. He, he left Earth on the second verse. Yeah, he did. I like it. I thought it was cool. Yeah, I like it Too. I like it a lot. I like it a lot. I don't like, I'm still tired of like the secret blog drop or Instagram drop or whatever I want to own. Maybe that's just like the record collector in me. I want to own the shit.


Like for real, not like a dub. Right. I got, which is what I equate the MP three, Two. I like the blog era coming back. I like it. I like blog era coming back. I wish blog era would come back in terms of people aggregating a bunch of dope music. But like just artists releasing some shit where you gotta dig for it and find it. I don't love. Well I I I actually like it sometimes. Two Dope Boys had an exclusive that you could only get on two Dope Boys. Same with Da Piff, same with you heard dad new. There's another one, there's another big one. Forgetting Not Right, not right. Yeah. And duh not right. Yeah. There was, sometimes it was joints you could only get from there is all I'm saying. So that, that feeling of blog era, I like that. Even when the SoundCloud wave took off and you can only get things there.


I I kind of like that mix tape exclusivity thing still sometimes, depending on who's doing it. I like it just because it feels like when, when an artist does it this way, they're taking the pressure off of now. I don't, it don't, I don't care how it performs. Right. I'm not selling, I I'm giving it directly to those who subscribe to me. You know what I mean? I don't have, this is just for my people. It's just, hey, hey here. I get that It is something for y'all. I just, it it, it's another way. And there's certain artists that are very big on direct interactions with their fans. Kobe being one of 'em for sure. So I appreciate it from him. I, I like when each other, I Guess let me, let me let clarify or go deeper. I, I'm conflicted because the fan of me, the fan, the j Cole fan of me or if any of my favorite artists release shit that way.


I'm just excited to get new music. But the collector in me, I want a thing. Whether it's a, a real high res MP three with a cover. I want that. I don't want just some MP three. Like it's like getting a Maxwell tape. Maxwell tape with the fucking for the song. That was fun. But I also want like the cover. I don want to jump in in this mix Please. This sounds like a, this sounds like a fun one. It's A little nerd. This is fun. Yeah, because I'm a music collector as well, so I understand what you're saying. Yeah. My only retort would be for the artist to ever get the power back in their hands. It is the the, It is gonna be the fans and the music collectors that have to suffer.


I don't, I don't agree with that at all. I think you can still release music on your blog in a way that is Likeable Link purchasable or whatever downloadable in a more tangible format than just MP three with this, with the blank apple fucking default logo. Shit. Well that Wasn't that go against the label or Some shit. Hold up purchasable from where where the website, a dead link send you to website to his own. Yeah. Website. Fuck it. I would encourage artists to do that. You could do that. Yeah. Fuck it. Why Can't you label An issue with with his with the Show. With the show. With the with the But with The podcast. The podcast. Yeah. Yeah. Similar. So what I'm saying is he's already shown and I think there are a lot of people that believe that the future of the music businesses will be D two C.


Yeah. Yes, absolutely. I agree. Image, Just music. Well that's what I'm saying. Like, and if you agree with that part then you kind of got a champion. Yeah, that's true. When this happens. I agree With that. Agreed. I just think it could be done better in that give me a album cover, give me a link. I want download, I want the hard red shit. I want, I don't want no fucking shitty MP three. I want some good sounding shit. Well the point was like, 'cause even with the, even with certain blogs, the blog era we talked about certain shit was just streamed up there through an embedded player. I know. Yeah. It wasn't meant for download. Okay. So yeah, that Was, He didn't have this, I Had to rip this, my response. So This, that just tells me this wasn't meant for that. Yeah because if he, if he wants something that you can download, I'm pretty sure he's gonna give you a cover And a lot of the nerds we put on covers so that ain't even nothing to, I already got a cover on this.


Yeah. Jane ain't crying off of that. So they could do that for sale and the label don't, I Don't have, no, I don't know what his contract situation. I, I imagine 'cause he has his old label that he Could, he may be able to do that. We're not talking about across the board. Gotcha. Okay. Whatever his situation is, clearly he has the power to do that. Gotcha. Yeah. I'm not saying this has to be on Spotify and Apple. I would just like to get like a good version with a cover and like have it like it's, it's like presenting, it shows value. You value the piece of art that you created when you present it in a beautiful way as opposed to just like I said, the the corny default fucking but this but this but This ain't that though. Like he even goes off the same like yo this is something I just worked on. This ain't the art I'm Giving y'all's. That's bullshit.


I don that. My response to that though is who's to say ain't He may, he may Download like we don't know. He might just be early with that. You might be right. So this could be the early, Hey you cannot download this. He might double back with full length vinyls. The new artwork. He might go do some arts and shit. It's Cole. So I would love to see Cole or anybody this magnitude be like, no you have to go to my website and buy this. That's, or you have to buy a record or, or you have to buy, buy a CD or tape or whatever the fuck format you want to give it to us in. That's fire. I would love to See that. That's what Kanye's been doing. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. For sure. In my opinion, the music that we've gotten from Kanye in this era has not been, this is a good j Cole song. The Kanye songs that we've gotten as he's been independent are not this in comparison to the rest of his catalog.


This is on par with anything j Cole has ever done in my opinion. The Kanye stuff that he's doing completely independent. It is not, in my opinion, It is not graduation or yeah. Anything else. Got it. Cole made out really good outta that whole big three shit he did. I know he got his back kicked in a bunch. Yeah. I may have even said this before, but with every release and I just hear his tone and how he goes about things. It's clear that not only did he not want to end up being the Drake in that battle, like the person who caught the worst end of the stick. I don't think he wanted to end up being the Kendrick in that battle either.


Yeah. I think I agree. The winner and having to run all around and having this be demanded of you and just, I don't, I think he landed in the perfect spot, bro. Peace. I I, yeah. My peace. He chose peace Annie. He told us that than his hip hop. So we didn't care. Yeah. My peace, my peace of mind is more than all I shit. He chose that. I don't want the anxiety that comes along with the interviews. Like I wanna do a Super Bowl. Yeah bro. Like yeah that's a lot at the Kendrick has a lot of pressure on him or has at least in the last six months. They're not Medical's happy with make some niggas just happy with being Content with where they are bro. Right. Life is good. I'm straight. Must be easy too when you as successful as goals but like I Don't need none of that shit. Yeah. Fuck all that.


Fuck that second verse. I want to hear some of this second verse and then we can get outta here For to claim the real but todo straight forward the pain I feel on my frame gets transmuted to a dangerous flame. I spitfire at the devil while the angel sang. The flow changed but jermaine's the same. I'm playing Jane The funny shit. I can see this going off of his show. Yeah, Sure. I hope for sure. I don like the rest. My mind's quite depressed if I don't write these. I'm Spike Lee and the audio back in my barrio parties got shout out. So I put up on my cardio dodge shells collect coins like a Mario. But this Is not a game And experience A serious level. That nigga crack your head. Trey. Yeah. Watch him after my son, nigga, nigga crack Trey head. Watch your mouth. You hear that nigga going.


My daughter is not here yet to crack your daughter in the booth, nigga. No she won't. Your daughter can't rap nigga. God, come on. What the fuck? Can't help. It Is changing. I like that record. Dope. I I love this shit. Dope. That Shit's beautiful. Yes. Yeah, let's get that. Yeah. I'm that bass in your trunk. The bullet, the Ms. Trump, the gunner jam 'cause it seen God had other plans. The son of man extending his hand, the son of Sam and forgiveness for all of the homicides we witnessed the overdramatize, the traumatize sickness thrown in the pen and caramelized for richness and served on a plate with sir loin state to billionaires who don't care if the world's going to break long as they make money. Y the pain brings profit. One man gains as soon as the next man lost it.


There's a bridge. You can walk to his, but there Real Gracious, the rich man crosses 'cause greed is a poisonous seed. Indeed It is. Spreads light weeds through the mines apple trees. I proceed with caution and I'm not flossing. Unlike some, I'm not defined by my fortune. I'm defined by rhymes though I'm in my prime. There was times that I was down 'cause I thought I lost it. But no. And behold, as my poetry grows, I give all glory to God. The story unfolds. The great heads to grow on my head. Show Nigga. Get this nigga gracious. Get this nigga out. Yeah man. Oh, shout cold. That shit's amazing. Yo, we As, as the people, We so like We, we so we're so fickle. Wait, hold up for a minute. Who lucky.


Go ahead. Yo. Put your who lucky. Put your ego back in your pocket. Yo, I just didn't know who he was talking to y'all. You lucky how well I am. My God is good. You lucky you retired. He saying, yeah, you lucky you not out right now. While that man is out right now rapping like that. He's saying, Mm, you don't even get none of these niggas without a Joe Biden. You know who the fuck you're talking to. You know who you're talking to. I mean, he did big you up several times during This. You know what you're talking to Podcast show. Fix your Fucking mouth if you sit next to a fucking legend every week, Melissa. Oh shit. I was what you saying my brother Don't touch me. I was saying in that I, I was happy that we, you know, we are able to clean it up and give him his credit because he did get his back kicked in.


He did. He still getting, he still getting, I mean he was making fun of him, but he's he's able to stay poised, stay to himself. True To himself too. Don't care about that shit no more. And then he was able to, the apology to just put out quality music. Like this is quality Time heals off, Time heals off. You So phony. You ny You I say it every week on this spot. I'm ny so phony. Listen, do you, do you want, should I give him a cure Joe or are we doing shit in the spirit of hip hop? The mc in me and in the spirit of hip hop, I didn't want to hear that shit. The man in me absolutely loves it. Got you. Absolutely loves it. Got it. And, and I think he's happy with the choice he made. Yeah. By Far too. Yeah. Nigga Girl came out and was getting that joke.


Oh yo Nigga Jake Home played for the fucking Shanghai Sharks. Who at the fuck? Jerry and Elizabeth, Elizabeth Lyons. Y'all know who Jake Cole is, man, now he bigger. That nigga was hitting the corner baseline. Three foot of Lisbon Lions Pick him up, my nigga. I always pick Jake Cole up. Of course. Yeah. Well I think I do. If, if I had to opt to have a problem with a rapper, it wouldn't be Jake Cole. Yeah, no. Nah, I threw you backed down From no one. That's not the name that you would want to pick outta the hat. I mean, I'll do it, but that's a headache. Yeah, it's a long, it's a long day. It ruins your day.


It ruins your day, not his. Oh Yeah. Yeah. That's so funny. Got you. I would love to see y'all be a rapper just for day like a trouble. I said that the other day. I would love to be rapper, like trouble making rapper just once. Just so I could just see. I, I wish I could rap Just so I could see how y'all would go about it. Ran Ransom gonna tell me yo, just rap. Nothing, nigga. No, that's the problem. Too many people are just rapping. Yeah. Word. Nah, I'm cool. V because I would wanna see y'all in the event that a superior mc just was going crazy at the, the mouth about one of y'all. Yeah. Yeah. Like what do you do? What do you think y'all would do? I, I would have to rap. Gotta rap. You gotta rap. Superior Mc or not nigga.

Oh man, how you doing? I know that nigga ain't treating You right. Come home. Like yeah, that niggas is nasty. So never Ever, ever, what other, what other music came out? Say, John Drop. Don't look at me with your shade.


Y'all back. Come on. Look, St John dropped. Yes he did. St. John dropped. I listened to It. St. John dropped. I checked it out. That's my man. I checked it out too. Big fan, big fan. I was a little disappointed. It felt like there was an intentional attempt at appealing to audiences that are outside of his shit. It was like a little more rappy, a little bit more trappy. Like I, my favorite thing about St. John historically has been like genre ambiguity. Like it could be rock, it could be r and b, it could be hip hop, like it's kind of all of them. It's just music. This one, there's like, so, you know, shout to take Keith and what's my other man that does a lot of future shit, pardon me for forgetting.


But it's a lot of like, it's more rap shit. Which I don't love from him. I like the ambiguity. I like the Eclectic one song. Is this Sting or is this Travis Scott? I don't know this one. There's like some weekend sound and shit. There's some Travis sound and shit. Not for me. See and for me, he's Still good music by the way. He, he's, He's always done that like this album. I could hear how he may be leaned into it more, but that sound to me is not a foreign sound. Like it's a Saint John sound still probably his biggest song. What was that? The big one, the Trap one? I think that Future did remix a few years ago.


That might have been his biggest song. I, I'll find it actually. So we could sound like we're researching. Hold up. I ain't hear the album, but I'm not familiar. Yeah, I ain't hear the album. Yes, you, yes you are. The park shit is Like, he's, he, it's still good music. I don't want to like, Here we go. I would argue that this is his biggest song Remix after remake John Hend Millionaire. So that sound, I think I know from him, right. And I'm not even doing this justice right now.


The littles. Yeah, I know, I know. That's horrible. Alright, there we go. I never heard that song before. There we go. There we go. Re there we go. Hold on. Let's give him a little bit of justice. Let's do little justice up in here. Millionaire. Hey This my shit. I Ain't record A lot of good times this Record. Nah, yeah, nah. When it come on in the spot, It is one of those shout to St.


John. Oh shit. And this is the second track off of St. John's new album Body On Me. I think the feel is gonna, Oops. I got you. There you go. I got you Ready?


Yeah. I think he's still on his black post Malone shit. I do. And I think that if you used to the St. John Sound, then he leaned into that a little bit and you might not be so mad at this project. There's Some shit on here. I like though. I like the intro. I like the intro side. Fuck being sad. There's a couple joints I like, I just like, It is more eclectic bag I guess. Lemme lemme put it that way. Got and It is not Bad music. Like let be clear, He's, I understand what you're saying. He's talented. But a five year absence, I expect like some, You know what I mean? Oh, you were digging in. I know what you're saying. 'cause like this is the St. John I like right here. This is off his last project.


This is high school reunion. It is one of, this is my shit right here. This nothing like this on there for. Hey, that's What I'm saying. Yeah. This is missing. This Is genre Ambiguous as fuck. This could easily be Don Henley or fucking, I don't know who else like inspired by. Yeah, I get what you're saying. Hey, hey.


The, Oh man, that's hard. That's hard. I I like that. I like that. That's hard. Yeah, that shit all right right there. Yeah. I don't think there's anything like that on the new project, but I'm not mad at it. I'm not mad at That's St. John. Yeah, that's, I'm A fan. That's old.

Is everybody here caught up on Paradise? I Haven't seen this. This episode of my wife Is Away. Yes. I'm caught up. Yeah, Nobody's Caught up. What you been doing if your wife been gone watching? I've Paradise. I've been watching Yellowstone. Okay. Which actually is a good show. Amazing show. Yeah. I'm only in season one, but it's amazing show. I'm I'm into it. I've never seen it.

So y'all are caught up in Paradise. Yes. Yes. I'm not gonna spoil nothing for Parks 'cause he didn't see it. So Thank you. This is technically not a spoiler alert, even though it might be whatever. My only question to y'all two. Do y'all believe her?


Who's her? Don't gimme the talking more Sinatra. It's the question of the episode. Do you believe Sinatra? Fuck no, I would've bust freeze. Yeah. I would've bust her head. Listen to this. I I I do. She might be right. This is my thing. Even if she Right. You was holding that from me as a Trump card. Oh, you talking about that part? Yes. That's what everybody's talking about. Yeah. Do I believe the the, the ending? No, she don't know. I I've said that she don't know for sure. She said I might be able to number one and number two, even if you could, I'm a bust her head to the white meat fan.


It wouldn't even have been no hesitation. That's my only question. Y'all. Without giving up, without giving up too much have, because the episode did just recently air. So I don't wanna be that guy. But when that happened, I'm like, knock it off. Knock it off. I don't believe this for one second. I Don't believe that. PP Not knock for one second. It's Mel Was say, Do y'all believe that Paradise is one of those shows that could be mirroring what? Yes. The future can look like a thousand percent for human beings. In which case would you want to go under the ground or would you want to see what happens If I go under the ground? They'll save a lot of money. They can cut that daylight off all of that fake sunlight cloud shit that they doing.


Turn it off. If we in the other spot, just let me know what the light switch is. Yo, shut up. Yo. Yeah, nigga. That's China has done it. China did the fake sunlight. They working on it right now. I don't know nigga. I'm getting my shiny news from You. No, I'm just saying they they doing it. You right. Always say some shit. All right. China's working on fake sunlight Literally right now. They got it. I don't even think they working on it no more. The funny thing is got, But that's not the i important part. The important part is world destruction. But What I'm saying is why would you be focused on creating fake sunlight if you don't think that we gonna be in a place where we gonna need it? How? You know, we ain't there now. We might be. That's the first thing I said when I watched that, when I watched the very first episode.


I'm like, we could be in this shit right now because like those, that's the first generation in that fake world. Shit. 3, 4, 5. Once the old heads die off and it's generation younger, a hundred years from now, they don't know. That's the the only world they know. Oh, You had an edible. We can I didn. But that's the Only world they know. I like that. I like, I like his theory. I don't think he's right though. I mean, I'm saying but who's to say, who's to say that's all? We don't know what the fuck is really up there. They ain't flying down There. And they didn't put them stars up there. They didn't put them stars up there in our fake world, if we believe everything they've told us about stars and how there's more stars than particles of sand.


And that's a lot of work for the fake, for the fake earth. Yeah man. I didn't say it's impossible, but that's a lot of work for the fake earth. The Big dipper Don't be moving man. What would be the point bar shielding us? From what? Barring us From what entity out there Beyond us. That's the question. That is the question. It is above our pay grade. So You think we're in Is Mars, is Mars in the universe or outside the universe? Oh, Don't get me started on Mars. I'm Asking Mars. Come on. Didn didn't know you had such insights on Mars. Man, I don don't get me started on, on Mars. No, look, I said this a long time ago. I don't fuck with you. And, and I tweaked it a little bit.


What I think now if You take it dead, I'm taking it. Oh, I'm taking it nowhere. You talking about Mars. Okay. Okay. I I I can't prove it. Of course. I just, I really believe this. I think that one humanity originally lived on, well not originally, but at some point way in the past we lived on Venus. Shit, let's go. Lemme finish. Let go. I need your edible. Let's do it. Finish. It got too high please. They realized that that planet was gonna be uninhabitable and we needed to move. So you hit Mars? No. So we hit Earth. Oh. We are the original aliens here to earth. Oh, Okay.


Humans from Venus originally to Earth. I kind Of believe that we're aliens. So at first I was thinking, I was saying it like, because again they say the center of the universe is gravity. Gravity pulls everything to the center. Even if it's a little bit at a time. I was saying like the planets are slowly moving closer to the sun, which was explained Why? Hence global warming. Global warming, all the religious books and predict that the end of the planet here will be by fire. Okay. I think that they know that. And the next step is get y'all asses to Mars. That's where Elon and all of them keep saying that. Yo, the next place is Mars. We have to get the Mars to colonize Mars. This is just history repeating itself.


So soon Mercury will be gone. Yes. Well I wouldn't say soon, but Not soon, but at some point. But yeah, it's either that or the sun is expanding, Which Will create the same problem. Oh my nigga. Freeze. He's been, when he was looking at that light bulb, when you stared at that light bulb, you picked up some shit. My guy freeze waiting on this moment right here. I said this Before. Nah, he go ahead. Get in your bed. What happened Venus? My nigga freeze woke up waiting for somebody to say something about bar. This Moment. This moment. I played life with the Oh my God. I've always Believed that though.


Okay. Seriously. It just, it explains so much. Okay. And the only way to communicate It is the why. Why do you think we come from Venus though? That's just the next planet. Because that was the second. We're working, working our way backwards. It is the second, Venus is the next one. They call it our sister planet. It says it has a similar build of Earth. It's just too hot for us to live there, for us to ever get there and explore there. So if it's too hot for us to live there wouldn't be too hot for us to live there initially. No. No. Because It is slowly was moving closer. Closer and closer and closer and closer. So how We get to the earth? Advanced technology, advanced civilization, same way we got rockets and shit that took us to the moon and the exploring Mars with all the shit that SpaceX is doing. We had that before.


Now you gotta start over. So what about the, what about the niggas that, that, that, that was using rocks to build shit. You think it a start over Humans. It is a massive reset. Got it. Okay. Okay. I'm not mad. I'm not mad at this theory. The only thing I'm, the only thing that I would say is you still Got Neil Neil number. Yeah. I'm gonna have to call Neil Degra. With the technological advances, we would've still had the same rockets and all that other shit necessarily. How you communic? Not necessarily. We have to, you just send, basically you could send seeds somewhere. And at the point where earth gets close enough to defrost to sprout them. Now here's now life can begin. So Adam and Eve with seeds basically.


Yes. And Marvel universe is corrupting your fucking Brain. That's literally What yo Hey listen, We have no way of proving none of this shit. Go read the Bible and tell me that all of that is I ain't gonna do it. Nevermind. Yeah, but Oh you agree with 'em? No, I'm just saying it sound good. All the shit. Yeah. Nah, we need the Bible of ice man. Rent your shit Man. The book, book of ice man. Yeah man It is Chapter three. They sent them down to rocket ship And Then, and then they just destroyed the rocket shit to start all over. Start over. Erase your memory nigga. Men in black shit. No you ain't send 'em in Rocketships. They sent seeds nigga. That's right.


Said embryo nigga. Just some nut Got Here and everybody got on the rockets. Nah, just the Seeds. Just the seeds nigga. It is some star Superman. And when it thawed out, the seeds sprouted. Right. Y'all give so much more power to human too. Human humans than I do. That's my problem with the theory. But we give so much, y'all give more power to humans than I do. Like I think humans on the grand scale are like the ants of the, The universe. I agree. I think we, so the things See that we were sophisticated enough at conception to be on another planet, see what was going on, travel to the next planet, populate this motherfucker, dur man during the pandemic, the humans was buying toilet tissue.


I just, I'd buy pink toilet paper with Perfume on it. I don't, I don think that humans are as bright as humans think they are. I think What we actually might be, we might be, we might be In the 2000 years humans between, just look at just the evolution of just 2000 years of humans. Niggas just got languages. Like all of this fly technological shit we got right now is only in the last what? 50, 60, 70 years. Evolution is moving outta exponential rate evolution. So what's the, what's the next 100 years gonna look like? I, but I disagree with that. I call cap. You can't tell me that in one breath. And then tell me that ages of years ago we had the technological advances to go from planet to planet. That contradicts itself. We may, I don't think that we are taught about the technology that existed back then and how the pyramids was made and did Giants really exist and how they was really moving around now.


I don't think we were taught that. I think we're From what we know, Half alien and half half. Yeah. From what? From what we know in modern world. Elliot came, yes, you're right. The techn technological advances came within since 80 or 70. Yeah. 69. Somewhere around. I get it, I get it. I get it. That's all. All I'm saying It is just we, my point is they gave You the option to go to Venus right now. Would you go Venus? Hell no. It's Too hot. Mars. Yep. You would go to Mars. I would go. If they gave each of you the option to get the fuck off Earth, y'all would go. Absolutely never just to see bro. We're gonna die anyway. So I would go just to see what It is. No, I'm cool. We gonna die anyway. Yeah. I'd rather die here. I don't wanna die and float.


I would go, I don't want to die in the, I don't want the, this energy to pull my body into the abyss. I want to just die in the Hospital. And guess what? The same shit that happens afterwards is gonna happen whether you're there, here or anywhere else. So yeah, I would wanna see something different like Move on. Says you. I don't know that I'm saying me. I don, I don't know. And that's not my belief system. I don't know that if you die somewhere differently, that different things don't happen to you in afterlife. I don't know that I need Neil Degrass to come argue with me. We don't know none of this shit. I argued the shit I argued the shit with. I bet you, I know you did Neil Degrass. I Know you did Because science and creativity is just, eh, I think there's parallels but it's a it's a fight.


It's a fight. What else we got? That was interesting. Yeah, that was fun. Yeah, It was fun. Sorry to get all Ice ice on the big shroom. Yeah, he not Playing. He not playing that nigga. I, He's been working on this theory for A while. He took the chocolate coat, his Trolls. You got like a lab coat when you come up with these shits, Goggles and shit. Yeah. Yeah. It's gonna Freeze. What else is important? Unimportant. What else is going on up there? We talk, we, we, we, we briefly touched on it on the Patreon because the verdict came down in real time. But we do want to clap it up for ASAP Rocky. For sure. Yeah. Lemme hit the round of applause. Yes, Did.

Let's talk about it List. Gotta love a list man. I like this list. 'cause at least It is 21st century. It's not of all time. Where where they do the bullshit. They nominate themselves to say some bullshit. Okay. The 21st century at least lessens the bullshit to me a little bit. Let's see here. All right. Oh, 20 is cut off on my list. So I don't know what 20 is.


I don't know what number 20 is. Alright, 19 is scissor, snooze, Grace. Old 19. 19 is crazy. You put 18 cranes in the sky. Solange Might be higher, should be higher. Both of those should be higher. 17. We just talked about this. Tony Braxton. He wasn't man enough. All right, what's the 21st Century again? That song I don't believe should be there. Hold On. Didn't that come on in the nineties? It did. No, it's No, I don't think so. I don't think so. That wasn't on. I think that's the early 2000 Secrets album. We can just check it. We don't have, yeah. 21st Century is 2000 Starts at January 1st.


2001. Yes. Okay. 16 Pretty Wings. Grace Over It is an Amazing song. What's Pretty Winks? Maxwell Aswell Maxwell. Oh that can get the fuck outta here too. All right, I gotta hear the, I didn't see the List yet. 14, I mean 15. Rock The Boat. Aaliyah 14. Love on Top. Beyonce. Okay. 13. Best part I'm assuming that is best part is Daniel Caesar and her. Well maybe that Was a good song. Best part is Daniel Caesar and that Right. A really good song. Yes. That's high for that 12 Fronting Pharrell that can go, that's Not that that Can get, It's not RB 11 Adorn.


Love that. That was a top 20 song. 10 Full Moon Brandy. I could go with That. I'm not mad at it. I can Go With that Nine Bag Lady Chias Sack edit. That's the one that you heard. Oh, okay. But no, not not Top 10 Bag Lady. That top that's, that's the, yeah, I won't, I won't vote it off yet. That's Erica Badu shit. I might say on and on before I say Bag Lady. Anyway, on and on. Might've been nineties. So It was the nineties. You right it was the That was 97. That Was the nineties. On and on. Eight Ordinary People, John Legend. Yes, Yes, yes. Okay. That's up Fox Song Joe, stop.


Box's Huge. I don about number eight. It should make the top 20 if some of them other songs made the top 20. I'm arguing with some of the songs that came before This. Yeah, me too. Me too. I'll put Asterisk next to Ordinary People. 'cause It is a beautiful song that's timeless and can be played. Yes. And it's a huge song forever. I just don't know yet. But we'll see. Seven Falling Alicia Keys. Nope. No issue for me. No, Not at all. Not at all. Six Thinking about you, Frank Ocean. Kind of High, but I love that record. Five. We Belong Together. Four. Mary, be Without You. Three Dangerously in Love. Two Dangerously in Love. Two.


Two. DeAngelo Untitled. Yes. One. Confessions. Confessions. Part two. That concludes the 20 best. 20 greatest R B songs of the 21st Century. I still don't know what number 20 is gentlemen, what do you Think? Number 20 was Michael Jackson. You Rock My World. It's actually a hundred. The list is a hundred but number 20 is Michael Jackson. You Rock My World. I believe that Frank Ocean Novocaine is better than at least seven of these songs. I Agree. But they got the representation with thinking about you in there. I'm not, I'm not super mad at that.


I don't think thinking about you holds a candle to Novocaine or Pyramids. Pyramids might not be RB all the way. Yeah, I don. I Wouldn't put Okay then Novocaine. Novocaine for Sure. Yeah. Thinking about you should not be in the same classroom as Novocaine. I love thinking about that. To me, I think Novocaine is one of the greatest songs Yes to happen since 2001. Maybe I'm biased 'cause I got a classic to it. But that song is better than at least seven of these. That's my only entry that I feel like was severely missed. I'm Gonna give you just real quick because like I said It is a hundred. I'm gonna give you 30 to 20 real fast. I'm looking at the top 50 and some of the songs in the top 50 should have been way higher.


Shoulda been higher than some of them songs in top. Give it to Let hear. Alright, you can go ahead since you go ahead. You got it. No, go ahead. You got 50. I'm like they bugging, they got Jagged Edge. Let's get Married at 43. Let's Get Married is a top 25 RB record at 43. I think some of those songs on that Top 20 list, that song is better than I agree. A agreed. What else you got So Sick by Neo. Great Song. I wanted to say it's a really good song. I wanted to say Neo Sexy Love. Sexy Love is an amazing song. Sexy Love. So Sick is probably his biggest song though. So I think that would be, I would be shocked if so Sick was bigger Than I'm just saying.


But maybe lemme see if it's the list for some of the songs that were in the Top 20. Music Soul Child Love is a big song that should Be higher where I am. I agree. You get what I'm saying. Love is better than Keisha Cole love a few of these songs on here. Keisha Cole. They not going. They're not going. They got credit her with the top 20 join of the 21st Century. They Got Snow. I want you around as number 37. It's a great song. It's a great song. It's a great song this century. So Carl Thomas, Carl Thomas. What I wish Carl Thomas shouldn't have nothing in his two thousands. Oh shit. I wish it was early two Thousands. I wish It is oh one, right? It's 2000. It says got Cisco Incomplete.


It is 76. That should be way Oh, time out. Stop the press. Fantasia. I see you. Damn. Where's that at? It's not what Fantasia. I see you is damn near 33. Damn. That should definitely be higher. Way higher bro. I see you. Comes on right now. The club stops Absolutely and sings at and Everybody, the chick that was staring at you all night now got an excuse to stare at you across the bar. I Also don't think Pretty Wings is in Maxwell's top three songs that neither should be on it. I don't neither. I know it's beautiful. Just for Matt, I think he has other records that should be nominated for top 20 of the century. I do. I look at the artist as like just a representation enough and they picked one of their really good solos.


So I'm not really super mad at Pretty Wings. I see what you're saying. You know what I'm saying? I'm with you. They went to the right artist but they tried to get too jiggy with it and they wanted to pick a joint that let you knew that they knew music or something. Yeah. Pretty Wins is Fire though. I love that. Rock Heavy Damaged on it. I don't know. I don't have a list of Oh Yeah, her Damage. You love that song. Her Damage. Stop playing man. Mute. Stop it. Yeah, I I haven't seen it yet. Stop it. Her damage is better than probably half This list. I'm not Gonna lie to you. Ain't the top 50. 'cause I went from 50 down. It's not the top 50. I just wrote Hundred down. I'm taking Damage over Snooze. He wasn't man enough for me. Pretty Wings.


Love on Top. That's me. I know the ladies rep for it, but I'm taking damage over that best part. Fronting Bad Lady. Yeah. I'm not playing with these people. Not confess, I'm, I'm not doing this Rolling Stone Confession. I'm not even mad at Confessions being the top five song. That was a huge song, bro. It shouldn't Be. That was a very big song. It's hard to find a better, bigger song than confession. I'm not mad at it. I, I named My Joints Novocaine Damage and something else I said, I don't know. I don't know. But listen, I, I like the idea of the list. I think we kill lists so much and we don't encourage, like this one wants new ideas.


I only see One. I only see one Her song on here. I'm at 64 and it's every kind way. Stop it. Alright. I'm done with them now. Well the best part, hers on this song. True. Every Conaway was a really good song too. I think. I think people might like that song More than Damage. You just love damage. Oh my God, boy you love Damage Fan. No, no. I'm saying no to that. Okay. And yes, I believe damage is what It is. Yeah. Out the cardiac. That amazing. I watched that whole La Reid interview. That was great. It was right. That was really great. I loved at the beginning when he was talking about for up and coming artists and people that wanna be in music industry being of service to people.


Like that was like the most valuable lesson in any type of career. Honestly. Like being out for self is not gonna get you, it's not a way to do it as far as being valuable for others to people around you or potential employers or collaborators or whatever. I just told flip that last week. Yeah. I'm not joking. What did you say last week? Last week you looked at me and you was like, yo, you know the number I want to get to and you told me how I can get to it. Yes. And I, and I was like, that's why we need the group, the group escape the room. So you can see what I'm saying. I think everybody can get to any number that they want. It just depends on the rest of the people in the room.


You said that, but It depends on the team. The, as a as a whole. Yeah. So there's nothing one person could come in here and do. And it be that it's about cohesiveness. The power of the power of the collective is always greater than the power of one. But then That means, that means that, But hold on, the sum is greater than the parts Are you talking that fly Shit. But here's the thing. So that means if if, if a couple of people are doing bad that that makes, Then we gotta pick up the slack. All the Suffer. Yes. But then I'm being held responsible for the for because there's no IT but we being held. So yeah, I'm being held responsible for others. Correct. Yeah. So if I come up here and kill or if somebody come up here and kill and say I'm doing bullshit, that means that the person that's killing does not deserve to get paid more because I'm doing bullshit.


So now my behavior is affecting them. No. Your behavior's affecting the show overall. Yes. How could everyone get paid? How could anyone get paid more if the show isn't making more money? The show we all have to write. If someone is having a bad day up here, we all gotta better Get up for them. The but the show could be making more money. I don't know. Okay. The sum is greater than the parts. Come on. Come on Justice. Word stop. I Fucking No, it's real Shit. It's, it's, it sounds good but it's just, it's just words. It's true. It's just words. The match. It's not just words. It's not just words. Okay. The show could still be making In the, the episode that you went absolutely crazy. And stop, Joe, if I'm on the total opposite side and fucked it up the whole episode, then what do you think the premise is? What do you, what do you think the tone out there is?


Is it Flip Went crazy or Joe fucked it up? Joe fucked It up. So whatcha you talking about? Here's the thing. It is the Joe button Show podcast number one. Number two, the show really lies. I mean we, we are here and we contribute and, and salute. But the show really relies, the audience really relies on you to deliver it's number. That's, that's number two. So even if I'm up here doing bad, you can still say, yo, the collective, you could still tell the collective, yo he's doing bad so nobody can get a raise. Which would be unfair and it would be an excuse because the show really relies on you. It wouldn't be an excuse. The only any one of y all could come in here and do bad enough to lose subs and lose money while other niggas is killing.


And then it, I could be playing the best spa game of my life if my partner Rene Game over and the rules that I play. Got it. Okay. I it's not that three book shit that people do. I could be busting my ass playing the best game I ever played. The second my partner play out of turn or do something stupid. We lose what I what am I'm gonna say It's a contradiction. Joe, what you saying? I'm telling you because I'm off. Tell me. I think Using him as an example is a bad example. I didn't wanna do that. I don wanted to take me outta Use or ice myself from Melissa. Better. This is but this is why it wouldn't work in this situation. This is why that what this is, why you telling me if him telling me that And I said my man would be smoking mirrors. I heard you tell somebody on Flip the network that swore they was showing up and busting ass and giving it they oil that they lost you a lot of money.


They Did. I Heard you say that. They lost. Yes. No matter how you was performing, no matter how anybody else was performing, one person came and whatever they did lost you money. They lost me money. The money that I invested, but not the money that I was making from doing Queen Flip shit. The people that came to see me came to watch me put these people together and we fucked with and we trust his vision. But if somebody fuck up, they say, well if Flip keep bringing him on there, I may not watch the next time. But that doesn't, that doesn't, that doesn't put a hole in my overall business. I just lost a lot of money investing in you niggas. That means that when I bought, when I flew you out here, I put you in the Airbnb. I did all that. I wasn't able to make ROI but my overall business is not fucked up.


That means that because you fucked up and you didn't make me a profit, I can't give you more money that you asking for. He's right. It wouldn't work here Though. He's right. In an instance that he described, he's right. But I don't think he's right. So let's just say take it off of this show. He can't take it off the show. Yo, let me, I got you dog. I'm on your team. I know baby. We can, Let's say hypothetical, if you don't mind. Let's say Imani did something on the last episode or in the room so he can tell Imani, Let's say don't listen. Look Bro, he could tell Imani, yo, you can't get a raise because of what you did. So let's say all the other people in that room performed above their standard. He can give everybody else in that raise.


I'm in that room a raise based on their individual contribution to performance. But Imani, if Imani did something detrimental to the show, Imani, don't get a Raise. I paint that totally different. Detrimental to the show can mean detrimental to whoever is financing the show. True. So if Imani does something stupid, that's what you're saying. And it and it's detrimental. The way I'm painting it that affects the overall bottom line, which affects the overall pay of the show. Everybody, everybody. No, Sorry, I don't wanna be circular Joe. We Could disagree to disagree. Disagree. I just view it differently than, than y'all do. But We have to agree to disagree on that one. Trust me, I done fucked up enough group situations to know that my, my lone voice, no can fuck up.


How this goes for Everybody, you fucked them enough group situations to prevent yourself from getting fucked up by a group situation. Hold on. That's the difference. Quick Question. Quick question. Sorry. What Say that sorry, real quick. Real quick. Use my example. Let's just say Imani does something dumb on the show, right? And it's considered dumb to the corporate side of things, but it also garners more views, which in turn brings in more money. Yes. Would I still be required to ask for some level of raise because even though I did something dumb, it Still was profitable with the show. Answer That. It's a great Question. Yes and no. I, yeah, I say no to that. Yes. And I would say no. You may get, you may get a raise, but if, if my, if my projection, if, if I lose sponsorship, if I gain money from people watching, but the sponsors sponsorship, the sponsors no longer want to invest because they labeled a show as, or now I gotta hire security.


I gotta do Yeah. Better paperwork, better lawyers. Or, Or even, or even if the sponsorship don't go, you might get higher sponsorship based on the dumb shit you Did. Right? True, true. That Coulda still went sour. You gave We got Luck, we got lucky and it went up. It true. Yeah. Got luck my nigga. You got But still now. But what, what happens now is that okay now people that wanted to do it for the challenge is now looking at it as oh you want niggas in there to fight. So it it, it fucks it. It puts you in a category that you may not want to be in because the category could just lead you. But so far yeah, so then now you have to do a whole say I'm sorry, I'm sorry. No, I'm done.


No, I'm just letting you, Is this, is this one of these moments? I mean I'm not gonna say that It is positivity, the eyeliner, Positivity. Eyelight My nigga. Stop playing With you. Stop playing. I ain't gonna shit. My man wanna speak. Speak nigga. Fuck that. I got, I got you. Just, you just in closing for me. I feel like you, you have, I said this before, nigga be on his Yoda shit. You Yeah, yeah. You good. You said that Yo, my voice has messed things up for groups before my, my voice is that powerful And I feel like you put yourself in a position where you will not allow a group to mess up anything for you. In closing for me, I feel like I watch you and I feel like you, you clever. Yes. You'll take, yes you take chances with your niggas and yes, certain things could happen but you put the business first and if you have to amputate a leg, you will in order to save the business you and you won't allow it to go that far.


Give you, I give you way more credit, you way more business savvy than you come off. You just let them niggas say, oh you don't know you gonna be hiring friends but you gotta figure it out. You gotta figure it out. I watch you very closely and not envious. Watch, I watch you as I'm impressed. This is why I can go on to flip the networks by from learning up here and give them niggas like, yo, y'all niggas is bugging you. Y'all niggas is losing me money and you can't ask for this. Even if the queen's flip is making the money you niggas is not making me additional money 'cause I'm making money just being queen flip. But where's the additional money that you're supposed to bring And Thank you guys for not losing me any money. So, And closing. That's fine. Shout the fuck the network though. Stop playing with them 'cause you be coming up there called it stir shout out to Them.


Beautiful segue to LaVar Ball having an amputate his leg. Damn. Yes. I may hit the round of applause because that's a great thing. Does anybody know what the Yeah, diabetes? I don't know. I don't know. We could look it up. They didn't say, They didn't say, they didn't say medical Condition. They didn't have to say for me, if they cutting your leg off then we need to do this so shit don't spread throughout your body and you can live whatever It is. I don't know. So and he looked like it took it like a champ picture. I've Seen he was smiling his as so he Said smiling this same with his kids like, and I'm just seeing shit differently after that. Full body RI shit. Yeah, I bet you see some shit and one of the options is cutting the leg off then bet you Buy.


Golly wow. Cut the leg off, Get the chainsaw. I did it. I did all I could do with a leg. Yeah. And I'm gonna get around a little faster now on my little nub scooter. They got some Brady get the nice little fancy metal leg, shit. Nah, that shit ain't metal no more. They got the fiberglass shit. That shit Your foot? Yeah, they got shit that beat. This your complexion? Yeah. Oh, I'll take a little Iron Man leg. There you Go. Shit might hit That. That's A strong one. That Was kind of Y'all, y'all, y'all talked about, you know, views and numbers and stuff. The, the first week numbers are in for Drake and Party DO'S album. Yeah. Clean It up.


What's the official what, Two 50? That's not official but that's where, that's Where It is. The projection says project 50. Official projection. The official should be in sometime later today. But we got enough to work off of. Yeah, Yeah. My my, my projection was wrong. My projection was right. You know I, I had him at one 20. I said double One 50 to two 50 he get the maximum. Hey you still, I'm still taking a W four Salute. That's a, that's a win. I said 180 to two 50 Salute Finally feels good to be right. I've been wrong. I've been on a nice stretch of wrong. It do feel good to get one back in the, in the correct playbook. So yeah.


Projection two 50. It's not so shocking to Me. No, not really. It's not so shocking to me. Look Man number one album, you know It is Drake still guys. No, but I'm just saying I think it's, we didn't spend no, no real money outside of anything on this. We didn't spend no crazy marketing budget. So true. Two 50 coming back. It is still a win. Yeah, It is a win. Yeah. Yeah. Like I'm saying oh he didn't do 400 and then It is a flop. Yo yo y'all don't know what people paid and they have their projections. If it falls in that range, they good. Right. So I salute to them. Yeah. Nothing about It's still like Parks, it's still Drake. It's still Drake. Like people have taken this battle and we've set it up here and people still think that we're like preying on his downfall or whatever.


Drake is still Drake and Drake is going to continue to be Drake. He's gonna sell records like he looked lost a battle. It's not the end of the fucking world. His career is not over. He doesn't have to go into fucking hiding. He books on records. I get niggas getting on me for calling him a corpse. Some people misunderstood that but I meant Corpse Drake as you knew him, is no longer we in a new chapter. We in a new chapter of Drake. But that's still Drake. Yeah. So like I was telling Ish anything below a certain number was gonna make me look at him like, oh hey it's a little worse than I thought but two 50 is respectable. Yeah, absolutely. Especially on a collab album. Yeah. Gimme what y'all think he'll do on a solo project. I saw Act make a prediction that if he just gives it six months, 500 k easy.


I think it depends on what the first single sound like. Yeah. Yeah. I wouldn't say easy If he put Out no single Surprise drop. Nah, like a cold type of Situation. Single surprise drop in What Call it August. Is it Good though? Music 400 Like It is. It is. It is. Drake we looking for honestly never Mind. I'm not gonna say that. I'm gonna say it's good music. I think this party shit was good music. Alright, So So one to 10 Drake. Right? Let's just say on a one to 10 scale with Drake, if he puts out a a seven and a half In quality, Quality Drake project 400, 400, 400, 400, he can do 400 Easy. Because I think what happens is the very first day and from what I've been seeing, y'all know this is not my my wheelhouse, but from what I've been seeing when the album drops, everybody goes to social media and if everybody on social media saying this shit is fire, this shit is crazy, this shit is this shit, shit is that, I think the album picks up steam.


You know what I'm saying? The niggas in the social media be like eh, I think that shit will lose steam. And If it also It is if regardless of social media, if it's good music, people will listen to it again. I know I will. It is that far like, like if, if I like the album, I'm gonna keep listening to it. I don't give a fuck what social media Says. If it's good music, social media will say It is good. The people outside will say It is good. The people at work will say good, it's gonna get picked up on Radio. It's back to the button conversation in the LA read thing too. It's Good. I don't put that much power in social media. I think social media is a small community. Same in terms of who you looking for when you trying to get them to purchase a project. Agreed. You want hit down media but you want hit everybody else too and they don't affect the real world like think they do. Agreed. That's what I keep saying. Listen, the people that's using social media right, they working when they on there they working.


Yep. Like even with the 50 posts, I think it's work. I think I got shows, I got shows down, I ain't got nothing going on. I'm gonna hit this algorithm the way I hit it. I don't like believe none of it. You Think you gonna go after old girl Megan? Yeah. No I don't think he will. I don't think he will. Megan who? Cunniff Megan. Oh. 'cause it hit the buzz. Apparently she was Saying, he said he had 500,000 that he said he would bet he's betting 500,000 that ASAP would beat the case. And she jumped in the comments and said I'll take that bet. But that's not, That's not, nah. She said he never took the bet.


That's what she said. I'm not paying him because he never officially took the bet. I hate people like that too. By the way. If you say bet and I say bet I took the bet if I got a, if I'm bored enough and got a lawyer that's just willing to play around, Stop. I don't think so. I don, I don, I don't think he has a case. I also respectfully, that's not a, She's A journalist. I'm sure she doesn't have an extra five just in the laying around. I don't know her personal life. Maybe she's a millionaire but I don't think suing the journalist is gonna get you your fucking bread. Fuck the bread. But hold on. You said that's, you don't think that's he has a case Against her for this? No. Why not? A legal case? Yeah, why not? It's like a, that's like a written What you going do you take me to court for ass better?


I don't think I Don and And who says that that was her? No, like it ain't no legally binding contract. Yeah. Okay. I, Because you never even know what state they made the things in. It could be an legal betting Like somebody as as big as 50 cent pause. He might not even work his own socials. Which Is plausible. No that's Him. I'm saying I'm giving you an exam that's plausible deniability. It wasn't me, it was my assistant. It was, You know what I mean? Whomever the case may be, you can't prove it was him And anybody could say that about this social shit. Right. I understand. Just asking. I understand.

He seems to have done away with that congestive pricing stuff that was crippling the city. Fake news. Let me ask you a question. What's up all Antoine? How do you feel About that Joseph? I think it's great man. The congestive pricing totals was coming up to 4, 5, 6, 7 grand in yearly costs for different families in this economy. You asking for you asking for a lot of people. I think New York has been doing a phenomenal job in recent years of just trying to get rid of the middle class, the lower class and just keep only a certain class citizen. I don't think that's right at all. Not with the way the economy itself. Right. You Need to ask a follow up question. Yo. People work at, people work in the city, everybody don't have $9 to enter.


That's that's, that's exit. Like I don't know Google the rules yourself but that's a lot man. So glad that Trump finally stepped in.

The people that parking being available. I did Read something though. The shoppers on. I know being sarcastic, being able to shop and peace with elbow room and space. Like all the people that had $9 to I ain't gonna hold you nine do that might have been the best $9 I ever spent. Fine, Here we go. Fuck it. Y'all got real to real. Y'all got it outta me. You got me?

Lemme see what that Filipino nigga doing. That mustache. Lemme see. Oh he got an Asian mustache Rush hour too. Yo nigga Bro, you a fool bro. Yo, here's my question to y'all. I'll go through a little bit of sports really quick. Who's ready for the worst sports take you ever heard? Alright, running back on the Buffalo Bills, James Cook wants $15 million to return.


How many years? He didn't say for years. He said this conversation starts at at 15. $15 million per year for reference I think Sequan gets 13, 12. 12 to change. Yeah. So we're maybe 13 to change. I think it's 13 to change. Christian McCaffrey is at the 15 number I think. Hey Is Do y'all think that James Cook of the Buffalo Bills should and will get $15 million from them? I think he should. I don't think he will. I Don't think he will. I think he should and I think he'll get really close even if he don't get 15 he might get 14, 13, 3, something like that. Yeah, like he's tough bro. Yeah, yeah he's good. I'm Not mad at him starting here.


It's not about him being tough, it's just about what the ceiling is and and how running back pay is viewed. Yep. I do think that again, like I said, Jamir, Gibbs b John Robinson, Saquon Christian, the top running backs now the way they look Derrick Henry re even for sure they look like they could change what running back pay will be in the future. I Agree. They're working on it. They're Working on it the same way quarterbacks did the same way receivers did. I think that the running Backs and I think James Cook just happens to be in line to benefit from what some of the top running backs in the league are paid currently. I just don't know that they're giving him 15. I still don't see, I don't See that the, they could change that. We've had running backs get really big deals and then not perform and that's what the owners and them are gonna keep saying like yo, They're not gonna say it to this crop of running backs.


They can't say that. And not Just that. We just seen Danny do Get 40 million and not perform. That ain't gonna stop no Quarterbacks a white boy quarterback from Duke, let's keep it on the running backs. They not gonna say that to Sequan when it's his time again. They certainly won't say it to Bijan. Who's up next year with Jamir Gibbs watch what them two do next year. Them two gonna change. You can't say to them them Two Yeah. Yeah them two. I don't Think It is. All it take is is the top two for the field to be changed. I don't, I don't know if Cook is not in that conversation with them. Two, to be totally honest, He's not. Ain't far from it bro. That buffalo Offense don't go without him. It's a big, a big running back yo Draft nigga not That's a good point.


Very good point. They gonna let Know they're not paying running Backs. Be's a make it a little tricky. If there's any time I'm gonna ask, I'm my ask right now. Yeah for sure. Absolutely. I'm literally, I'm not mad at the ask. So again, even if he shot at 15 and his number really might be 12, you know what I'm saying? If you shoot 15 and land at 13, I may say qua money Right. He might really take 12 and I hope he gets paid. Me too. He might take 12. I I do hope he gets paid in other sports news. SGA has fired his agent and will be representing himself Brilliant. Will be representing himself for his new $300 million contract that he is will be eligible for. Yeah.


He don't need it. Yeah nigga ain't nothing to discuss with me. What, honestly speaking, what do I need the agent for to negotiate my contract At his value? At his value? He's a max NBA player. It ain't no, it ain't no question. Ain't talking about I don't, I don't wanna be ignorant 'cause that's all, that's a lot of money. Might be above my pay grade. True. But I'm with you like Ray Allen if I'm him. I don't need an agent. Nope. To say Max me. Yeah, Ray Allen used to hire attorneys so Ray Allen would hire six seven attorneys at $500 a hour to negotiate his shit and do all his paperwork and all of that and made out way cheaper to give an agent three or 4%. And he has good relationship with OKC and the NBA. Yeah. Yeah. He'll be fine. It would be different if he was in a, in a shitty relationship with them.


He'll Be good. The agents will come in like for endorsement deals and all that shit. Their value is showing more there. But as far as him and the and and the OKC, he don't need no fucking agent. Their, their first offer gonna be Right. He gonna be all pro first team. I got two more for y'all. What does everybody here think of Anthony Edwards saying during All Star Weekend that he does not want to be the face of the league. He's saying leave that for Victor Ana who's also out for the rest of the season. The Spurs being slick again. Yep, for real. The Spur, the Spurs being slick again. Spurring What? Cooper? That's, they gonna end up, they gonna end up with Ace Bailey or somebody and there's gonna be a real problem over there. I like it. I like it.


Darren Fox, ACE Bailey or Cooper Flag Wi Women? Chris Paul and Stephan Castle bro. And They got a bunch of little young dudes that you don't know. They names Pop Tough. Yes. That All play ball bro. What's name? Devvin Vest? Devon Vest. Yo, they, they all play ball bro. They dude got Devon Vest. They got, They got nice team over there. Devvin vest nigga. He nice. He good. I don't know. Type Castle. Yeah. No, no. They, they got nice team. What do Y'all think about Anthony Edwards saying he does not wanna be the face of the league. Let's Brilliant. He just wanna play ball I think. I think his personality and who he is, he don't want that pressure on him. Yeah. That's what It is. Yeah. I don don't want that pressure on me bro. I don't want to be the face of the league. I don't want y'all to adopt me as the face of the league because now all that shit that happened with Ja and all like I don't Pressure.


I don want that Scrutiny. I don't want that pressure. All that shit Happen with Ja Like they were gearing, Ja ran around trying to shoot the 16-year-old white boys over birthday Parties. No he didn't. That's not what, that's not what happened. Y don't say that some Shit happened. Ja went to Foot Locker and pistol whipped the two little kids. Ja though Ja had a few incidents. He had Incidents where he flashed weapons. You're outta here. I'm not disagreeing. Don't say he pistol whip Nobody. No, I'm joking. Of course I'm saying so I'm just saying You can't flash weapons to be the face of the league. They got him outta there faster than I've ever seen them get a league candidate. Super. I'm agree with you. Yeah. So what I'm saying is if you, Anthony Edwards, you might not want that pressure Brett fam I want to be me. What I'm saying is I'm still a young wild nigga seen.


That's all I heard. I'm saying you seen the way you was talking to Obama. Who? Anthony Edwards. I Love it. I loved it. That that to me It is him. It is him. And I like the fact that he knows that and He couldn't be the face and he is the face of the league. He couldn't be, I don't think he has a choice in this matter. Exactly. And I think this is one of those incidents where young people don't realize that they don't have a choice and you're working within the, the design of something. Good Point. I think he Don't have a choice. You can't say I don't want to be the face of the league. And I've seen multiple people echo this across the inter interwebs. You can't say I don't wanna be the face of the league and then be in 5, 6, 7 national ad campaigns. The behavior and the words don't match. You can't be the face of Sprite, the face of Adidas or whatever your sneaker is.


The face of all these things. And then say I don't wanna be the face of the league. You're the face of the league. We have, we have you here. I think That's like you being signed to me as an artist. You popping everywhere that you going. When you get back to me, you say nah, I'm cool. I ain't really trying to sell records. You don't have a choice in this. Well I'm not trying to. It's gonna be label whim. Minna and Anthony Edwards, we just traded away our franchise player for the last 10 years who made $300 million. We didn't do that because we have Rudy Goldberg and and Julius Edwards. Yeah we did that because we have you. You are the face of the franchise. You are one of the young fresh faces of the league.


Partly because of how you carry it and all that shit. That is just you. So while you saying y'all, I'm just me. I don't want the spotlight on me. Guess what buddy spotlight's there Joe. He wanna still be on his fuck shit. That's it. He knows that and knows he's not ready to let go of that. I don't want that know, don't want clean up. This Gonna be on your fuck shit while you're the face of the league. Like He's gonna lose and one can't Slip is one of the faces of this league. And he's allowed to be on his fuck shit. But he was brought in, he was brought in with that and he was brought in to be that. You know, that dog didn't come and say There's limitations on the fuck shit. What we talking about is what we've seen. Fuck shit from Anthony Edward. As long as he don't flash no weapons, no guns and say nothing disrespectful about Chyna.


Why? Why? I'm sorry, why? Why? Why don't you respect the fact that he's taking the road to say like I don't want this responsibility. I do respect it. I just think he don't have a choice. I think he does. You do. You do That. That decision is not his And I think this comes off. That's a great point. I think It is his I think No it's not. Not no it it's not his. No it's not. It's not his. Not Adam s Silver was making A mistake. No, I think this comes off the last week conversation that we had with human lady and they pulled him in the office like, yo yo kip your dick in your pants, blah blah blah. I don't engage in all This stuff. If stuff, if it was the face they could have hid that information though. It's a lot of shit to get. No they couldn't have. Yeah. What Not today In today? Not in today's social media. We want to have An honest conversation or no. Yes. We want to have an honest conversation. It's a lot of shit to get hid by the faces. I believe that.


Or for a bunch of shit The out here for sure. True. But when a girl starts throwing that shit around and that shit gets snatched up real, real quick. They gotta pay a lot of motherfuckers Money. Yeah. They got your value has to be, oh we gotta suppress this and his value is not there yet. This is just him getting ahead of it. Yeah. That's how I look at it. I just told so now when some shit come out they, Hey I told y'all I didn't want to be the face of the league So leave me alone. The MA is not caring about what he's doing with his penis. Right this moment. It is way too much money on the line one for sure. Two, he has no say in how many nationally televised games. Adam Silver decides to give the 10 Wol. Correct. If I want to put you on 50, 50 times a year Yep.


Then I'm doing that and know what that does Make you voice Face if you wanted to face the League. Yeah. Yeah bro. They starving right now. Well he definitely won. Meet the face you Of them while we in our transition phase. Yes. He's gonna be, we gonna milk Curry and Durant and LeBron, LeBron and Brony until the time is up. But guess what? We nurturing the next crop of stars and you and you there. Yes, For Sure. I'm not disagreeing with that. I don't Care how many times he say I'm not the face of the league. That's what I'm saying. He's Just saying that to protect the fact he's saying that. 'cause he may really feel that and believe that. Yeah. Sorry buddy. I don't, I don't want to tap dance for them And some motherfuckers not beat to do that. I mean, you're already tapped dancing. You Tap dancing Already. You're doing it. You save young Glover a little bit. You're playing the game already. Sure. I disagree but okay.


You disagree with the he's tap dancing part Yo have you, have you Ever seen, you're not gonna go do shit. Have Commercial, have ever seen an interview of his And say, I don't wanna do commercial. Have you ever seen his interview? That's true. Yeah. You seen him interview? Yeah. Yeah. He ain't the most PC nigga in the interviews. So he a young Georgia nigga that really be giving it up in them interviews. Yeah. But he is in the, in the commercials. He's different in the end different. He's not talking and doing all that shit in the commercials. My real feelings don't come across when I'm doing a Sprite commercial. Did y watch commercial Cos go a lot? The commercial go a lot further than post game interviews. Did Y'all watch the, the starting five series on Netflix? Yeah, I didn Did you see him? Did you see him on there? Yep. I didn't finish it so I don't wanna comment. That's The, that's what the Obama started. That's who he is. That's who he is. And nobody's arguing who he is and it's, I think we all in agreeance with who.


But I'm Saying him saying I don't wanna be the face of the league. It is just, It is who he is. So when I do my shit, I'm, it's almost like I'm protecting myself. That's it. He really don't have a say in the matter. Like you said he don't. Okay. That's all I, we wanna Make our star. That's regardless all I'm getting at, you could say you wanna say now if he want to go do something stupid enough, Get kicked to where, Alright, we not televising these games at eight o'clock on TNT and yada yada yada. And that's different. But I don't think he wanna do that because he's playing the game. Yeah. Yeah. He's Playing the game. That's what the top, you Can't say I'm playing the game and then say I don't wanna No, you're playing the game over here too. You signed here. You signed here. Right. Stay, stay there. Say less. You think John Morant wanted to be the face of the league? Yes. Yes He did.


Okay, cool. I'm so to your premise, if he didn't want to be the face, I mean if he wanted to be the face of the league, he wouldn't have been whipping out on niggas. That's Not justice in of circles. Not That's not true. That's the circle. Yeah. He had too much. You could still want something and also know How not to obtain it. And, and Ja Mor shouldn't have been talking not to bring up the Armani shit. Johnny Ja Morant shouldn't have been threatening the 16-year-old white boy of foot lock in the first place. Cool. You did that. They sat you down. They sat you down. They, they scolded you publicly. And guess what you did Two months later You did it again. You standing on top of a bullet again. You did a car and a video. You did it again. Pulling the things out.


Hey. And now Ja Morant may not have known it but we're going to hit the off button now and your entire life looks different. Yeah. Your entire life is different now. True. We didn't come tell you, Hey, we about to make your life look different. We just hit the button. I'm telling you that I can't tell you who's on the, on the grizzlies. And what I'm telling you is Jaa Ranch's check ain't changed. And Jaa Ranch's life may listen to what I'm saying to what he might deem a necessity has not changed. Yeah, But it That's point. But look to your point and that's not true. Maybe, Maybe not. If he didn't, if he did not want to be the face of the league, then he don't come make those AP apologetic statements either Though.


His game check didn't change. He Got a check, he got a check to get. No, you still got your Check still game service check. Yes. Everything else off the, I'm trying play a game now to stay. Y'all good Graces though. Alright. We, we, we moving along 'cause we stand in one spot bro. For a nigga from the bottom. Not saying that he is that for a nigga from the bottom, if I'm making $50 million a year, if I'm making $40 million a year, I don't gotta make $70 million a year to some people. But But you don't know what his Yeah. His personal goal was and for what the trajectory where they had him that fucked his life. I'm just, now's a good kid bro. I'm not disagreeing with you. Yeah, I'm saying we don't know what his wants and needs are. So for some people they would marvel at being Saying But he wanted that Kobe Spot though.


You're And that's why we telling and that's why we can speak to what his wants and needs were. 'cause we saw him want It. I'm not finished bro. What I'm telling you is I don't want you to finish. I know. We know. What I'm telling you is that might have been his want. Anthony Edwards could be saying, I don't want that shit. Everybody's wants ain't the same. Get Out despite commercial, get out the Adidas commercial. He's the, he's the face of Adidas, right? Yeah. One of them. Yeah. Yeah. Don't go. What you're saying makes sense. Yeah. Come on.

And if I'm a Adam silver and the GDP of the NB is fucked up, you have no choice until we find I'm leaning on you.


For sure. You have no choice. I'm on your side without, I don't even need your consent. Yeah. Right. Yeah.

Tony Rico foul to withdraw from representing Sean Combs writing cryptically. Under no circumstances can I continue to effectively serve as counsel for Sean Combs consistent with the a BA standards for criminal Justice. There's a whole sheet that went out on this. Come On dog. He ain't have to do that dude. He seems to be relieved there. Counsel for Sean Combs as a result of discussions with lead counsel Mark Agi. I might be fucking that up. This motion for the withdrawal of counsel is filed. While I am aware that the local rule requires that an application for withdrawal of counsel is supported and granted only upon a showing by affidavit or otherwise of satisfactory reasons for withdrawal, there are sufficient reasons related to the protections afforded by the attorney-client privilege for brevity in my application for withdrawal as counsel in this case, although I have provided Sean cones with a high level of legal representation expected by the court under nurse, no circumstance can I continue to effectively serve as counsel for Sean Combs consistent with yada yada y like I already read.


Oh, alright gentlemen. It looks crazy. That's, that's it. Don't sound great. Yeah, that don't sound it don't sound great. Think It is some shit that he might have saw. It sounds like, yo, I came across some information. Yeah. That I Can't even, that is Damning and morally I can't fuck with you and how that's worded. It's just what I want my defense attorneys to come with morals like We Need, nigga we don't get in here and defend me. I asked y'all Asked y'all that question before on here. If you were, could you do it? Some people can't. Could I do? What If you knew for a fact that the client did it and you were the lawyer?


'cause you represent 'em as a defense lawyer. You should, as a defense lawyer, shouldn't be defense. You Know that every client you have isn't gonna end up being innocent. You shouldn't be a defense attorney. Yeah. Right. But it's, it's, I think you could be a defense attorney and then again, it could be just something personally that bothers you as a person that you just can't fuck with. I just feel like as a, as takes certain, it ain't blanket when you take certain oaths like a doctor and like when a doctor has a criminal on his table, he still has to save that criminal. Like you took that oath to to be a lawyer and you know that you're gonna end up defending some people who've done some horrible things. You're gonna have to Oh Yeah. To take that oath. Seriously. Pick, pick a different branch of law. Go into, but even It is criminals and corporate law.


Like you gotta go into law because again, if a murderer comes into your office and they murdered somebody, you gonna give him, you gonna give him 50 50 of your, your skills. I think he came across some information that knew he couldn't win the case. He might've. So you wanna keep your record clean and don't go down history as the dude that lost, but then don't Yeah, but don't do that. Don't, don't do all but don't do that public shit. That was nasty. Yeah. If that's the case, that's nasty. Call I'm if if it's something where Puff might A cursor. What was nasty? The public statement. The public statement. That way he Didn't make a public statement. That statement that you just read. What you just read. It is his public statement. It's public because the statement is public once you file it.


He didn't open notes. Oh, that was a petition to the judge. Okay. That was to the judge. But he could, and that's made public so people can read it. And he knows that at this higher level Choice State. I get it. He Has no Choice. He has no choice. I'm withdrawing. I thought that was just like a press release. That's Yeah. No, this, this is not a press release. Not to say that he won't do one, but this is not that. Okay. I I took that the wrong way. I think that's still horrible giving it to the judge. No, I gotta give it to the judge. Straight pause. I disagree. But let's go. In order for you to be withdrawn from a case could like that you have to have reason. Like He could have said it's a conflict of interest. He could have said, you know, a a number of different things that even if it, let's just say hypothetically and that sound like I'm caping for puff. I'm not, again, I'm being objective.


If, if this is the judge that's going to oversee the case. Right. So now you say that to that judge. You just could have potentially put a, planted a seed to that judge that the defendant is on bullshit and I can't represent him no more. The judge definitely like, all right, let me look for it. Would that be, I disagree with that. Would that be on ethical? But also isn't there a jury? So I disagree with that. I mean The judge is important, but yeah, The judge is there to be a judge and part of being a judge is impartial. You can't plant a seed with me, do that shit with everybody else.
