I for one, cannot believe that they're selling puff freak off tapes in Los Angeles. Excuse me. Underground. That's Crazy. I'm blown away by that. I don't know why. Why? Yeah.

(18m 20s):
They sold R Kelly tape in the barbershop above ground. Right. R Kelly tape was mass duplicated. The, the whole purpose of a freak off tape is for them to be for the scarcity. My thing is, Everybody should not have a freak off tape to sell. That's true. That's why it's it. Don't Take it, don't take everybody to get it. Just one person. A couple people. One or two. That's it. The exclusivity is why I could sell it. True. Y'all ain't got this or seen this. Pay for it. I mean I never doubt the hood. So the hood gonna find out who did it when they did it. Absolutely. The car. They was in the tape. We got the footage, the evidence.

(19m 0s):
We got a witness. You thought that r Kelly tape circulated. Let one of them put one of them out and watch what happened. Damn, there's so many people out there that wasn't old enough to remember when that R Kelly tape That. That's true. Right. There was people outside of my high school selling that shit. You couldn't avoid, you could not ask Trouble. Your child was a little trouble. Like they did need better protection systems in place to protect you in that little choir. High school you Were in. Yo, stop. Stop. you know what I mean? Seen the movies buddy. I know what happens to them. Little singing boys. Father Riley took you steps. Nice Singing boys too.

(19m 41s):
Hit the nose. That's how we started today. Alright, I see where You started. No, but go ahead. Go ahead. Yeah. Nah, you couldn't avoid the r Kelly tapes. Couldn't when they came out. Yeah. Even if you was trying to, when you went to the barbershop or somewhere, it was in Damn. Niggas didn't even know that you were watching technically child porn. You didn't even know it. I never watched it. That shit was everywhere. You never watched it. You said never seen it. But I remember when that shit was running around. It was crazy. Niggas was putting that shit on in the barber. Like, like I said in the barber shops, I don't really have a hot take other than I can't believe so many people have a freak off tape to sell in Los Angeles. How? And, and before I ever bought a free golf tape, nigga I need to see the trailer.

(20m 22s):
I believe it. I need to see the teaser. Don't step on my joke. I'm sorry. Clear out while I'm joking. I need to see the fucking credits, idiot. Yeah. Before I give my 10 99. Nah, the price gonna be high. That's Be 99. Nine thousands. But who on this One? Like, that's the thing. What's the cast? That's the Thing. They said The One that's getting leaked around is high profile. Somebody on there. Ooh. Monk. Supposedly. Supposedly. So you, They still haven't revealed who the person was. They said hide. They said hide the puff. Hide puff. That's enough for some folks. Oh Shit. No, they And they said you could clearly see the face. Yeah. Like It is undeniable But high profile and Puff is crazy. Yeah, It is, but I'm just, I'm shocked that it ain't, it ain't too many been released yet. I mean the person Yeah. If the tape is going around, what, What do you even do with that tape?

(21m 4s):
Like if the tape was going around, if somebody purchased it after you beat off, they would've told who the fuck is on it by now. Wait, what'd you say? I'm telling you that's what, that's what people are having these tapes For. You ain't crazy. What'd you right. Wait, hold on. Absolutely crazy just now. That's What happens with those. I Mean this is our Wednesday post. That Nigga said after they beat Off. That's what you'll buy it and do what to? Well, I mean it's like A whole bunch take, take that, take that. That's What you want. It's not just Puff in the tape. It's a bun. It's it's women and men and they're all oiled up like fucking sea lions. So why do you think people would Make He's porn. He oiling up. Shoot somebody. He he gotta be over somebody. Alright, we're moving on now.

(21m 44s):
We're moving on. We good now We're finished fast and we're moving on. We are done with this. Puff did hire two new attorneys and added them to his case And he need to drop that other dude. He talking too much. Nah. Other dude up there looking like he trying to send him away. Other dude Gimme Sudie vibes. Oh, max. Max Max to Max. He doing way too much bro. And it don't look like nothing's helping. Speaking of trials, the judge and the Young Thug trial. Yeah, she, she's just about had it. She ain't had it just about my ass. I've just about Well it Ain't just about The judge and the Young Thug trial really laid fire the ass on the prosecutors over. How and when they are choosing to disclose evidence into discovery and she went Ham, somebody had a clip.

(22m 30s):
She, She all But wait, why y'all find a clip? She all but accused them of in in intentionally doing this. Yeah, she did. Like she did like, yo y'all are no, she did trying to fuck this case up. My my Go ahead. No, no. I'm about to say and you could see it like the number of times that she stated that it happened. It was like, you leave me no choice but to assume. 'cause y'all have too many years experience doing this. Like I've seen y'all, we know each other here. What are you doing? Like y'all making it tough. I want to get 'em, we want to get 'em, you know that this, but y'all are fucking up us getting them. She basically told him, dog, this case is mad easy to try, y'all fucking it up. We want to send this nigga to jail but y'all gonna make me have to release him.

(23m 11s):
And I've never seen anything more unorganized. That's fucked Up. I just don't get how you do that. Still don't claim the mistrial. Yeah. What do you think happens after this? Yeah, if the judge is stating this in court, in open court that you guys have done this multiple times. Then now if I'm the, if I'm the defense, She ain. Biased to me, ain't nothing y'all can say Yeah, She ain biased to me now. Like you just gave me my appeal. Even if you do, even if you do convict. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Even if he goes, he has more than enough grounds for an appeal. I do have the clip. She's about to cry. I'm asking, I mean I can't figure out what It is. She's Disingenuous. If It is that, I mean I don't, I don't want to malign Good words, George.

(23m 57s):
Nice Work the prosecutor standing in front of me right now. So I'm not gonna say the possible things that it could be. But It is baffling to me that somebody with the number of years of experience that you have time after time after time continues to seemingly, purposefully hide the ball to the extent you possibly can for as long as you possibly can. And I really don't want to believe that It is purposeful, but honestly, after a certain number of times you start to wonder how it could be anything but that unless It is just that you are so unorganized that you are throwing this case together as you try it.

(24m 45s):
Hmm. Wow. And I'm sorry to say that, but She said that she, This case is being made much more difficult for everybody. That Sentence That is fucked Up because of the haphazard way in which It is being presented. I'm I'm gonna take a recess for a few minutes. Yeah. I'm so frustrated with you Jackie. When I get Back, lose your Biden. I I just don't get how you say all of that and don't rule a mistrial at that point. So question for you guys, 'cause we've been talking about this for a long time. Do you think that it's like ineptitude on the prosecutor's part or do you or intentional?

(25m 27s):
It's intentional. I think it's intentional. You think it's intentional? Of Course. Based on what even what the judge said, like dog, you ain't new here. It is not your first time at the rodeo. Y'all doing This shit on purpose and it's been multiple times that you guys have done This shit. Well The prosecutors, if if it's not ineptitude and it's deliberate, then the prosecutor like, is this is like a career making case, you know, for them. And so that might be the reason why that they're like, you know, giving discovery late or you know, whatever. But It's injustice. Yeah, but No, I know it's absolutely, And it implies that your case isn't so iron class. Yeah. It seems like it's injustice. They don't have enough shit to do this problem, bro. This is the what, second or third judge that has had to say something to this prosecution.

(26m 7s):
They're tired, they're Wiped out. This the bad part though. This sentence that she said like, y'all, y'all are making this case way more difficult. Implies that yo, y'all could have been, it's a weak case put, y'all could have been locked him up if y'all would've did everything right. I want y'all to lock him up. And the fact that she said, yo, I'll come back and have a ruling and didn't come back with a ruling to dismiss the case to me is bias. Yeah. She she got emotional, my nigga. She sound like she was about to cry. Like you can't be crying because the, the, the prosecution fucked up. Wait, you think that she was, you think that she was going to cry because she wants this, she wants him to go to jail. Like she wants the case wrapped up. Yeah. And him convicted.

(26m 48s):
I dunno about that. I think that she's, I think they want the case wrapped up Ed up period. But she had the ability to wrap it up. You could have came back and said, yo mistrial, this Case has been going on forever, but damn near Two years we older a hearing some change. Let's Get to what the fuck we gonna get to so we can get the hell outta here and and y'all move On. If y'all, If y'all can't, That's it. Let this boy go free. That's it. So I think that, I think it Was Yeah, but we can't decide that because we're stopping every other five minutes because of your infraction. Because of your, because of your negligence. Which means I should be able to go home and the judge, the Judge actually, well I'm also not wasting two years of State money taxpayers brand. They should not have the conviction.

(27m 28s):
Yeah. We not gonna, we not gonna, I'm not gonna mistrial this and then them and then them say, and then the prosecutor go to try to retry the case with state money or taxpayer money. Yeah, that's, no, we're gonna get to a verdict. And also at this point, the thug's attorneys are the ones that should have requested a They did, they did request. They did. Okay. I didn't hear that In the clip. That's, well that's, that's the very beginning of the clip. Okay. They beginning of this is not the first or second time that they've requested a mistrial. They keep doing it. Yeah. The judge is basically telling them, y'all fucking up so bad, y'all are leaving me no choice. And it's a lot of money. It's a lot of hours tied up in this. We, this is a massive l for us. If I have to declare a mistrial and that's where the unfair bias shit coming to me.

(28m 11s):
And for these reasons, yes. Like I'm not mad at a, a mistrial, but when I go have to put this in a docket, It is gonna say because the state just looked like ass, I wouldn't be surprised if the judge is literally doing that just because she don't wanna be a part of the case no more. Like, let me do whatever I can do to set myself, to accuse myself to recuse myself from this. Because This shit is gonna be, we gonna be doing this forever. I I don't even think it's that. Just be, if this was the first judge, then maybe yes. But again, this is the third judge on this case. Yeah. They getting on this case and it's so bad that it's like, bro, what are we doing here? If y'all not going to present This shit. Right. Y'all are leaving me no choice but to declare a mistrial. And I can't do, I literally cannot do that. It's so much taxpayer money and all This shit tied up here.

(28m 54s):
If you asking me today I say it looks like he gets out. I think they know he gets out but they're trying to. Yeah, it's like grasping at straws at this point. They can't get the, we can't justify letting, they can't turn the corner like they can't turn the corner. You know how like we watch TV and it's that one thing that'll You know what I mean.

(47m 25s):
Facts. That's true. And even beyond whatever turmoil they may have had, I feel like Yachty was just in a news cycle that he didn't wanna be a part of for several weeks in a row for shit that he said in the pod with the girl that was signed to him with all the shit, all the different shit. Drake unfollowed it. you know what I mean? It was a bunch of messy shit that came with him. Podcasting. Oh that's part that. Yeah. It is, that's It is. I don't care how much shit you and your little friend have been through. I don't care how many times you have stood tall, been in the trenches, gutted it out with someone. Yeah. Nothing is going to test that relationship.

(48m 6s):
Like starting a podcast. True. Take it from me. That's number one. Starting a business period. True. Yeah. But podcast, specifically A business center around talking about shit and people's business and Podcast specifically. 'cause it's such a new thing and don't nobody know what the fuck they talking about. So everybody think they know what the fuck they talking about. Everybody does. It's too many different ways to skin a cat in this instance. There's no, there's no, there's no path laid out. That is just for certain for everyone. So there's so many just contrasting and conflicting thoughts. Get on how to do things. I get it. Sometimes it can be a lot of chefs in the kitchen.

(48m 48s):
A lot of ego. Lot of ego. Lot of ego. Now we gotta have that uncomfortable split conversation that We talk about artists needing to have when you go in the studio and make a song with somebody.

(1h 2m 31s):
And I brought you about a week before She, I never got either job if I worked the Checkers, I don't remember. And it lasted for a day. 'cause at that point, I think I was trying to sell drugs too. So my plan was to sell drugs out the window of checkers. It's not a bad plan. That is wildly enterprising. It's not a bad Plan for a clumsy nigga. It's A bad plan, yo, nigga. Why? It's not a bad plan. If you know what you're doing, yo. Your dog. I was getting high with everybody in Jersey City and they all was coming to fucking checkers. So let me ask you this. So wait, you getting high and you gonna sell it? No, I'm not gonna get high at work, but I'm gonna sell drugs at Checkers.

(1h 8m 53s):
You lose. Well, lemme tell you about,

(1h 8m 55s):
Alright now, now I'll tell y'all about one of the greatest companies out there. God damn it. The fuck are y'all talking about? Look, I'm at the wrong shit. I am a shout PrizePicks the number one daily fantasy sports app in all of the land. Super easy and simple to get into. All you have to do is select two or more players. Look at their projected stat line and pick more or less for your chance to win and win big. Don't forget, they are, they are season long games that you can be a part of. So For Me, I'm going with Pat Mahomes for more than 4,300 pass yards. Even though that can look a little shady. Now He get there. I think he'll get there 'cause he's great. But Pacheco out Hollywood, brown out and Rashi Rice out. I wanted to see them arrest him. I didn't want him to get injured. I didn't. The injuries shouldn't have been what ended it. The, the fucking Kansas City Police Department. This is your second request. Should have got him outta there. He crashed the fucking Lambo and walked away and signed a autograph. He should have been gone. He, his fantasy teams had been killing. Stop. He out there putting up numbers. Call the cops. Stop. Hey, Hey, here's another tip one 800. Get that. Hey. Oh, come On. My name is Ted. I'm here to talk y'all about another Kind of tip. Yo, I loved, that's the greatest. That was great. And they got that money from that company. I'm glad his wife got that money from that company. It was 70, 70 million million. Congratulations. Let me hit the round of applause for that. That is important, alright, but PrizePicks does season long games. So I am going with Pat MoHos for more than 4,300 pass yards, even though that can look shady. I'm going with Aaron Rogers for more than 3,700 pass yards. Even though that too looks a little shady. It won't little. And I'm going for Tyreek Hill for more than 1300 pass yards, even though that can look a little shady. And I'm going with Saquon Barkley for more than 1050 rush yards. Even though with Nick Siri, No, no, that's in there. He got that. That's gonna get there. He got that. But, but that Tyre, Ty Tyre Got that too. Alright, if you sign up today, you get $50 instantly when you play $5. That's right. You don't even need to win to receive your $50 bonus. It is guaranteed. One K Williams passing yard gets you one win on PrizePicks. Oh, it's not September. It's Oh, it's over for that one. You're done. You're done. If you didn't bite last Month, if You didn't get in last month, It is over for that. Now. You just gotta go off your own thinking, your own strategic plan. Sorry for that. But don't forget to use promo code JBBB and run your game. Shout to all my good people over there. Prospects, man. Good people.

(1h 12m 5s):
Blockbuster NBA trade Friday night. Oh yeah, Yeah. Let's clap it up. Yeah, Come on. No, Clap it up. come on. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. Let's clap it up, man. Right. Blockbuster. Let's go. Nicks. I mean, y'all could go. No, I ain't feeling It is jovial. Well, It is y'all on this? It, it looks like Minnesota traded car. Anthony Towns over to the Knicks in exchange for Julius Randall and Dante Vincenzo. Man, my stomach has not stopped turning ever since. I'm in a real, I'm sick, y'all. I met you at the bar and you looked really sick. I That night. I'm under that. Hey, if didn didn't have this beautiful Cabo tan, I would look pale.

(1h 12m 48s):
If I didn't have this fucking luxurious Cabo tan that I got, I would look sick, pale, lacking my normal melanin under underprivileged, underserved. I am stunned by this. It hurts every time I search Nicks and boy have I been searching. You don't believe he's gonna help? I don't know Better. I don't know better. I don't know if Carl Anthony Townes is gonna help. I I'm, I have no prediction about how the Knicks will do on court because there's too many other new players. I didn't know what they was gonna look like before.

(1h 13m 28s):
Yeah. So please be clear. I am going to root Nicks always right, because I'm nick to my soul. But I don't feel good about the trade. I feel like Julius Randall and Dante embodied what the Knicks would've liked to represent, which is a certain toughness or certain bully ball type of, no matter what club, we won't back down odds stacked against us. And they performed that way when they were on the court. So to replace some of the heart and soul of your team, even though that's probably Jalen Bronson and Josh Hart. But to replace some of the heart and soul of your team with Kat, who kind of embodies a softness or everything.

(1h 14m 13s):
That is anti New York. It hurts. I'm not saying that he won't perform well, I'm not saying that it's not a better fit with Jalen Brunson and the new crop of Nicks. But as a diehard Nick fan, it's like, it's not just the championship, but it's like how you get the championship. So for y'all today, to be seemingly mirroring what the Celtics did with Zenge at the five, just would've been nice to see them try to get it their way. I, I wanted to see what Dante and Julius looked like with bridges and a healthy and a Nobie. Yeah. And an ob. Yeah. And a healthy Mitchell Robinson. So essentially what you're saying is, because if Mitchell Robinson never gets hurt, maybe this trade doesn't get done.

(1h 14m 58s):
If, if Hartenstein never leaves, then maybe this trade doesn't get done. So now you in a pickle because you don't have no five entering the season. You need someone And you need somebody. So I understand that aspect of it. And I get why Minnesota would want to get up off of this Minnesota heavy, heavy, heavy contract. And you got young rising stars who seem like they need the room to grow and explore without the nine year veteran here. So I get their side of this. Do you think I paid too much? No. Even with the, even with the draft picking answer. No, not at all. Not at all. He'll be underpaid in a matter of years. It's not the money. It's, this is not a money thing. No, I don't mean pay. I'm saying think the cap is gonna rise ex exponentially in the next three years.

(1h 15m 37s):
When I say paid, I just mean y'all gave up too much. That's all. Y don't think y'all gave up too for didn. Didn't wanna see Dante go, but coming off the best season he's ever had in his life. That's, yeah. Coming to him and saying, Hey, maybe you get a reduced role 'cause Bridges is here. Maybe he's not the happiest with that. I would've never wanted to see him in that trade. Ever. I think our bench is weaker. I think we have one of the best starting fives in the league. But with the bench, I think you need a bench. I don't know. I don't feel good. So You think It, the identity. The identity Loss. Identity loss. I think we lose on the bench. I think our starting five is great, but there are some injury issues. Mm. In there. I don't think we deep enough to survive that.

(1h 16m 18s):
If Kat goes down, I never wanna see Jericho Sims. Let me ask you. I say that with respect. He's developing shout, shout out to the Knicks for developing players. Shout out to the Knicks for this team. Looking totally different today than it did last year and years before. Shout out to them for finally making a move where it look like, all right, we all in now. That's what you wanna see from your team in the organization. I've never really seen that in a Dolan led Nick organization. So kudos to them for that. I have season tickets. I'm gonna enjoy every game and I'm certainly gonna root for Kat and everybody out there. But I'm gonna miss Julius Randall and Dante di Denzo Dito. I am. I just Like I, I like, to me, Tibs is gonna be able to pull something out of him that maybe other coaches Able The trade all relies on Tibs.

(1h 17m 4s):
For. Me. Yeah. It's all on Tibs to get Kat to play. Like we like New York players to play. He's coach him before. You have to think that he signed off on this. But man, man, I think Julius just represented such a mismatch for opposing teams. Like there was nothing nobody on the Pacers could do with him. There was nothing nobody on the Celtics could do with him. I saw it too many times. So we lose that mismatch and I'm looking forward to seeing what we gain with Kat being on the floor and the spacing and the shooting and all of This shit they talk about. But it just gotta be ready for if Minnesota media might have been a problem. Oh yeah. Oh Yeah. Buddy. Buckle your buckle your seatbelt.

(1h 17m 45s):
Yeah, that's all Monster. I'm saying he might come out here and And he might needed a new scenery. Yeah, he might. Yeah, that's true. I don't know. I don't know enough about him 'cause I've never fucked with, It's a difference. Scenery my nigga. But he might have needed a new scenery. Not this One. Come with a lot of pressure. Know He from here, he was here when he wasn't rich And he got tough niggas on his team. There's tough niggas on his team. O OG is tough and OG is probably gonna guard a lot of fives on most nights. He probably will. He has a coach. That is going to make him toughen up. That coach is not gonna let him just come over here and give us all skill. He's gonna have to play with some heart. I'm happy that we get to see Kat versus Embi a lot more.

(1h 18m 26s):
Yeah. Is Mitchell Robinson healthy? No. No. He won't be here in February. That matters. We're trading him. That matters. He's getting traded. I don't even know how I feel about that. I don't know. I. gotta see what the team looks like. I'll be there. I'll be at the game. Y'all know I'm Nick. Nick to my soul. He don't wanna play the five feel good about the trade. No, I don't feel good about the trade. I don't. You said Kat Don't wanna and I think Minnesota's gonna do well. Minnesota gonna too. I think both sides win this game. I mean win this trade on a basketball side of things. On paper. Yeah, on Paper. I think both sides do better. But damn. Oh it just hurts. It hurts. It hurts. The Heart of the team is Tibs. That's Where it starts me. It's the style of play.

(1h 19m 7s):
I think Kat is gonna be so pivotal for Brunson. Whereas I think Brunson and Randall, they both needed the ball to be successful. They both pound the air out the ball. So you can't have Randall doing what he doing. Aaron Brunson being in the game. I think Kat playing the Wing. He's a monster. He pr might be one of the best big men shooters in the league, if not the best. The best. Probably the best. Yo bro. That that just makes shit a layup. No pun intended for I knew, I knew there was Brunson. I knew there was trouble in the water when Nick, when Julius didn't sign his extension, when he tweeted, yo, the truth will be revealed. The truth will be revealed soon. When I did Jeff t Podcast, that was the the five 20 podcast that was, and they told me to name the starting lineup.

(1h 19m 51s):
I was like, Oh, Shit. We got starting lineup issues now with OG getting the big contract. Julius is not gonna play the three and Bridges ain't a two. There you go. And Bridges play way more deep. So Bridges is at the three way more deep. OG is at the four and you're not extending the guy. I think Julius gets all the credit in the world for coming here when nobody would come here. He had his two all NBA seasons here. He made This shit look fun. He made it attractive. He was a bad shot maker As much as we were frustrated he rose us to Yeah. Was the started. He was the start. He was the start of us getting the playoffs and, and I can't wait. I can't wait for that Minnesota game. So I could stand up and salute Julius Randall and Dante for what they did.

(1h 20m 34s):
For what they did. Yeah. Like I feel so passionate about it. If we won a ring, I would give them a A ring and And I'm down to go bet A A at least 20 that we get to the final 20. What Tony, Don told me that y'all get to the NBA finals. Yeah. You serious. You gotta do it. Yeah, you gotta do it. You gotta do it. Yeah. I Got a good shot. You gotta do it. Yeah. I got a good shot. I think y'all do. When I started looking at the east and and what they've done, shit Phil and Boston is, well Phil still there. I like, I like, I like and Milwaukee. I like the next chances before this trade. And barring health, I'm confident in what they'll do in court.

(1h 21m 14s):
Chris, See how it's gonna look. That's my go to. That's it. I it I go to health. I I'm trusting. I'm trusting in Leon who hasn't done wrong since he got here. He need to get executive of the decade for the job that he's done turning his team around. Yeah. I'm gonna trust that he's seen something and knows what he's doing. That's it. But. yeah. I would easily go bet that 20 on the Knicks at least to the conference final. At least to the conference final. That seemed like an easy bet to make. ESPN got him for 45 wins. It seemed like a easy bet that that's a over but whatever. Gotta see what happens with other teams injury wise. Philly gonna have a problem. Some, someone on there is not playing injury. Yeah. Not playing full Season. I hear the vagina drying up out there. I know I can hear it boy. It should sound like a The fucking duster busting.

(1h 21m 57s):
Yeah It is, It is drying. I'll do it. We dropped early last week so we didn't really get to discuss music. I'm only here to tell you that the Leon Thomas album is fire Is amazing. I want to say a cult classic. I don't even know who the cult is. No it ain't. I got ears. I'm gifted in that manner. I can listen to things. This album is fire. He went absolutely bonkers on this project and it For Me. It feels different. Like a different, the cover, it looks different. Like he got a dog on there and some masochists. What's the she dominatrix shit with the dog?

You know I absolutely Love it with the MUTT I am and have been. Huh? Where a nigga just getting his shit off? No, he's, he's To shorty Op. Where's my phone? Go ahead. Talk to these niggas. No, I I, it was funny 'cause I, I've been seeing him around circulating through the industry. That's hate. No, no not but I never took the time to actually listen to the music. I knew he was a talented guy so when this came across I said lemme listen. And I was amazed. Like I felt like I was behind on finding out about a dope artist.

(1h 23m 22s):
'cause then when I went and listened to this, I went and listen back. Listened back to some other projects he did. And those were fire too. So yeah. Salute to Him. I know Leon, Leon Thomas to be more of a traditional r and b act and his albums give me that, this album. It sound like he went and got some hip hop shit and had enough of this chick.

No because the Chick You want Back is the chick Emotional is the chick that you had enough of The Emotional shit go dance for some demons. Hello.

I feel like Lucky has been one of those people and then maybe a few other people outside it, but feel good today to have some male RB niggas kicking the ass. Sure. Speaking of Lucky Day, has anybody here heard that new Mario record? Yes. Yes. I Haven't. I haven't But I Got it here. You Got it. I found It before you play it. I mean, do we have credits on this? Did Dal do this? No, lemme Take Look. This is James fte. Laroy is the writer and I forgot the producer's name but it's not Diox B. Yeah. Alright. It's Fon Laroy. So we gotta treat this with some respect. And it's Mario so we gotta treat it for Hundred percent. Yeah. But when I saw Amani in the hookah spot, one of the first things I said was the New Mario record is giving me Lucky Day vibes And a little, a tiny bit Bruno vibes as well.

(1h 29m 26s):
Which is also Lucky Day Vibes because he My house. Okay. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. And I guess a lot of fans said the same thing because He responded to that because He responded. I want to find the response before I played the record. Just outta respect for who? Mario B. 'cause he didn't seem very happy with the comp. He sounds great on it no matter what. But yeah, I wasn't happy. Oh Of course. I can't find This shit. Go ahead and play the song. Alright, It's good to see you again. I see you in a My bad beat.

(1h 30m 29s):
Hey Beat is funky. I know This ain't bad. The people didn't say it was bad. They just made it comparisons. This Ain't bad. What'd you say?

(1h 31m 9s):
This ain't bad. No, it's not bad. I think never Said it was bad. Oh, Okay. And it might be a fig, it might be unfair to get that comparison. 'cause a lot of what D Miles and and Lucky does could be attributed to James Harland Roy. So if this is just James giving Mario his style, this is just Mario. Just giving, getting that from James doesn't mean that he had to take that from D Miles on Lucky Day. Like it seems, it seems like sonically they're all passing down each other the same kind of sonics in some some ways Kind of have the songwriters. Yeah, I was gonna say like maybe this is like just a moving trend in terms of the sound and just artists are jumping on it. Well James fine Laro is him and if he him submitted the song then he liked it.

(1h 31m 50s):
You're gonna Record. Huh? It's gonna, yeah. Yeah. I'm not mad at this. Ah, I'm gonna offer some pushback to that one. Go ahead. As big Mel said earlier, I could steal your shit if I'm more popping. That's True too. So even if that's James Fon Leroy's sound, James Fon Laroy is a writer behind the scene that the casual fan has no idea about his genius, his pen, his style. That's True. Okay. Lucky Day and Label and team are effectively branding that sound, this sound as theirs. So even if it's not, They may be, but that's unfair 'cause that sound has been around for a minute In recent r and b.

(1h 32m 33s):
Who has done it? Frank Ocean. Justin Timberlake. Is that a joke I just said in recent RB and you said Franko Tus Tus. That's what I'm saying. You're right. I Mean Frank could come out right now and say, all you niggas is my sons. Yeah. Yes. And then I guess that gives more credence to Father saying all the, you niggas are my sons. Yeah. My grandkids Currently mainstream. If you're a mainstream r and b act, Mario and his team have to know that there's gonna be some people to say, this sounds like Lucky Day. Very successful album. That algorithm album toward it. I changed my look, I changed my haircut.

(1h 33m 13s):
The video Even the Mario video Kind of. Yeah. Looks a little like Edgy. Hey For And Mario's my man, I I, I don't, I don't have nothing bad to say about Mario, but not at all. You just gotta be aware of this stuff for All we know. He could look at it and say, yeah, I see you. You got a sound that's popping. And I think I could do it better. That's Wrong. Because I'm married some Because I'm Mario. Yeah, That's wrong. Why is that wrong though? Shouldn't Do that. That's wrong. That's A good point. Ice. Why is that wrong? If I, if I truly in my heart believe I'm a better artist than you and you, you, I don't wanna call it pioneering, but you have a sound that no one else is really doing right now. And I say, oh, that's what they want. I know I could do that better than That. You sound like him doing her.

(1h 33m 55s):
I also feel like in the world of music where You're Purchasing beats and especially songs, it's like collecting art pieces. Like oh I want a font Leroy. You know what I'm saying? I don't care what y'all think about this, Leroy, but when you, you're cooking, when you're cop in a font LeRoi that the rest of the world doesn't know is a font laroy and they see it as a lucky day and then you're not copping a font Leroy. But that's not why you collect art. That's not true. You don't, you don't want the world to know it's a font laroy till they come in and be like, yo, what the fuck Is that? Yeah. But not even that. That's not why true collectors collect anything for everybody else's understanding. They collect it because they know the value. They have assigned the value to that piece of art and they want it for themselves.

(1h 34m 35s):
And then if every everybody figures it out, then they do. But that's not the reason that people cop Art Dog Mario For Me, his entire career has been, when he puts a lead single out, people are chasing his sound. And that's from that, that's from, I wanna know your name man. I wanna know man, shit. When fucking Neo first single dropped niggas was like, eh, give him a little Mario Not knowing that. He Not knowing. He wrote. Yeah. That's just what One Of Mario's biggest Song Me the fucking the the slow shit Love it Love it Love it Joint. I hated that song. Would You want to break? They've always kind of chased him. I've never heard of Marios Single and said, oh that's Mario saying like such.

(1h 35m 15s):
And so I've always said it the other way around, But Joe, if he's playing the game and the game Even with the Nicky shit. So I never thought don Don play with Mario. How long ago was that though? A little While ago. So If you playing the algorithm game now and you want to get on these playlists and you want to get circulated within that group, I'm, and that's the sound that's rocking. You might just start doing That sound. I'm not mad at that. But just know that you jacking a nigga who is a top Billboard act who is a lot of money behind the single and that sound went around the world. When it come back, they're gonna say, that's homeboy sound. I wanna Slow down on the jacking. And that's homeboy sound because with how close this is to Lucky Day's project, there's a very good chance that he had this record too.

(1h 35m 59s):
That's true. And was just waiting for him to get out the way That is true Possible. Likely. Possibly. I'm only saying you have to deal with the popularity of an artist. Cool. Yeah. I think from, and I'm, I'm gonna say this because of something Mario said himself on Instagram where somebody pointed out that they think he's jacking Lucky's vibe and he said, yes, I seen him live 60% good vocals, 40% autotune. Don't hate the truth, but Mario give you raw vocals every time. And I'm a fan and I to, to me Mario About that. Hold on. That nigga. Mario is cocky bro. He don't play. So now if I see you doing this and it's working and I'm like, oh first off, that lane ain't crowded.

(1h 36m 40s):
And if I get in that lane knowing who I am and what I could do, yeah. Move over. Hey guess what? I'm jumping over there. I love All that. But nah, that's not the way, ain't It? That's not the way. And he should he listen, Mario shouldn't be able to say whatever 'cause he vocally is that Nigga. If Mario make the better song, then Lucky Day has the better song just because of the money and the marketing that goes buying it. Nobody, it's not an artistry thing. Once you get into the song and selling the song and Mario always try to lean on that. Yo, I sing better than the field. Hey you do. But now when you walk in the studio and it's time to make a song that, and That is inclusive of all the people that can't really sing True, but some nigga song. But some niggas, that's what matter to them. Yeah. For the, for the real music fans.

(1h 37m 21s):
Yeah. I don't nobody give a fuck about the market. And we care about the song and how we sit up here all day and say, I don't care what this person sold and what that person sold. Exactly. This was a better rapper. That's a better song there. Social people can feel the same way. I'm buying any Mario project that comes out no matter how it sounds. This sounds great to me. 'cause he's on that list to me. He's with my Lloyd, he's with my people that's gonna produce a quality project no matter what. I'm just saying it shouldn't have been a shock to him when people came Back. Oh, That's that's all. That's all. That's all all I'm saying. He has the right and the L longevity and the artistry to do whatever the fuck he wanna do. Lucky Hasn't existed in this brand of RB long enough For Me to get on. This is his style. Yeah, no. And everything is, you know what I'm saying, we just speaking to the, to the moment.

(1h 38m 4s):
Yeah. And I do know Mario and Neo are going on tour with Mary J. So Mario, Mario says, I've been making my, I've been making my real music since I was 14. LOL. You have no idea what my unreleased music sounds like. Even my first album, niggas wasn't making songs like Braid My Head with harps Dreamy Strings and eight oh eights. Yeah, I agree. I just said that. Listen to Dancing Shadows. See I don't think many people heard that but me. Lucky is dope. But not only can and do I make real music, I make music sonically that explores different sounds of r and b and effort in an effortless, in an effortlessly manner. But I get what your ear has been currently accustomed to.

(1h 38m 43s):
See that's what I'm saying. I appreciate your support Thank. you just had to remind you what It is. That's what I'm saying. Alright. It sounds like he knows that. Yeah, He knows. Got it.

(1h 54m 41s):
But Ice was talking about some technology though a lot of people don't even know about in their phones. A Couple people realize the, the satellite s os technology that comes in all of the latest iPhones. I think from maybe the 13 or 14 on, if you have zero coverage, no wifi, no cellular at all, you can connect to satellite to get messages out. So that's how they've been able to relay locations and get in touch with out, you know, loved ones outside. Let people know, come, come I'm over here, come get us basically. Oh okay. It's been real fucked up bro. It's Terrible. It is, well prayers are with everyone who are affected by this serious as hell.

It's in the mountain, it's in the mountains. It's not, it's real heat in the valley. It's not on the coast. It's, you don't expect it to happen. It is like when we see Texas or Florida when they get hit with snow and they don't know what to do because they've never prepared for this. It's one of these type of situations like It is, It is real bad. I don't think we prepared for that. No, I get it. I enough. Alright. If you are just now tuning in, fuck you.

(1h 56m 11s):
Before we leave music, I do want to say Ombre my girl. My girl Ombre snuck one out round August that I didn't hear about. But if, if we're on the topic of music to be intimate to this is that, if you're familiar with Ombre, probably my next pod sleeper comes from the Ombre project. And I love the name of the project. I think it's called I do This shit in my sleep. The EP Uhoh supposed To do name.

He got records addressing, you know, everything he's been through. Okay. Addressing the people that kind of, I guess left thought it was over buckle no more counted them out.

He addresses that. Like he really covered all bases on this project. I was thoroughly, thoroughly, thoroughly impressed. So I just want to DaBaby don't get enough props or credit for his bounce back. His fall down. I won't say fall off, but his fall down was just A little stumble. All lights on. All mike's on. Yeah. Everybody had something to say. It is been, mums the word since his bounce back.

Now let's see what you really made of. I seen an old clip, or not so old, but I saw a clip of, I wanna say Chloe Bailey talking about fans asking her why she's not performing more and she got into the breakdown of how much it cost to perform and how labels are not approving budgets for people to just perform like it's a process.

(2h 0m 34s):
I'm like, damn, It is a process with everything and these fans have no idea. They think you're just opting out of things. Speaking of performance real quick. I I got a chance to Usher. Oh, I mean we went from Chloe Bailey. I think that was Holly and her man. That's true. It was That. Sure that was Holly and her man at the Usher show. Was that was when Usher, usher old freaky ass Holly And DDG. Yeah. When Usher freaky ass pulled the motherfucking cherry out his pocket, We burn of All. I don don't even trust niggas that got cherries in they pockets. But at some point a conversation has to be had about the freaky RB niggas and the things that they use to stage to thinly veil Like watermelon and come on, leave the fruit alone.

(2h 1m 20s):
The fruit blindfolds And Usher. I love, I absolutely love Usher went to the show. He tried some of that shit with me. I let it rock but a hard dap.

You can't pull a cherry out of your pocket and dangle it over my girl's mouth in hopes that she bites up or tippy toes to put it in our mouth while I'm standing right there while I'm next to her and I bought these tickets to your show.

No, no Usher. What else do I have here? Kamala dresses her identity. She went on all the smoke. All the smoke with Matt Barnes and Steven Jackson. Shout to them and she addressed her identity.

I know we beat that to a pulp, but it's, but boy was I sad when the two vans separated at the end and they had to go to different jail. Mm. That's why I don't do crime. You might split me up from the nigga I love. You might put me in a whole different jail from the person I was thorough enough with to do a crime.

(2h 13m 4s):
Then I gotta think of all my new crimes alone. That nigga might got a better knuckle game than me. You gonna take the muscle, you keeping him up. Mind fuck could you doing well one of them was just gonna suck some dick or whatever. Jelly wouldn't. He has one way to keep him off your, how's your Felicia? Hey, get your head game right.

Father Played with the boys' Butt. I, I believe so. I don't think it's coincidence that the member of the Menudo band comes out and says he had those experiences with homeboy and Ricky Martin has always been very vocal about the fact that in his younger performing years that he was molested and sexually assaulted. But never said who. Yeah, He did. He did. Did they find him? Huh? Did they catch the guy? Well that's, it's an allude.

(2h 16m 29s):

Moving on, moving on. We Ever getting It is over. Let me see. Leon Thomas hit Dad. Kamala, nobody had anything to say about that porch strike.

(2h 18m 37s):
Cool. MUTT, here we go. You know what, we haven't really spoke about the cold releases in in recent. That's True. Yeah. In recent months it's Only been a couple But. yeah. The daylight release I touched on you played it sleepers disrespectful to Dreamville Nation. He just put one out with Tee Grizzley and he put one out with Tee Grizzley. So I wanted to ask y'all, how have y'all been receiving the new cold drops since all of the hootenanny Dope verses? I like The verses. I like the verses Since all the Kendrick stuff, But some of the like goat and the rap talking shit parts is like, you Don't believe them. It just don't hit the same no More. Yeah, it don't hit quite the same.

(2h 19m 17s):
It don't Hit like all of that because He tuck tail. You like that daylight verse? I did. Yeah. For Sure. The daylight verse was dope. I just like, like I agree with y'all. I don't want to hit none of that. And I think we said that that before all that all that lot talk. I just don't wanna hear it no more. Yeah, Y'all said that like in the beginning of all of this, that you know, the bravado isn't believable anymore. And once it's like the fairy tale's over, you know, the The, it's still believable. The bravado is believable. It's just, which how you say it, what you say it about. I think It's just even while again, everybody respects Cole for his decision. I understand all of that. But you had the chance to prove the shit you were saying. At what cost though? I no, I I get it.

(2h 19m 58s):
It just makes it now does Everyone respect his decision? I do. No, I do Does Everyone, Everyone. And I respect it more as time goes on. Everybody though. That's, That's, that's Cool. Way to keep yourself outta mess. I think J Cole's done an amazing job keeping himself outta mess. I think he got outta character a second. He did. And he had some behind the scenes phone calls and got right back in his bag. Didn't wanna risk a friendship over silly rap future and Salute being a man and coming out and actually just saying, yo dogs, I fucked up. Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm correcting this. That's, that's all man shit. And ain't that you don't see today? Amazing. And it ain't just his relationship, right? It is him and all his artists and his side of town and the friendships that we have with that whole side of town. Correct. Like everybody's friends.

(2h 20m 38s):
That's a man. That's amazing to share that. Hold on just clearing that up though because that shit could snowball into something. Doesn't matter. Unnecessary. All that shit you talking about doesn't matter. That sounds Sounds great. Yo, I had that same take and y'all was dissing This shit out that boy months ago. We still was gonna discipline. So I came in and said, yo, I think he did some adult shit and y'all was like, fuck outta here. Wasn't from the competitive side. We still don't wanna hit that shit. So why couldn't, so why couldn't be competitive and rapping right now? Because him and Kendrick don't, didn't have to take it to the personal spots. Didn't have to. Kendrick and Drake went to they rap Kenrick, Kendrick and Jake didn't have to take it to the personal spots either. Nobody has to take it personal. And I'm saying that Kendrick and j Cole could have just had a rap beef without the personal. Do you think the casual fan is thinking about any of This shit we talking about? No. Right.

(2h 21m 18s):
All the casual fan, they got their favorite and they care about To the door. Speak to that. Now when you put out these verses, but I'm not a casual fan about, now you're putting out these verses and you're saying these things in the verses that n niggas don't want to hear no more. Yeah. We gonna start looking at you funny again. Yeah. We don't want to hear you talking about The ca the casual fan don't wanna hear from Cole. Period. That's Not true. I'm Right now they don't, that's not true. Unfortunately. No, the ca I'm talking about the same casual fan. They don't wanna hear it. They're writing them off. I don't agree with that. My thing with Cole is there's no more rapping he could do to let me know that he's a brilliant rapper. He's amazing. I've seen him rap the best with all of these different people. It's like he's kind of taken some of the luster off of the phenomenal rapping bag.

(2h 22m 3s):
Like what else do you have for us now outside of Shining with daylight, shining with Tee Grizzley, anywhere that he raps, he's gonna sound like one of the best rappers in the world. But At this Point, what else are you doing to get people to invest at this? And when I say people, I mean fans, the casual fans, the people that you turned away with that apology. It's tough to compete with your friend and not say something personal like that's why Kendrick is so ill to me. Because the this display he just put on is just the college version of what he did on the Big Sean record. There's another time in his career when he was like, Hey all of these niggas, I wanna be better than all y'all. I just kept escalating. So the theme is consistent Cole's.

(2h 22m 44s):
BET freestyle. Yeah, The B. The BET freestyle. He says, He says record's A big, He says it all the time. The the BET freestyle and the Drake beef at all different sectors of her career, of his career at matches. Hey, I wanna kill y'all here. Hey, I want to kill, especially you here. Hey, I'm killing you here Cole. We don't, that second crop It is tough. And I mean he's first crop, but that crop of MCs from that time outside of Drake and Kendrick It is murky for right now. Nothing to me that he doesn't. It's Murky for everybody making music. Let me start there. But it's murkier for the people that are expected to sustain a certain level of dominance into oblivion.

(2h 23m 28s):
I'm gonna still listen to and support Cole's music. I just don't wanna necessarily hear the I'm better than all y'all rappers. Shit, I'm the goat shit. I don't wanna hear the features that the battle rap. I don't wanna hear the features. I don't wanna Hear battle rappy Shit. I'm, I want to hear a project. I'm, that's what I wanna listen to at this point to see what you gonna flush out in that. It You don coming. I Love his features. He'd be smoking The, I mean he's gonna always Smoke a feature. I don't want to hear the other dude with Cole. I'm sick about, I'm good. I wanna hear Cole. I want hear you tell me about everything At this point. Cole, you've done the feature. And before when he put his board up, he had features, he had it crossed off. Like that was a bucket list thing for him. I've done the features with everybody, so I'm taking it as, okay, you, you proved that now you're back in feature bag, whatever. At this point we just wanna hear to fall off Like now let's hear that album that you've been teasing and and and rolling out for some time now.

(2h 24m 12s):
Yeah. Let's hear where you are with that and see what you do after that. But we don't, I don't, I personally, I don't need any more cold features. You've done it with everybody. You've done it in every, the whole spectrum of rap. You know what's funny? You've done this beat that beat this beat this type of record, that type of record you wrapped over there with Bill on a London record with a London accent. Like you've done it all from a feature standpoint outta Outta these three people. I feel like his next project the less pressure is The One the, I think the less pressure Lee. Oh yeah. To where he can really just go and create some fire shit and not have to exist. Kendrick has its expectation that people putting on him now. Drake, people watching Cole can just get in there, make a fire project and then we forget about all the other shit. Lau Hills already clapped back.

(2h 24m 54s):
What'd she say? A series of Instagram slides. Damn that was on time. Black. Black background. White font. She said that it's a baseless lawsuit. It was basically her tour.

But if it was my tour and you are on as a nigga Oh Shit and I had you on as a pity, I don't owe you shit situation. You could have me on for whatever reason. We have a contract for this and you fucked it up and that's not true. That's not, you might have a contract with me and I might have a contract with the venue. That's what I'm saying.

(2h 34m 8s):
The hell is this nigga in Part of the Show rambling on about, Let's hear it. Yeah, Let's hear it. I might skip him. He might be going too crazy. Lemme see. Need somebody. We need some important conversation for Mel. Dear Joe. That sound like you attacking me and Mel. I so no, and this is long. Nope. Skipping you. Fuck it. I'll read this one. This is from Dev with Troy. Oh. She must have got court cheating before a boyfriend made up. Put his name in This shit. That's right. Hey, tell him who you with. Go ahead Troy. So this is a woman. Shout Out to Troy. I don't know, I'm talking shit. Okay. In the brown-eyed bandit, two hour mark, Melyssa went hard about the hawk to a girl and warrant to be careful how you introduced yourself to the world because they'll never let you forget it.

(2h 34m 55s):
My homegirl is making good money on her personal site and OnlyFans, she has aspirations to do other things, but she's stuck in the middle of survival and her dreams. Recently an opportunity for a brand deal came about, but died after they discovered her core revenue stream. I hate when that happens. This reminds me of partners that got caught up in the middle of trying to transition outta the dope game. So my question is, if it's people that will never let us forget our past, or is it that we won't move on and do what's necessary to fully move past it ourselves? Parentheses, don't flip me and air this part. Oh, this was inspired by, well nigga, if I can't say that.

(2h 35m 40s):
Well what's this question? I don't understand the question now I'm airing you out. Yeah. Fuck's talking about this was inspired by Melyssa because I think she has aspirations to do new things. Diversify, based off what I've heard her say and seems to feel held back a bit. I was in a meeting and wanted her for a list of people to bring out to a high profile event at Harvard on mental health. I'm not tripping off of it, but when the IG le Le Oh, okay. I won't air the rest of that. Oh, I see what you're saying. But this is about me. Well, only in the parentheses part that I wasn't supposed to read that we got you yet. He was, he was trying to pitch you to Harvard, but click the link tree.

(2h 36m 21s):
Seen some shit up in there. It is like, I can't present her. Oh, that's awesome. You should erase your shit. Huh? You should erased that. Okay. That's a whole other fucking conversation. Is that hate? Yeah. No, it, I wouldn't necessarily say that it's hate, but like you can't in this day. I know you can't tell a girl No, no, exactly. In this day and age in 2024, you cannot tell a fucking, I know that everybody's trying to tell women what to do with their fucking bodies, but don't fucking tell me what the fuck to do with my body and my image and shit like that. I didn't Mean it if I was going, No, no, no, I'm not even, I'm not even addressing you. And this is no smoke to, and he didn't. This is no smoke to this individual and Thank you for even thinking of me because regardless of, you know, me being in a music video or me having only fans or whatever the fuck, I still am a hardcore advocate for mental health simply because of my personal experiences that I've been very candid about.

(2h 37m 11s):
So if Harvard didn't want me, let me be diplomatic in what I say. Then That is the choice that they made. That is the choice that they made, but I'm sorry that they made it because I would've made an excellent panelist because this is what I do. I am an, I am a natural storyteller and order and people feel connected to me because of the fact that I'm candid about my stories and challenges with mental health. So you doing real Good at being diplomatic to that? Just one sec. Yeah. Are you being, are you shooting big ride? Are you shooting? No. Are you being so No. Okay. No, I want to say too, no, Mel is, clap it up for that. Yeah, that was, come on Thank, you come on.

(2h 37m 53s):
But, but that's true. Like it's just, you know, sometimes I think it's both things that they said in this. I think it's both getting stuck but also trying to elevate and also wear like a Yeah, you're Pigeonholed by your past. Yeah, you can be. But then also, I mean, there's so many stories of people who kind of like start in one way and then, you know, gradually over the course of years and sometimes decades you get recognized for something else. But I just was literally, you know, told some sidebar information about how somebody close to me regarded me as well. She's still, she's just the video girl and I'm like, I could cure cancer tomorrow. And a lot of people are still just going to refer to me as the video girl.

(2h 38m 33s):
It doesn't matter that I have acted, it doesn't matter that I'm a television host. It doesn't matter that I'm, I'm, I'm a podcaster. It doesn't matter that I've found success in many gen, different genres of entertainment. It doesn't matter that the CDC, the Center for Disease Control has like hired me to be, you know, you know, just go out into the field and represent. It doesn't, none of that matters when people are committed to misunderstanding you or believing you to just be this one isolated thing about you. That's, I agree with that. That's just, that's it. It's, you know, it's, it's the way that our brains are set up. Yeah. Confirmation bias, a whole bunch of things. I feel you. So you can't, you can't really fight that. And that's why I was so passionate about the Hak Tua girl because I was like, we don't even know this girl's name and this is going to like, you know, follow her and stay with you pal.

(2h 39m 16s):
Exactly. And this might not be what she wants or even understands. So that's just why I was like really passionate about that in theory. And not necessarily just about her. 'cause I don't know her and I don't know what she aspire, what her aspirations are. So Yeah. Now that I've heard the hawk to a girl talk, she should stick with that Hawk tour thing. Probably ain't a range of topics that we should hear from. Anybody heard Angel Reese podcast? No. No. I haven't heard it has it You boys? No. You boys lie devils. You heard? You heard it.
