That's accurate. So We on two different sides of the fence. That's what So basically, basically be triggered. Yeah, I got triggered by you. That's what, okay, so you took out This shit on the all that's cool. That's peace. Okay. Tolerated goes back to, I wonder nigga, you get tolerated too. Old nigga.

(4m 47s):
Hit the hood the way it did. Yeah. All of these dumb ass words. But especially triggered. 'cause triggered used to be a thing like, okay, maybe this person is in therapy working on the triggers. And then all the therapist shows hit TV and in social media the girls got involved. Once they got off fashion over, they went over to fucking wherever they get the buzzwords from. It is bad now. So now people just saying triggered and they still fucked up. Like, okay, we fixing it or Nah, Nah. Or you just gonna tell people when they identify, when they say or trigger you. That's it. That's it. I think that is, we don't need the solution. I think that is the most toxic shits in the world.

But we The greens, we the greens You think we're the greens? You fucking right. We the greens. Okay. I Wish I knew. I'm telling you, we The greens. Yeah. I don't understand what they saying.

You figure listen, listen. You trying to figure Coach, I don't understand. You suck ass nigga. You that Illuminati shit. Where would you gentlemen, where, Where, where Would you gentlemen like to go from here? Well, I mean, we, we, we speaking on great friendships.

(52m 37s):
Yeah. Can we speak about some friendships going awry? Oh, let's do it. We, we, we have Ice Spice and Chloe, they going at it. Cleo Cle Cleo. Yeah. I don't know why the fuck I keep calling her Chloe Ice Spice and Cleo, I, this was my 5:00 AM to 7:00 AM this morning getting updated on Bright Early with the ice. Ice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because yesterday it was a holiday yesterday, so everybody was like full of love. It wasn't enough tea out there. So Ice Ice was kind of the only tea out there this morning. I let it All Rock. The Cleo girl had about seven parts each 10 minutes a piece. Oh yeah. And then Ice Spice was on spaces and said a whole bunch of shit. I'm, I'm gonna save y'all the trouble and not play any of it.

(53m 20s):
The, the basis of this argument is Ice Spice calls Cleo and says, Hey, I'm going on tour. We got an extra bus. So if you want to come on tour, come Cleo's version is Ice Spice says, come on tour. I got you. Cleo's a rapper. Yes. Cleo is an independent female. mc Got it. Her version is Ice Spice said, come on tour. I got you. That is not ice. Spices version of things. So the Cleo girl goes on tour with a day's notice, not really much prep time. And she's being treated like someone who is just a add-on for the tour that nobody really gives a fuck about.

(54m 5s):
But she don't kind of know that. So she's expecting for her bags to be taken care of. The same way that Ice spices bags are taken care of. Oh, she's expecting for ice, spices, security to kind of be put to work for her as well. And she's expressing this in her rent. She's like in her rent. She's like, I went in, I, oh, her sleeping arrangement. She had a problem with she, she, she was told she had to pay for her own room. So in her story, she's like, why would I agree to come on a tour that I have to pay for my own room? Y'all are staying at four and five star hotels. I'm an independent act. Why would y'all think I have this money?

(54m 45s):
Then they would be stopping to eat. Cleo would be like, they, they, they, yo, whatever they saying to Cleo, whatever you eat, you gotta pay for Opening act shit. Yeah. All This sounds like opening act shit. That's exactly what it sounds like. Yeah. But Cleo is responding like, this is my friend who's treating me, treating me this way. So Cleo's like, I don't want these feelings to build up inside of me. So I'm a step to her. So while Ice Spice is in the shower, Cleo goes in there to do her makeup. This is per her words. And she say something to Ice Spice, who's naked in the shower? Yo dog. Hey. About that tour. Yeah. About that bag. The security, yada yada, yada, yada yada.

(55m 26s):
In that convo, Cleo says that Ice Spice says security is paid a flat rate to only be by me. Cleo is like, I've seen your security. Leave your side mad times to handle your bags, dog. I'm trying to, I'm in the shower trying to wash my pussy mom. I'm trying to wash my pussy. That is sweaty and, and I get it. Cleo don't have a room. So she end up, she end up staying in the makeup artist's room and, and bonding with the makeup artist. But there was no communication between Ice fights and Cleo during this tour. And it's a 40 minute rant about that, give or take.

(56m 6s):
She's On the tour to perform. Correct? Yes. Opening up then what the fuck is the problem here? I think it's, the problem is you're my friend. I think it's, I think it's, the problem is I've never been on tour before. That's the, I've never been on tour and you're my friend. Yes. And you asked me to come on this tour a day before and you told me you got me. Yes. And then When I came out here. You didn't have me at all. And it kind of seemed like this is Cleo's words. It kind of seemed like you wanted me to struggle out here. Mm. Mean, I think it was a communication problem. I think that if Shorty's never been on tour, 'cause y'all saying it like, duh. Yeah, y'all been on tour, right? So she Didn't, Shorty's never been on tour and your friend is saying, yo, come on girl, we got extra room. I got you.

(56m 46s):
Now you staying in the Four Seasons I don don't have no, She said next. She said an extra bus. A Whole, yeah. I got you. I don't know what I got. When my nigga say I got you. Like if you be like, yo dog, come to the strip club, come to the club. And I'm like, yo, nah, I'm gonna just chill at home. I don't have no money. And your man says, yo, I got you. come on. That means nigga, eat what you want. Do what you want do. I got You. So that's the miscommunication. That's a miscommunication because she heard I got you. And Ice Spice is basically saying, I have an extra bus. Make it hot for yourself because this is an opportunity. That's the I got you. Yeah. That's the I got you. I got You. Is Because if I didn't, I'm gonna let you open up for me. This is, I Got you. Because other than that, what would you be doing? I look, you'd be home in Staten Island. Not, and, and that's the opportunity cost.

(57m 27s):
True. If that means you gotta walk the juniors to get your cheesecake True and do that. But don't look to me as the friend while I'm on the road. 'cause I agree with you about the miscommunication point, but the part that Cleo don't know is Ice. Ice ain't calling Nia shot on that tour. True. She don't have no say over nothing. And she sold. Sure. They don't know that she, she has not sold enough records to be in, in this position. And on tour every single dollar is accounted for. Yes. Months before we went on tour. Yep. I know exactly how much all of these rooms are gonna cost. I know exactly how much the gas is gonna cost. We can't afford another bus, but we got another bus. Okay, let's bring some other people.

(58m 8s):
But those people are for the free, there's no budget. These people gotta come and thug it out. we know where we're gonna shower at. we know how much the food costs and we can't go over it. We cannot go over it. It sounds like they should been a phone call to a manager or something. Absolutely. After the I Got you. And that's why I wanted to have this talk. 'cause It is a teachable moment for new acts out there. Right. In business. In business. Fuck it. I'm 44. I'm telling the truth now. I ain't even doing no lie. Yo. Most people out there are choosing opportunity cost over whatever friendship you think you got with people. I know it sounds bad. That sounded horrible. What you mean? I don't understand? You Got it elaborate.

(58m 49s):
Friendship comes second. The opportunity for the ceiling to be this high in my hopes and dreams comes first. Gotcha. Anybody or anything that impedes that you a detriment. And if you a artist and you don't feel like that you're surrounded Label has put people around you that's gonna remove that person. Yeah. That's It is going to go this way. Gotcha. So that's what I'm saying. Ice Spice as a friend. Dude, I, I feel like, and the Internet's dragging her right now. The internet is totally dragging her right now. But the internet, I don't really know too much about tours either. They don't. They don't. They don't. They don't have a clue. They don't. But based on what you said, shorty Didn't either. don don't think I spice even Thoughs.

(59m 30s):
I I know, I agree. And that's the what people are missing. This is her first time headlining a tour for herself for her own album. It is her first album. Correct? Right. I'm just saying. I'm Just saying. I'm just saying 44 years old. You think I know the ice ice disco. My kids brother, that's my little brother. What's For us to know? But end of the day, this is her first go at a actual tour of her own headlining in her own joint. She is not the pinpoint person for everything going on on that tour. True. She's Probably not even a little bit Yeah. She's being handed information and even in that moment of her having to really kind of focus on herself, she thought, let me give a light to my friend, to my homie. That to me is enough.

(1h 0m 10s):
That's the extent of what she can do. That's, that's All I need to She can't do nothing else from that. Yeah, but her but her friend. But She can't even tell the security to go and yo bring her bag too. She can't do that. Yeah. The person that's paying for her security is putting that person on. This person. The one making the fucking wheels go round around. No, she can't go get your bag. Oh. She was mad that her bag got left when all the ice spices, 10 bags was right there. And she's like, well how could you, how why would you leave that one bag there? Because that's the gig. Yeah. That is the gig we done left niggas and they bags when they ain't come down on time. Yes. On the tour. Yes. And make it to the next city.

(1h 0m 50s):
Who Uber to the bus. Hey, catch up on the highway to the bus. Yeah. It get rugged out there. Dude. Super. I remember like eight niggas staying in the, in the double bed nigga in one room nigga. Yeah. Like on tour. Like that's what she's talking about is nothing clean. A step further. I I I remember going on tour and opening up. Right. Never got paid to open up. Nothing like that. My duty was, I'm going to try to facilitate in another way to be able to make this make sense. True. So So I could also take advantage of this opportunity. But that's something that I had to know on my own. I couldn't wait for Joe or or anybody to say, yo, this is what you should do. 'cause they got their own shit. They're thinking about they got their own parts of the tour that they gotta focus on that they not really thinking is nothing but Moving parts complicated.

(1h 1m 31s):
Moving parts that are have to be on time and timely. Yo, we gonna get back for what they did to the Cold Cross too. We get back for what they did to the cold fuck up. No, but for real, like I listened to that and I felt, I felt, I felt bad for both of 'em because I know shorty really doesn't know. They Both young, they both been experienced I. don think It's, and they both don't know communication. They just Don know Her. Her level of expectation and entitlement is through the roof. Like mentioning I don't think so. No, no, no, no. The simple fact that she's mentioning, well you're staying in four and five star hotels, she's Ice Spice you. No, she's saying you're staying in four and five star hotels and you told me, come on, I Got you. Again. Back to the misunderstanding. 'cause I spice thinks she said something completely different.

(1h 2m 13s):
See I take that to mean, and this is me having been on tour, we are gonna find a space for you in one of these rooms. Right. Cool. That's what I know about. That's it. Cool. Cleo was of the impression that she would have her own space or maybe be with Ice Spice. With Ice Spice. So there was a lot of nights where she was in the same room with Ice Spice. And I'll tell you as the, as the headliner bitch, get the fuck outta my bed. That friendship shit is out of the window. Yes, yes. I'm at work. Yes. I am a star and they putting zillions of dollars behind me. Move, move. And that sounds mean. Could I also add too, don don't know.

(1h 2m 53s):
She could have, she didn't have to. Let's just say she needs to raise the profile of the tour. Right. There's other people that You can put on that slot who are still independent that can add value to the tour instead of putting on your friend. It might pay for it by the way. And might pay for it. There's people that pay for slots on tours And follow behind the tour bus in their car. Yeah, I know. Yeah. Like I know people on tour now who sit and sleep in they car I don and go to the next spot just so they can have the Opportunity to perform with someone. All are saying that as people that have been on tour and that know this business homegirl don't know the business evidently. So what she's saying is, my peoples told me, come on, I got you. And I'm going, I don't expect to starve on the tour.

(1h 3m 33s):
So my friend told me that she got Me this, this would be a learning opportunity for her. For both of them. Well for both of them. you know, which doesn't negate she, she shouldn't be ranting, she should be expressing this between her. I, I spice and maybe having a conversation with management to learn what was this teachable moment for me Not having a conversation with her management. But that's, but that's problem number one. And a lot of young acts out there need to hear this no matter what your friend is telling you, once business is involved, get your business people involved. Yes. When I, spike says y'all, I want you to come with me on tour. Take that back to your independent crew. Yeah. Present that and now let them call ice spices people to work out what the parameters are about to be.

(1h 4m 15s):
That's correct. You can't just blindly Yeah. She might not have that old action. She might not Not have. There's old action Learn then guess what then it's not time to tour. Ice Is Ice Spice is her people. If you Don't have that, then it's not time to tour. That's right. Cool. I I see I'm looking at it differently. Explain. I'm looking at it And I gotta be ick soon. But still. Nah, I'm, I'm saying if Joe called me and said, yo, we going on tour over here. Uhuh, come on. I got you bro. Again, I don't know the ins and outs and the inner workings of the music business. Yeah. But I do know it's friendship. I know the block. I know when my man say I got you. That is me. Yeah. This is no longer that. This is my point. And I don't know that stuff.

(1h 4m 55s):
The problem in your example is I don't hear where you're an artist. I know what I'm saying. If I was you Have, you have to be an artist. Oh no. I'm saying if I was, if I was an artist and I was indie and you popped and you said, yo, come on, I got you. Because you looking at Ice Spice like yo, you just was in a fucking thing with Taylor Swift. Like you up up shorty might not know that Ice Spice is not in control. Shorty might not know that Ice Spice don't have say in what the security does or who bags they get. It's just a miscommunication thing I think. And the thing Of not knowing it's ICE's job to communicate these things to a artist. Once business is involved on page three of the the pamphlet, it says hire a manager When, you have things to manage.

(1h 5m 38s):
Yeah. Until that happens, you are the manager By the way. Until that happens now you, It is just you and if you want just you and iPic is where she is. Taylor Swift, super Bowl, the label putting money is slap after slap and and you not ready for that level of exposure. You only gonna hurt yourself by doing it. I told my son, I tell young artists, yo. That's right. Yo don't it. There's value in staying in your lane. There's value in nobody knowing You if you not all the way ready. That's right. Because once the world knows you, it, you can't put the toothpaste back in the thing They know you now. So be ready don. Don't think the young lady and don don't know enough about her so I'm open to being wrong.

(1h 6m 18s):
No, she but no, that sounds right. I gotta move on. If there's not a team, you not ready to go city to city and get your, you not even gonna know how to capitalize off this bro. There's A disconnect. I I know we got a hundred dollars to her name. I know. We gotta move on. Oh yeah. She said she didn't have no money. She had to spend 700 outta her own account. It's like, no, you not prepared for this level yet. Give it a year. Your home girl is rocking. Let your home girl go get hot. Exactly. Let your home girl go do it. Get with her next year. Joe. There's a disconnect though. The disconnect is if this girl is really that close to ice, ice, I'm pretty sure at some point she's traveled with Ice Ice independent of a tour or something like that. Like that. Whether it be going to, we Might have went to Mexico. So we went, we went Somewhere and, and that treatment, you've given me that level of treatment.

(1h 7m 0s):
So now I'm But That was so personal though. But but for people who don't know the business in that sense, you don't disconnect. 'cause if you say come let's do it. You just thinking we all doing under the same lives. Yeah. I think that was 1988 EPMD business. Never personal, changed life. Yeah. Might have been 89. You can speak business, never personal. What I, what I do when we go to Mexico or to fucking wherever we go, what I do on personal time, I'll just do it. If I'm a new act there. This new act, grace New Acts can't do shit. Were you, So when We on label time, you are on label time. That's, It's it, it all, it's not doing civil sentence.

(1h 7m 42s):
Hey, who could I speak to to out the details Period. That's it. Period. That's it. That should be something that you always handle when it comes to doing business With friends. It's a bad case of bad communication and friendly's and friendly entitlement. When, you When, you were promoting Focus, right? You was on the Envy tour. Did you experience anything like that Joe? Or you just was like the tour that you was on promoting Focus was the Envy joint. Right. Hustling. Hustling. Every day. I'm hustling every day. I'm hustling. We hustling. We hustling. That's what I, there's no time for entitlement or luxury items or premium things. When, you are in the early stages of a career with no record and nobody knows you. You gotta do everything you gotta do.

(1h 8m 22s):
They in a new age today where they want certain things handed to them. But that was Envy's tour. Envy's tour that they got envy a deal at another building. And somehow I was able to jump on that tour 'cause I licensed a record over here. Nobody knows me. They don't know what I look like. Sound like nothing. Then they didn't give a fuck about a focus. But the label was doing what they supposed to do. Hey, you run around with envy on this. It was a van, it was low. It was tight in there. We were stopping. It was the same sweats every day as the grind. We was having egg fights at the Stop Bow Nigga. It's the fun shit When. you stop at the store, get your shit nigga throw a sandwich at you Bow.

(1h 9m 5s):

I'm saying her accommodations don't say say broke. That's a label. I know They believe in her. I know. So from the other. And they gonna get their money. They gonna put 19 projects out. They gonna make you get a the label Future Future with fucking Sam Smith bro. Mar Somebody But. yeah. Ice Spice don't have it today.

Oh it was a, it was a scene in there last night. People watching. But anyway, it was a table, a few tables down full of like young, young, young, young, young, young kids. Like niggas that looked 15 and 16, but they looked like they was athletes. Had some height on them. It's like, you know what I mean? It's like, take your watch off just in case you got a snuff one. These dude, I know, I know, I know that feeling. And then one of them got up, the tallest one got up from the table with the shortest one in a hoodie. I normally know the shortest one in the crew to be the shooter. You gotta watch 'em And they don't search niggas and catch. I realized that last night.

(1h 28m 11s):

Ignoring that. I do wanna get back into album reviews at some point. Yes. I don't know if we have to do that right now. No. This Cardi, this Cardi Maternity pick.

(1h 29m 31s):
This is a quick story for me. Yeah. I don't believe that she did that. don don't believe that she intentionally did that. That's what I got for you. I'm not expounding. If y'all want to please be my guest. She done lit me up last month. I'm 44 now. I'm trying to be mature. What can, what did the graffiti behind her actually Say? You're being messy. I know I'm not. I'm trying to make us Say it said something. But then someone wrote over the top pedophile. Ah, like af post. Yeah. It was like a, a nice tag on the wall and then someone went over the top of it and wrote pedophile. It was like a shitty one. Is This picture on her Instagram? She might have deleted it by now. She swapped it out. She deleted it. She swapped it out. It is gone. But when the pic hit, they were accusing her trying to be shady.

(1h 30m 12s):
She responded saying, y'all stupid as hell. If y'all think that I'm trying to use my maternity shoot to be this shady, I would, we really were just rushing to find a spot because blogs were trying to leak my business before I was ready. So we was trying to rush and get it out there. I didn't see that. Nobody I was with saw that we swapped it out immediately. I don't have no problem getting shit shaken, but I'm not using my child to, to my I believe and I believe, I believe that. I believe that. I believe that same. I believe it. I believe that. I'm not that foul to not do don don't think nobody's doing it. It Is wild for the photographer. Whoever's doing art direction or whatever today pick up On, it wasn't even art direction. It was literally like her friend. She said it, her friend was taking a picture with a fucking iPhone. Like they just found a a a random street and she posed up and that was it.

(1h 30m 55s):
So they didn't take stock of what was happening on the walls and shit. It was that random for her. you know. That's What nice fool picture. Well, I mean, you know, it's probably the 15 prom doesn't That was an iPhone picture. Yeah. I mean you could do a lot of shit and post, but yes, that was what she said. Caught you snitch. Snitched on yourself. How You can edit in that body. I did. I wish I mother fucking would. You can doing a Lot I don have to doing a lot in that post. I don't have to. Well stay tuning it up. No, never Doing some editing. No. So. I. you know I've heard, oh, I've seen there are apps for that that I don't use. Shout You be Filtering off. They're, they are not on my phone. You, You do the snap filtered in the IG filter.

(1h 31m 36s):
Do you swipe, swipe flex twice? Just the face filter Swipe le What's, what's left twice? What's That? What's the Paris or what whatever that that filter. Valencia. Yeah, that's, you know the number of the filter in my nigga Yo, because somebody told me to put it on the other day two times. Yeah, because there's a filter that make the ugly chicks pretty. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. They give 'em good skin. Remove they pores. You gotta be, it's a Snapchat. Look cartoons. But. yeah, you gotta know about, about that man. Paris Just said It is Paris. I just said Paris. Yeah. Yeah. We j won. Yo, you Funny. It is nothing you diminish in society, man. Yeah. Let's see. All right, so we're done with that Cardi topic. Da the billboard 200 delayed.

(1h 32m 17s):
Yes. Yeah, We can do it. We can do It. don don't know anything about that. Okay, so we talked about a little bit with Travis doing two 17 or whatever the number was And now his numbers are in, he did 360 1. Woo. Shit. Oh. Shit. Oh my God. Alright, well he's number one. He was, he was doing That is Bri Carpenter. Sabrina Carpenter did 360 2 Oh. Wow. He lost by a thousand Oh. Wow. Damn. Put so much back. But they delayed it for like a week and a half. Figure out some respect On that boy name. I've never seen that in my entire life. I don't believe nothing about these numbers. I Don't Either. I don't believe not one thing about these numbers about Hers or his, his Oh, oh, okay. I don. No, she's how she's she's She's lit. Yeah, She's fine. 'cause that's a new album. Yeah. This is not a new album. True.

(1h 32m 58s):
And you want me to believe that Travis Scott sold 361,000 copies of an album. That's not new, But this is the first time that album has been available. So, I actually kind of believe it. Like he's got a big fan base and that album came out in what, 2012 or some shit like that. So they're probably not even aware of it that they don't even know what a dap Piff is. His new album didn't sell this, But this is a classic album. Okay. But his audience should have only grown since then. And his new album didn't touch this but that slaps. But if his classic songs that you couldn't get anywhere else, correct. Then I'm gonna go buy it. Yeah. Awesome. I do not believe that that's happening in the state of the current industry.

(1h 33m 39s):
So you think that what? Somebody inflated these numbers? I don't know because it's above my pay grade. I think that some tech companies somewhere is doing something behind the scenes. Just like the company, just like the labels. Travis Scott was the baby for the bundle packaging of the labels. He was So Travis Scott gets special privileges to, to certain tricks. Tricks Of the trade. He is doing like a, a merch vinyl situation. So that probably plays into it too. I believe these numbers. Yeah. I. don, don Don't bother I. don I Don't I don I. don, I don't feel like a Call me a hater. I'm sorry. Listen, congratulations to Travis. Yeah, great feat either way. Fuck my skepticism, right?

(1h 34m 20s):
But? yeah, I'm skeptic. That's all. That's all. But shout to Travis, his entire team. Go ahead. I've just never seen it get delayed like this. Travis is signed to. Wait, let me do some now that's about all up. Now hold up now I'm, I'll put this together right now. Is Travis Rock Nation That I don't know. I don't believe so. No. Yeah, I don't think So. Do he be at the brunches? He Might be. What's the name of this new shit? Well the new shit is the old shit. Days before Rodeo. Yeah. And That is cactus check under exclusive license to Epic Records division of Sony. Hmm? What year that came out? 2014. 2014. It says. Yeah, 2014. I don't believe that 10 year anniversary. I believe this. I believe it.

(1h 34m 60s):
Project of that length of time before would garner that much. Listen, right now I do think people would go listen if a hundred, 200 maybe, but 3, 360 So I. Don't think So. This is a hundred too high. Yeah, I think it, This is a hundred too high. But Y'all said two 17 it wasn't going to be a real number I think. No, it wasn't two 17. It was higher than it. No, it was two 17 and y'all said they was projected two 17. It was something I thought. No, it was two 17. I I think I'm on. And y'all said that, that that was the computer's ping. But I don't, Two 17 is believable. Listen, and I'm not accusing anybody of anything. I'm just saying I do not believe these numbers. No sir. Re Bob, I believe us to be in a transitional stage in music consumption, triage and some people It is they're gonna pick six people to try shit out with and the rest of you will do 19 and 20 and 30,000.

(1h 35m 53s):
So you don't, but but he's one, He's one of the, he's one of the ones, he's One of the ones AAA list. He's one of the ones. He's one of them. He's one of the ones. No doubt about it. No doubt about, oh hey to look at toy. Yeah. No, he is one of the ones. So yeah, I'm not buying. But congratulations to all the people that put some money in the pocket behind this I. gotta I, gotta I, gotta get down to the bottom of my, that's a congratulations. Your sauce, man. Because you I think that shit you be saying, you got me over here. Like, what the fuck is going on? But I, I'm gonna get down to the bottom of It. Yo, we are in an entertainment business. Entertainment means nothing here is real. I Got it. I I understand That. Nothing, nothing is real. Everything is smoke and mirrors. Everything is happening behind, behind the front facing shit.

(1h 36m 35s):
Like, and maybe I'm, I'm fucking not jaded. That's maybe, yeah, I've, I've been, I don't expect you fans are not supposed to know any of this stuff. You're not supposed to like know the inner workings of shit. So, I. I'm fine with sounding like a complete nutcase in this. The labels want people to continue to think that I am a complete nutcase. 'cause I'm telling. But if the numbers are inflated, I'm not saying inflated. I'm saying the label Doesn't make the money. That Ain't true. So, I, I'm trying to figure out, don't you make, they make money off of each sale. Right? So if you inflate the numbers of sales streams, Let's take it off of music because that's gonna make it difficult for people to understand.

(1h 37m 20s):
Okay. As content creators and influencers, yes. Back when the rush happened and all of y'all went to buy followers, you did that because you could take those numbers, that's a fact and present them and now get money from the field. you right. It is no different in music. you right. If my number says I sold two, three and 400,000, it don't matter if that's real or streams or stream farms or bots, I can take that number and go take it to Google and take it to That makes sense. Samsung, whoever, Partnerships, sponsorship. Yeah. And that, and that's only happening for the creme de la creme for the top of the top for the premier acts around here.

(1h 38m 0s):
Which Travis is Yes. And does it matter if those numbers are like fudged or falsified? Because, because when it, with the example of using follow bought followers from Instagram, eventually people started to catch on that the number didn't equal the engagement. And so let's just say you have a million followers, but underneath the post you got 867 likes. Comments. I might Have already Cocked 1.2, $1.3 million. But Even, but eventually the, the, the fucking jig is up. you know that's hard to The Jig. The jig is never up The music. It is the pon. Yeah. The jig is never up because it's a Ponzi scheme. So most of these bundle packages or whatever the new trick is, I don't know it 'cause I'm ancient and retired.

(1h 38m 42s):
Whatever the new trick is, is approved by the label. It is a label. You have to Got it. It's a label bought trick. Everybody can't get this trick. Right. So now that ties into we are getting that approved with Billboard. We called Billboard. Hey Got it can we Billboard says yes. I'm not saying that labels have a hand in all of these places, but the Spotifys and yeah, all of our tentacles are coming together to get this off. Which is why the average Joe Schmo, you would never, you would never, This is random. When, what did, when Jay-Z had that album with the phone, do you think all those numbers were drilled?

(1h 39m 27s):
None of those numbers were real. You talking about when he sold this album, sold directly to, to Samsung saying He sold a million, he sold a million records or however many records it was before the album was released. Released, yes. Because he was innovative and he went to he directly himself but acting as a business. Yes. Got it not an artist. He went to them, said, let's cut a deal in that deal. Y'all have to purchase this amount of albums. So he was gold or platinum. I think it was platinum. Platinum. Before the album ever dropped. Purchase the middle. Got it up. Got it. So they bought these albums already. Samsung more. We could give them away. I'm ho I can give this away now. Got it. And I wanted to ask, what did he, he changed the game. He changed the game. Alright, you Two.

(1h 40m 8s):
You two did changed the game too quick. I want to tell you about, listen, I know that the average consumer has no idea how much all of these little tricks cost and the percentages involved. But I have moon long here. Money, money long. Why do I always do that? I don. She's coming here soon. I don't know why I do that. I have money long here. To just give you a quick, quick idea. Typically for a 12 hour block, It is 1200 bucks and then the session engineer is 75 to 100 an hour. So just add that up. Say you do seven sessions a week, it's $10,000 just on sessions. And then mixing anywhere from 2,500 to 10,000 a track.

(1h 40m 51s):
That's 19 tracks. So that's a hundred thousand dollars. Just rounding it. Yeah. Your math is impeccable. Now you are already at 120 and now you gotta pay for the beats. So they're anywhere from 5,000 to 40,000 a track depending on who you are working with. Times 1914. So 400,000. So let's just say two 50 plus one 20. Now you are already at 300,000. That eliminates 75% of the people who are aspiring you. right. I didn't realize how much money that it takes to actually be an artist. This is before you market. This is before you shoot a video. This is before you do an appearance.

(1h 41m 31s):
They tell you to invest In yourself, but it's also a bit scary Investing in yourself. Song Big Nadeska. Go ahead. Nadeska Is the most important thing. But there are so many other things that it takes to take that song and make it be worth something. There are. Yeah. That's dope. That's dope. I'm glad she did that. That's a really Good breakdown. you know none of This shit man. It's, But you know what happens though, business. But then you hear the fans listening to the quote unquote experts that say, yo do it yourself. Fuck the label. Right. you know what I'm saying? So it's, it's It is a 50 50 over here. Y'all saying fuck the label then somebody saying no, the label nigga is really makes you famous or really makes you profitable because pe so if you are a young 20-year-old nigga, that's fire.

(1h 42m 13s):
You don't know what route to take. It is mad, confusing. Figure it Out. People are so used to now at this point, anything that's entertaining as far as just content, social media, they just see it so quickly. They don't understand the process of what it takes. Short term TikTok shit. You can become famous off your little quick TikTok click that really took nothing to make. So they try to also apply that to artists. Well look how quick that's becoming popular. Why can't you do the same? It's like, no, I actually, I have to actually create This shit from scratch. I have to go through certain means to do it. I have now I have to think about how I'm promoting it. It's a lot of fucking details that goes into that shit. Yeah, But which means not for nothing. No disrespecting nobody that's out there doing it. Here Comes disrespect. No, you need the label.

(1h 42m 53s):
If you are a 24-year-old artist, you don't know how to promote, you don't know how to market, you don't know how to do all of those things that she spoke on. Well some People are very savvy s true skirt. Some of This shit by being popular on social media or whatever. Which is why a lot of artists are, are, are becoming more self-reliant on becoming their own engineers. Becoming their own producers. True. Having to write all their shit. 'cause they can't afford to go ahead. You got a computer and a fucking mic. You can create your own project. Now I, I know someone that does all that shit in house Mix, master produce, sing All that. That shit don't sound like fun. And if You played the label game already, then you know that the label is just Russ, Russ and La Russell is a bunch of people talking about the label is just hiring, hiring the people to go out and do these things.

(1h 43m 37s):
So that's your job to kind of backdoor and hit fucking Sam Crespo or D in Shadow or somebody that's gonna get some spins or something. Who That? The niggas that worked the records? Yeah. Gotcha. Yeah. Yeah. The building could do all they want. Who's working these records? Right. So listen, shout out to all your artists out there. Yeah. It ain't easy. Yeah, it ain't easy. Ain't easy at all. Not cheap. So yeah, if we gonna do that, if we picking you as the one, the one, the one like Travis is the one not to go back to him as the example But. yeah. Get it to 360 1. Yeah. Yeah. We need to return. Do whatever you gotta do. Some artists at the label, the the label was going to make sure that they went number one or if we saw you was behind by a little bit, all engines go to get you where you needed to be.

(1h 44m 21s):
So congratulations again, I'm off of this. That was offering a little tangent. Sorry about that. Or fuck you. Money Long's album's great by the Way. You got damn right. Lot of money. Loans Sound like money too. Yeah. Oh no. It's expensive For sure. Yeah, it sounds like money. I been here. It does. Yeah, It does. She spent for sure. She broke down almost 600 grand. 'cause her numbers was a little off. I was doing 'em in my head. She broke down 600 grand. Pre-marketing. Pre-promotion. Pre, pre every. Yeah. What the fuck? Yeah. A lot of artists don't know, like when we say single, like, 'cause that term is just single, single, single. You got a record, you got a record you gotta hit. Do you gotta hit, do you got something that go to play? You got something that can go, go, go, go, go. But when we say that It is saying to the label or the investors, this is a record that the board can approve millions for the next however many months To potentially get you your investment back.

(1h 45m 13s):
Yes. Yeah. But she had a hit record on this album. So, or has a hit record on this. Yeah. Money Long has enough equity now to She done gave enough hits to her and other people. Yeah. And she's Had a couple on her own as well. She has some on before This album, but this album, there's a hit as well. Last two, three years. She's been two years killing. She's killing on fire. Yeah. That Doshi album. Who? We was just listening on the way in. Listen, I'm, I'm, I'm getting back to my reviews.

(1h 54m 43s):
Something is going on here All day, all night, no time work. My fiance work. That is getting That is call back. That shit is hypnotizing death row into profit for me. Fingernails blood on my top hat. Nigga talking tough. I had to peel the nigga top back flowing on, beat my nigga talk back. Black bitches always bending backwards on the soft man falling face first down I was playing father figure now, now I'm making six. Now she talking to six figures now. Sick. Now would've thought that Jayla Hickman be a hit.

(1h 55m 26s):
Now ire my city despite the fact that they hated me. I'm breaking bread with bird bitches like hate the ring. Peace with the fact that I'm going shit, I'm making shit but I'm still popping shit. Nah, she's fire. That album's great. She made me wanna change my list. Yeah, I told, I said that she jumped to the front of the line. That Doci project is incredible. It is It is incredible. The second half she get into my melodic. She great, great project, great introduction again. Like I said to people that were unfamiliar, she told some stories. She told some stories about her, the road travel thus far she absolutely smoked this project.

(1h 56m 9s):
If you have not gotten it. Alligator Bites never healed. Doshi in your phone available right this second. So proud of her and so happy for her. TDE. You've managed to do it again. Word big Sean. I really like Big Sean. I do. And I hate to qualify in the beginning. 'cause that mean, you know, I'm getting to somewhere that's messy and shady. I really fuck with Big Sean. I do not like doing album reviews on Fridays when your albums drop. I don't. But because my voice and platform is so large, I do it to not do a disservice to the listener or the artist.

(1h 56m 51s):
I've been a part of too many release days where albums come out and media voices say nothing. They don't even acknowledge the project dropped So I hate to put myself in that boat. And I ran through the Sean shit. And on the weekend while I was looking at Africans with ass on Instagram, the dms pop up at the top of the phone and I saw big Sean's name and then he started saying some shit about whatever I said about the album. So I swiped the fuck outta there and went back to Anna Wass. I went back to Anna, yeah. Hey Big Sean. A fucking music review time debate or Africans with little, little, little, little waist.

(1h 57m 37s):
Huge asses with the thighs to match. Remember that out there when the thighs matched. So anyway, Oh Shit snakes. So because I wanted to make sure I stood in what I was saying or I wanted to hear big Sean's album over the weekend in a different vibe, different temperature. I gave it a run. I gave it a run Sunday. I gave it a run Monday. And I started my day Tuesday getting my hair cut to the Big Sean project. To which at the end of track 19, my barber said, is he okay? And I said, I'm not sure, but why do you say that?

(1h 58m 19s):
And he said, 'cause most of the songs that I just heard, he sound like he's going through a lot. And that kind of leads to what my issue was with the Big Sean project. They say don't share a problem without a solution. And I think the same is true in reverse. If you share a solution without a problem, it's nothing big. Sean had too many moments on this project for me. Presented solutions to problems that I never heard about. He gave me all of the, the therapeutic he gave me to my family.

(1h 59m 0s):
He gave me the I'm healed. He gave me the boundaries. Boundaries might be one of my favorite tracks on the Big Sean project. Lemme pull it up just to make sure I'm getting the names right. Yeah. Boundaries Track 18. One of my favorites on the project. But his album for the most part for me was too calm. It was very calm. I don't think it did a great job of telling me who Big Sean is today and where he is today. I think my other favorite track on here was Get You Back. Cash Cobain is on the run of all runs. Yeah he is. I don't think K Cobain could touch something and it not be fire right now.

(1h 59m 43s):
So I'm gonna, I'm gonna play that. But, well let me play that real quick because I don't wanna seem like a hater. Where is it? Where is It? is it where it, here you go. Get you back. Get you back. If I still remember how to spell big, here we go. Yeah.

(2h 0m 25s):
On smacking on your ass. I had to get you backpacking like that. I had to get you backing. Like I had to get your ass back. Bitch fucking up your spots. I know that you Got it. Forgot you was mad. I get you backing. Like get back bitch. Bitch I fuck you outta your clothes. I fuck you outta a bad day nigga. I'm in a whole with the pussy. I'm her fucking her down. She shaking down.

(2h 1m 5s):
Other than that, I didn't think that, I didn't really love the Gunner Project. Like Sean album for me is Gunner song, Gun song. I mean the gun song. I'm sorry. The Gunner song. The Gunner song. The Gunner song. And what's the name of that song? He It is what It is like from one to 10. It is a few of these that I fuck with, but it's just really, really, really, really calm for me. I know he might be trying to push the who, who you are as a single at some point. That is the the usher superstar flip. I'm gonna tell y'all for me, I have superstar.

(2h 1m 52s):
Huh? I'm playing Always yours. Hey. Whoa, whoa. Look, these bitches finna hate you. You a superstar. you know who you was. I know who you are fucking with it nigga. Let it take it too far. You the one that they got up on their moon boy When. I flick you from the back. You superstar. you know who you was. I know who you are. Hey, I know who you're, I know who you are. Your face buried in silk. I hop, I'm on top. I'm the king of the hill. Xra around your finger. He want to marry you still. I'm talking shit in your ear. You showing off in the mirror. I match your sex drive.

(2h 2m 33s):
I'm teaching you how to steer. I put you in every gear. Yeah. I asked her do she love it? She said, daddy, hell yeah. Hell. She deserve a tail number and a tail fair. You don't need a man. You need a manager. Hold up. You don't need a man. You need a camera. Man. I'm not that nigga that you caught. That's never answering. He stupid niggas fumbling the ribs. They can't handle it. Hey Tesla truck picking it up, nigga it down. Lifting up, dropping superstar. Superstar around and have a superstar kid. If you walk up to the, to the equalizer and you're trying to adjust the sound for me, the Sean Project, just remind me of everything being at 50%. It's no energy. It's no, it's, It's just a very calm mono Tone.

(2h 3m 15s):
Almost like a lofi kind of. Yeah. That Lofi can be sexy the way When I know. You said he's high. You said it's very calm. Could that just be like really maybe the project that It might be how he's on it? Yeah. That might really just be where he's at at this point. Like I don. I don't, I don't like none of the records you play either. Honestly. And I'm not and I love Big Sean. I think he's amazing. But I don't like any, like I didn't get anything from it. Nah. And I might just be where he's at mentally. Well again, I think boundaries is my favorite song. I didn't play that. But. yeah, the Gun. The Gun. The feature I like, I love the features. But When, you read 'em and then you hear what happened. It's like I am going to first listen.

(2h 3m 56s):
So I'm And and and and Sean is one of the acts that big budget or little budget I expect to hear like right after the cold. Drake and Kendrick is the next tier of Meek Wale and Sean don don't expect there to be that huge of a drop off in quality. I want to hear what the fuck you needed all this therapy about. Yeah. What was you healing from like you, you did the interviews. You, you were teary eyed. Like it looked like you had some real sentimental real transformative shit going on. I don't hear it on the album. I want to hear that.

(2h 4m 36s):
That's my problem. That's my problem. I like That thesis. I think I'm disappointed. 'cause from that first glimpse we got of him after the whole little beef, whatever the freestyle drink did in the kitchen and all that, that seemed like where I thought he was gonna go energy wise. And I was about to say that's, that's the other problem. That's the other problem. You can take it. See if you want you, you don't miss a hip hop conversation. Nah, that's the other problem. When. you work on your project like depending on how long it takes you to drop it. Where music is at as a whole might be different to change. So we coming off beef, we coming off energy, we coming off a live summertime hot out action.

(2h 5m 17s):
The best of the best is killing each other outside right now. Sean sound like he'd been working on this for a while. And if it would've dropped pre pre beef, maybe we look at different It worked. Yeah. But after the beef. Yeah, after the beef. This is just a very meditative, It's a safe, it feels very Safe. It feels like, you know how like Janae albums come with a vibe. Like his vibe on this project didn't stray too far from that for me. You Think the relationship and I guess rubbing off on him Aging and evolution and growing and maturing, I think. Yeah. But there is again, he gotta find that. He gotta find what that bop look like. As you evolve, there's some Rumblings of him and Al doing a project, which I think might be Good for him.

(2h 6m 1s):
That's what we need it be a little. That's what we need. A little dangerous. That's what we need. Let me feel a little dangerous, Sean. If you are reading this, that's what we need. We need you and Alchemist. I hate that my go-to answer for every artist is, but It is true to go get Alchemist. But It is, it's true though. But go get Alchemist. It's true. It is true. Yo. Yeah, just go to Alchemist. If you rap I don know what he, I don't know why. It's true. It's true. So that's what I got for Big Sean. All the love and respect for you. And I feel like Big Sean is a better mc than mc on the album. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. He is. That's my, that was my, he a better mc than that. That was my team. Go tear one of these niggas up. Not Kanye over, because I don't I don don't care Over slow. I apologize. Tear one of these niggas up. Even if the, even if the beats aren't popping, the the production ain't popping.

Don't really think I have anything that, oh I really did enjoy the 51. Million Dollaz. Worth Game. I did too. It's hard to hear. But I really enjoyed that. And all of the clips that are circulating, I wanted to post this one just 'cause I felt like it was important. Tough place. Oh, I wanna say this right. Tough is not, It is never what you said. It's always what you did. Right. So We know, tough We know people who do This shit, but it usually leads to them living a tough life.

(2h 52m 27s):
It starts a cycle of tough. And no matter how tough their act is, they do some raising, they getting ready to go to the home of the boldest. So they gonna be around to do that. That's what they did when they put you in the, they classify you and put you in as bad as you are. Yeah, absolutely. And then you got to show us your tough again. That's gonna extend your stay. you know what I'm talking about? Yes. So it's, It is going down Tough is not my goal man. I don't care about this. I bro, you know what's gangster to me, It is to live the way you want to live. To not have to answer to people to change things.

(2h 53m 10s):
Well said. Yeah. Can't, can't disagree or that can't disagree With I absolutely love 50 Cent. Yeah, I do. Greatest. I do. I I I wish that all of us had the pleasure of hearing him speak more often. Often, yeah. Of doing more interviews. We just need more of that because I put 50 not too far from the, the Hove and the puff and the just the, the Pharrell, the, the hip hop niggas that did it. Billion dollars. He's right in that ballpark underneath of the people that's gonna be in that position in the next five and 10 years.

(2h 53m 51s):
Monetarily. Yeah. Gotcha. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Monetarily. Shit. Impact Wise. Impact impact Wise right now we in the era of yeah, get rich in 2003. Those people are have a old now. Like they don't when they, when when they talk about hip hop this century. Oh no that's normally where they started. I wasn't saying that. I was saying that I put him over some of them. Oh maybe With regard, especially hearing him speak. Oh dog, I could hear the nigga speak all day. He just logical, he rational. He got a little humor in it. Like I could just Hear that nigga lot of humor, lot nigga You can just hear that nigga. He's hilarious. And his story is so different from the rest of them that he speaks with a con, a different conviction.

(2h 54m 35s):
He speaks with a different I. Think that shit just be logic. Like that nigga just be saying shit that makes yo you tough, right? You gonna do tough shit. It's gonna lead to more tough shit. It's going to land you with the other tough niggas. Is that that was doing tough shit. Like you now you gotta do more tough shit. He says it in a simple way. It's just his most simple, logical, rational shit. That's I love. That's what I love the most about the most about 50. He doesn't try to complicate what he says. He says it for niggas that don't want To read to read the book Real nigga Shit for dummies. Here you go. This is how simple It Is. So his interview, it did get me down my what if path, which I like to do on my head often as it pertains to hip hop. Right.

(2h 55m 14s):
He started talking about Desert Storm trying to sign him. I was present for that. So I knew what what was happening with that. But in my what if bag not to bring up Fab again, I wonder what that does. If fifties run is next to Fab on Desert Storm versus Interscope and with M like what does that even sound like? What does it look like? I I'm of the belief that 50 was gonna make it no matter where he was. So save your story to his levels To making It though. That's true. But 50 was gonna make it no matter where he was. No for sure. I don't think we get the get rich that we got. Yeah. He had a different production. you Right. So. I do think that classic album needed to be created by that West Coast conglomerate.

(2h 56m 0s):
don don't think we get that same album. I Don't think that album remotely comes out like that. Same Right. True. However, if he put out a album at that time sounding like any one of his mix tapes, it would've been successful. But 50 was never gonna fail. I would, I agree with you. I don't think he was never gonna fail, but he, he doesn't get the immediate bicoastal exposure that he got. He don't get none of the marketing, the promotional shit that he got like before Get Rich Drop 50 was on every single television station and they ask him the same exact questions. I don know. I Don't think don don't know if any of That is true. 'cause he had winks to before he got the drop. I'm not sure that he Gets the white boy audience from m not for nothing that was big like he Was big in but collar Way Different. I'm talking about the marketing piece where they was asking him, yo, what happened?

(2h 56m 43s):
Oh my mother passed away. When I was eight. She got shot. Like we knew his story, they sold the story and America loves this album. I'm talking that made, I'm talking about the musical Piece. I'm not disagreeing with y'all. I just feel like it Way different. A hit maker is a hit maker Sonically it would've just sounded way different. Yes. I'm not disagreeing with that. Alright. But a hit maker's, a hit maker. True. A hit maker is gonna be a hit maker Wherever you put him, no matter who you put him with, he's going, he gonna catch one or two or three if you That's true. I'm just saying I think that he's like that and I wonder what it would have looked like. Like I'm speculative. We'll never know now. So I'm not Argue with y'all. I I think that as a, as a collective, they would've benefited from it. Who like 'cause it. But that's everybody over there. I'm telling you somebody that was Desert Storm affiliated, I think they would've all, if he come over here, I'm lit.

(2h 57m 28s):
I feel like fucking Jordan is coming over here. And at that time, that's what I Think. Yeah. At that time, him coming wherever you at, we turn everything. It would've Behoove does a story. Oh, A thousand. I think it's a New East Coast run. A thousand per and I heard he's a workaholic. Yeah. It's a new East Coast run. I heard a nigga's a workaholic. So When, you got somebody around you that's working at that high level and at that clip it inspires other niggas to get in the studio and work just as hard. True. You think they would've did music together? Him and fab over there? Yeah. 'cause they never had no beef. They never ha But we would never heard music from them right now. Like we never heard gaming Binks on the same record Ever. Well, game kind of went a different route early.

(2h 58m 9s):
Like if game don't ever do none of that gu not shit. I think you, you will hear that. And if 50 never has the IV beef, then I, I think you'll hear that Don don't know. So what if I do think a lot of East coast rappers benefit for him staying on that side thousand percent and kind of staying, being the Jordan for the East coast. At that point we, we needed somebody. I felt like we, they we kind of lost that draft pick when he went over there a little bit. Yeah, we did. That's good point. We did shout to 50. Shout to Gillian Wallow. Amazing interview. Check it out. It is out right this second. Moving on. We don't have too much to get to here. I'll ask any of the people that are not married.
