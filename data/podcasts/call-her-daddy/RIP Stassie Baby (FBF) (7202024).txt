3:
So happy to

5:
Have you here. Disclaimer, I don't do podcasts. I don't do interviews. I've done one podcast with Zain and Heath, my close friends. But I just get so nervous when I'm talking to people, especially when there's cameras and lighting and you know, I don't know what they're gonna ask me. I also say like an all the time and I feel like it makes me sound really stupid. So I hate that. But you know, I just have anxiety.

3:
Why do you think you get so nervous to do like interviews?

5:
I honestly have no idea. Okay. Like nothing bad has like happened in the past, right. Or anything to like trigger it. I feel like it's just so like you have to be so careful with your words And. like I never want to offend anyone or like say anything that will like hurt anyone's feelings or anything like that. Or like say something that like I'm just in the middle of rambling and then it's like not actually what I mean.

3:
I appreciate that, but I appreciate you sitting down with me. I know because I'm just gonna roast your, no, I'm kidding.

5:
What? I'm like, this is what I signed up for.

3:
My first question is, was today a typical day for you? What'd you do today? Like, we're

5:
Easy kids. I went to the gynecologist.

3:
Oh my God. How did it go?

5:
It was great. It was just like a routine checkup.

3:
Okay. People are like fascinated by you. So I wanna get more granular. Like what is a morning routine of Stassy baby?

5:
Oh gosh. It depends. I wake up, I work out. I love to work out. It's like my therapy. So I work out. I'll call my manager right away after, we'll go through the day, see if I have anything that I need to do. If we have any meetings, you know, we do a little quick rundown and then I'll get my protein smoothie and then, you know, just chill. Get ready, go to lunch, take photos, do meetings.

3:
What a light.

5:
Just

3:
Relax.

5:
I don't fucking know.

3:
And then it really

5:
Depends. Every day is different.

3:
What time do you usually wake up?

5:
Nine. Nine.

3:
Do you usually have people sleeping in your bed with you?

5:
All my girlfriends sleep over all the time. And. like hopefully if I have a band. But if

3:
You, if you do have a guy, do you go to their place or do they come to you? I

5:
Like to stay at my house.

3:
That was like a really, I like to stay at my house.

5:
I to stay at my house. 'cause I have my shit, I have my makeup website. Right. My house is like catered to my guests because my friends are over all the time. Oh God. So I have like a hundred extra toothbrushes, toothpaste, deodorant. Like I have like mini toiletries for everyone to like have their set when they come over. You're such a deodorant and I. Don't wanna go to someone's house and then wake up, not have my makeup wipes. Like just, it's a whole thing. And it's like, I would look so much better if I was just moisturized.

3:
I just need a little bit of moisturizer, like maybe a little bit of foundation here and they're like, we're good to go. Good morning babe. Morning. Okay. So where did the nickname Stassy Baby come from?

5:
God, I honestly don't know because it was so long ago. I was like 13, like when I first made my Instagram Stassi baby. So I, I just remember it was, my name's Anastasia. No one could say my name. So it got shortened to Stassi. Now it's just Stass. Yeah. But it was shortened to Stassi and then I was like, oh, what's something cute? I can make my Instagram with Stassy. And then I was just like, throw a baby, like Stassy baby

3:
Dude. And it's literally stayed with you for so long. So until recently you changed. Until recently. This was like news. I know you changed your Instagram name. Everyone was pissed. Dude. Why did you change it?

5:
I just felt like it was the, it was time to end the era. It was time for a new one.

3:
Wait, no, you need to walk me through like when did it hit you?

5:
I'm not sassy baby anymore. Like I'm not a baby, I'm a woman. oh,

3:
My God

5:
Green. I'm an entrepreneur. I'm an entrepreneur.

3:
Wow.

5:
I wanna be taken seriously.

3:
I respect that. But you've kept the Stassi baby handle. Yeah,

5:
I have it. So I, I use it as like my public Finsta. I haven't posted on it in a while.

3:
But do you feel like you miss it at all?

5:
Sometimes

3:
I kind of miss it and I don't even know you. and I'm like calling you Stass. Is it okay if I call you Sta? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay.

5:
So I, I hate when people call me Stassy.

3:
Wait, and can you pronounce your full name?

5:
Anastasia car Lao.

3:
Wait, that sounded like Vampire Diaries.

5:
Oh, stop it. You know, that's my favorite show. Shut

3:
Up.

5:
I've seen all eight seasons 30 times.

3:
I am so obsessed. I remember I used to just like cry. I was so obsessed with Damon and Elena and I was just like the whole, ugh. Should we start watching it and stop podcasting?

5:
I'm on se I'm on season three right now. I just restarted it

3:
Watching just every single time. It's like the vampire shit. Same with Twilight. Like I'm obsessed. Oh, obsessed. It, it sounds like the Klaus's. What is Klaus's last name?

5:
Michaelson. Okay. You use

3:
That too loud. Okay.

5:
Dont you wanna quiz me on Vampire Diaries? I could do that. I would do that easier.

3:
Vampire Diaries

5:
Called I could, I could quiz easier Vampire Diaries than talking about myself.

3:
Okay, so you change your Instagram handle. You're no longer Stassy baby. Do people when they meet you out call you Stassy baby? No, just

5:
Stassy.

3:
Just Stass. What if you meet like fans? Like are they like Stassy?

5:
Stassy. Okay. Sometimes Stassy Baby. Like when I was in Paris Stassy they're like, Stassy baby.

3:
You're like, I'm not a baby, I'm a woman. The rebrand is strong. Okay. I respect it. Okay. You grew up. Let's just do like a little background. Okay. You grew

5:
Up, here we go.

3:
This you're like, okay, drink.

5:
I've already taken my four sips. Without

3:
You. I'm already drunk. Okay. You grew up in la What did you wanna be when you were younger?

5:
A makeup artist.

3:
Wow.

5:
My mom was a makeup artist so I wanted to be a makeup artist.

3:
Do you do your makeup a lot by yourself or do you get glam?

5:
I get glam a lot but I do my makeup a lot. I'm very specific with Glam. So if I don't have my people that I trust, then I would rather do it myself. Did

3:
You do this yourself? No. Okay. I was gonna say sweetie, I need to book you because whoa, I don't even see it fucking poor. like you look perfect right now in, in person. Really? Thank you. Yeah, you look great. I look

5:
Like you added in person.

3:
You look awful on Instagram but in person. My God. This is just fire. No, your skin looks amazing. You look great.

5:
Thank you.

3:
Did you have dreams of being famous when you were younger?

5:
Not at all.

3:
Did anyone in your family, was anyone anyone in your family famous? No.

5:
Everyone thinks like my, my family's like, not even like didn't, I didn't come from money. Like I just got like thrown into this world.

3:
People can like come up with these storylines of like where you're from, And. like I would assume a lot of people think like, oh she's just like a rich bitch just because of like the crowd you roll in. Yeah. And. like what your life looks like now. Like

5:
I take care of my family.

3:
Damn. So you really are, that's it's a good thing you dropped the baby. You are a fucking woman. This is literally, you're coming out as like a full rebrand. Oh my gosh. You were homeschooled in high school. What led to that decision to pull you outta school?

5:
There's like a lot of reasons why I was homeschooled. One, I think I didn't like really mesh with a lot of people at the schools that I went to. Okay. A lot of my friends were homeschooled. My mom is an addict. So growing up like there was just a lot of commotion going on. And, like we switched schools a bunch 'cause we were moving around like lived with my aunt or my grandma and my dad And. like, it was just like a whole thing. So it was just easier to be homeschooled so that we could like take our schoolwork with us. Got it.

3:
So your sister was homeschooled with you? My sister was too. And it's just you and your sister?

5:
Me and my sister. You've

3:
Been open about like social anxiety. Can you explain what social anxiety looks like for you?

5:
Oh gosh. I don't know. I just like, it's when I'm around or when I'm in situations where I don't feel like super comfortable or Like don don't know a lot of people or just feel like I'm, I shouldn't be there. Like I'm out of place. Like even when I was just at the Oscar parties, like I felt so awkward being there that I was like, why am I here? Like, what am I doing here? It's like why am I invited to this place? And then I just get so in my head about it that I just like keep spiraling and then I'm just spiraling and spiraling. And then

3:
Do you think that that's, it's gotten worse as you've like gotten bigger?

5:
Yes and no. Like it's easier to deal with because I feel like I've, you know, accepted it more And, like talking about it like helps so much. Like even the fact that I would like try and hide it and then I'd just like sit here and have mini panic attacks by myself. But even me coming here and being like, Hey, I'm so nervous. Yeah. Like talking about it And, like letting people know helps so much because then they like work with me on it and I don't feel so like scared.

3:
I get what you're saying. Like I didn't really have ever social anxiety in my life until like the past few years. and I feel the same way with you. Like when I walk in, dude, the event I saw you at, I was fully having a panic attack and when I saw you, we had met once over FaceTime and I like you. And I'm like, Hey stop. You're like, what's your name again? I'm like, no, it's not that. I don't, I know, but we, but it's like when you're in environments where like I don't usually go to those events so I can relate. Is there anything your friends do to help you in those moments?

5:
Yeah, like I'll, I'll, if I'm feeling really like weird and uncomfortable, I start to like kind of separate. Like not even separate. Like I'll still be standing right next to 'em, but I'll allow like the circle to kind of close a little where I'll kind of just be staring at everyone's backs and they like know to make sure it's open. And like my friend the other day, like put his hand around my waist, And like pushed me into the circle so that I could be part of the conversation. You said, Hey stop,

3:
Stop doing

5:
That. He's like, stop like putting yourself like stop not talking. When

3:
You were younger, even though you had social anxiety, like were you, like, what was your personality? Were you outgoing,

5:
Shy? I honestly don't think I had social anxiety until people started knowing who I was. So like until like my Instagram started to grow, that's when I like got nervous. 'cause I was like a crazy child. I would love to like put on performances for my fam. Like my family, my, my dad had these like medicine balls and I would like put them in my like my little tank top that had a built-in bra when I was like seven And like start bouncing them up. And like, I was just like funny And like super outgoing. Right? And then one day I was just like, became a little hermit.

3:
Yes. Your life changed at 13 years old when you became friends with someone who's one of The most famous people now in the world. But from what I read, you met at a bookstore.

5:
Where did you read

3:
This dude? I read it online at Barnes and Noble. I was like did stop at Barnes and Noble. We did

5:
Read at Barnes and Noble. Okay,

3:
Thank you. You're like, where did you read that? I'm like, is it true? You're like, yeah, I worked there, but

5:
Like how do people know

3:
That? Dude? I don't know. I was literally just Googled it. Okay. I was Googling you. Okay. I was doing my due diligence. Okay, but how did attending a fan event turn into like, oh, it

5:
Wasn't a fan event. Wait, I thought it was,

3:
Well, like Kylie dude, I, I read it was a, it was like a book movie.

5:
No, no, we were holding, we, oh, we did take a photo. Like maybe that's how people know we were holding like books. But it was like a fully friend hangout. Like my friend who was good friends with her brought me and we all like met up like in, there's this place called the Calabasas Commons. Okay. And when we were in middle school, this is so good. It was Friday night, it curfew was 10:00 PM Friday night. If you weren't dropped off at the Commons at 7:00 PM like you weren't, you weren't cool. So you get dropped off at 7:00 PM walk around, like go into the restaurants, And, like just do a bunch of shit stupid. Like literally walk back and forth up and down. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And so we met at Barnes and Nobles on one of the Friday hangs.

3:
I quite literally

5:
Not at a fucking fan event.

3:
Dude. Dude. I was like, I just have to ask you this one question because I literally thought you showed up to her book release and I was like, damn. Like STAs met Kylie at a book release and I and then

5:
They became Best Taste

3:
And I was gonna ask you. I'm like, how did you like go up and approach her to be friends if she was like signing your book. I was also like, did she write a book? and

5:
I, I get your number.

3:
STAs did not. That is everyone get Barnes and Noble. Okay. Can you at least explain how did you meet? Because after that you're like

5:
Changed. We met through friends.

3:
Okay. So when was the first time that you remember being like photographed by paparazzi?

5:
Ooh. Honestly like, not the, not within like the first like year of our friendship. Okay. Like, like after we were really friends. Like after we were already, you know, then we, and we would also used to like fuck with them. Like there's photos of us in like juicy tracksuits, And. like we didn't know what the fuck paparazzi was. Like it was so new me to me one, but to her too. So there's photos that we would be like, like posing for them.

3:
Remember the duck face? Like

5:
We literally would do that. There's photos on the internet. Was

3:
It weird? I'm trying to put myself in like 14-year-old Alex.

5:
Oh it was so weird. But it was also like funny. Yeah. Like I was like, I was Like. what is happening?

3:
Like what did your family think about you being like starting to become in the public eye?

5:
I don't even know. I haven't even asked them.

3:
Call your dad right now.

5:
I think, I mean I know that they're proud of me. Okay. I just Like don don't know what they thought about it when I was younger. That's actually a good question. I wanna ask him like, what did you think?

3:
I'm trying to think of like, you are technically still a high schooler. He

5:
Probably thought it was so weird. But

3:
When I Did he like ever tell you not to go out or something? Like were they strict? No, no,

5:
No, no. They weren't strict. So you

3:
Got to just, I

5:
Had a curfew but like, I like practically lived at Kylie's house.

3:
So you were just like doing your thing And, like your parents weren't like freaking out. Like we saw these photos. Oh, you're giving gang signs. Dad, that's a peaceful,

5:
They like, they have my location like on my phone. My dad still has my location on my phone because I'll like fly to from New York and I'll forget to like tell him that I'm leaving. So if he doesn't have my location, he has a panic attack. So he has my location on, on his phone. He always has.

3:
He's like, are you Ino? You're like, oh sorry, forgot. Oh, sorry. He's like, we were supposed to have dinner tonight. You're like, I was like across the world. I

5:
Was like, shit, sorry about the club now. I just like would check in with them, like call them every hour. Okay. Always keep them updated on like where I was because, so I was good about that. So they trusted me. Yeah. And they also like would always talk to my friend's parents. Okay. Before like I would even sleep at someone's house and then once like they got to like know Yeah. What I was doing And, like where I was going and knew that I was safe. Then they were just chill.

3:
Being 14 years old, And like having pictures taken of you. And it must've been weird for you 'cause you're like, I know that. I'm like, I'm not doing much. Like I'm just standing here. Like why? I'm just like getting my photo taken. Like it's a weird experience. Yeah. But now are you used to paparazzi? Yeah. like you're not freaked out by it anymore? No. Does it give you social anxiety though? No,

You're like, I look so fucking good. It doesn't,

5:
I'm not talking and I just like walk.

3:
Okay, so that, so it's mostly talking? Yes. You're okay getting photographed.

5:
I'm completely fine getting photographed. I actually love photo shoots. It's one of my favorite things to do really?

3:
I

5:
Love to like get dressed up and do a photo shoot, get hair and makeup And, like put a cool outfit on and take photos. It's only talking. I don't know why it's talking with, it's honestly with camera, without camera. Like speaking in general, it's just speaking for some reason it throws me off when I'm not comfortable with the person. Okay, got it. But even like now, like I'm obviously I'm more comfortable like, don't feel we have a

3:
Little bit bit of vodka that's helping. Yeah. Okay. I'm taking another sip. Okay. That was, that was it. This so far you're okay, right? This is not painful. You're doing great.

5:
No, this is fun. I like your little like, you know, research too

3:
Too. Let me just clarify one more time. STAs did not work at Barnes Noble was not, I'll be finding my research team.

5:
I was not a fan outta a book reading

3:
When I was reading. I'm sorry, I can't get over it. That's like the one trailer of the episode.

5:
I'm like, is that what it says?

3:
It literally said STAs went to Barnes and Noble for a fan book signing and met Kylie there and I was like, damn. Like, like how did he, people can now look you. How did she do that? Like, dreams do come true man. Like people like I wanted to be friends with Harry Styles. You just walk right into the book signing and Baboo

5:
Start talking to him. STAs will give you the advice on how to do it.

3:
You created a business for yourself on social media. You've bought a house. Wait, did

5:
I sold my house.

3:
You're moving a lot. You got a dog, you're done with the dog. Well you already sold your

5:
House. I sold my house and I'm doing like a lease back right now.

3:
Didn't you literally just renovate the entire fucking thing? I,

5:
I redid the backyard because the part where you're supposed to like tan was, it was like shady all day. So I moved the tanning portion.

3:
Do you tan your face?

5:
No,

3:
Neither. oh my

5:
God. I wear a hat. Yeah. And then I'll like put the towel.

3:
I love the definitive like no,

5:
This part of my body is safe. Yeah. And this part is tan.

3:
So smart. But

5:
I oil I like really, I'm really bad with my body. Okay. 'cause I love to be like super dark. I get spray tans weekly. Oh. So when it's summer and it's hot out and the UUVs high, I'm out there just like cooking.

3:
It's creepy that we all know each other's lives through Instagram. And I'm like, you just read it your house and you're like, I've never had you over. I'm like, I think I, so on social media, I'm like, what about the backyard?

5:
I mean that's kind of what you sign up for when you facts post your shit all over YouTube and Instagram and everywhere else. Wow.

3:
So now you're looking for a new house. Yeah. Does it feel surreal to you that you can just like do this or you kind of Oh,

5:
100%. Like it's so weird and I honestly, like a lot of the times feel, what's the right word here? I feel I, I wouldn't say bad, but I, it makes me feel weird because my family is not in the same like position as I am. So I, I feel weird being like, oh I want this, this and this. And then like, my dad's in an apartment and then I'm like, how am I getting this big house for myself but not get it. Like not getting him a house, dude or my sister a house or like, you know, it just makes me feel weird sometimes. Listen,

3:
I totally get that. I am in a similar situation right now where like it's it's amazing you for yourself Yeah. Having success. But when you change your lifestyle, like it's weird to have like you wanna take care of everyone. Everyone. But you also have to live for the rest of your, your life and take care of yourself. And You don't know how it's all gonna like long it's gonna last. Yeah. You gotta be smart. It's like it's a lot.

5:

Missouri :
This episode is brought to you by Missouri. You know I had a thought the other day. Since Ru wonder jury becomes something we only bought on special occasions, Missouri approaches fine jewelry a little bit differently. Each one of their pieces is handcrafted by jewelers committed to quality craftsmanship as well as ethical and sustainable jewelry production created by Women for Women. Missouri is breaking down barriers in what has long been an exclusive and occasional category of men buying for women. In 2020, the brand launched the Missouri Empowerment Fund in support of higher education for underrepresented women and non-binary individuals. Because fine jewelry doesn't have to cost the world. Feel good about your jewelry in more ways than one. Start stacking your favorites. Shop online or visit the website to find a store near you.

3:
We're transitioning to fund. Okay. You can only smoke weed or drink for the rest of your life. What are you

5:
Doing? Drink. I get like panic attacks when I smoke weed. I was

3:
Gonna ask, do you smoke?

5:
I don't smoke. I I can smoke. I can smoke with my two friends, Sydney and Victoria if I've had a little to drink and we've all had a little to drink. Yeah. Because when I smoke I feel like I get so stupid and I laugh at everything for too long. And all my friends smoke all the time. So they don't get as affected. Yes. As I do with weed. So I'm sitting there and I'm like, I feel so self-conscious. It amplifies my anxiety because even with my best fucking friends, yes. I'm like, I feel like I'm being weird right now. Like, why did I just say that? Or why did I laugh so long? Or whatever it is like, oh, this one time I got high and I was by myself and I went upstairs and went to bed and then I was like, ugh. My, I like hit the stove.

5:
I turn the stove on when I was walking upstairs, walk back downstairs turnt, make sure all the knobs are good. Walk upstairs. My hip like touches the stove. I get back in bed. oh my God, my hip touched the stove. It turned the stove on my, my gas is on so I go downstairs eye level with the stove, like checking all the knobs. Like I get so paranoid. It's like this isn't fun. Awful. This, this

3:
Isn't fun dude. You're is someone in my house right now? Yes. Like And. like everything Dude, I, I relate to that a lot though. 'cause smoking can be so fun at times if you're trying alone. But in a group setting, like you've gotta really have some tolerance because you can fucking go down a spiral and the saddest thing knows when you're sitting there with your thoughts and you're like, did I just sound dumb? And you

5:
Can't get rid of it. Like how do you get rid of it?

3:
Okay. So you're drinking for the rest of your life. No smoking.

5:
No smoking. Okay.

3:
If your best friend was here right now, how would she describe Drunk Stassy?

5:
Hmm. I don't know. Fun, crazy. The life of the party.

3:
I love that answer. You kind of exude that energy.

5:
Thanks.

3:
What is to you life of the party mean?

5:
I don't know. I just like to make sure everyone's having a good time. Everyone's like flowing, dancing, everything's set up good. The vibes are great. Everyone's comfortable.

3:
You're this like caring, loving, maternal.

5:
My friends call me mama. Like I have a group chat with me and all my boys. Stop

3:
Mama, change that.

5:
Stop

3:
It. Like

5:
No, I have a group chat with me and all my guy friends and it's called Mama and Her Boys.

3:
Okay, so you kind of are like this maternal figure. Where did that come from?

5:
I honestly dunno. I've always been like that. That's ing always. Like everyone calls me when they need some like help with something.

3:
Do you think you're a people pleaser?

5:
Probably a little.

3:
Do you ever feel like with all of your life successes And, like your fame, like do you ever feel like you're like taken advantage of?

5:
I don't think so. I feel like I have a really small group of people around me. Smart. I mean not small. I have a group so I have like nine people. It's huge.

3:
It's

5:
Huge. Nine people but like out of those people, like I don't, I'm not close with anyone else. Got it. Like I don't tech, like we have a group chat and yeah it has nine people but that's the only, the only thing I text in all day if it's not like my family. Okay.

3:
We're at a pre-game. Okay. Where is Stassi? Are you at the ox cord? Are you pouring shots? Are you taking pictures of the girls? like

5:
You Definitely pouring shots. Okay. Definitely making the drink and taking photos. Love that. We like to like get ready and then everyone will eat at my house and then we'll make drinks and make tiktoks. Okay,

3:
So your pre-game is everyone gets ready alone. Like makeup, we

5:
Get, we get ready on FaceTime. Love that. If we're, if we're, if we're not together, we're getting ready on FaceTime the whole time. Do do you coordinate outfits? No, we don't coordinate but we tell each other what each other's wearing so we can catch a vibe. The vibe. So make sure we're all like on the same vibe. No one's in like a dress in stilettos and sneakers and bag pants. Like if one's gonna be uncomfortable, we're all gonna be uncomfortable. If someone's gonna be comfortable, we're all gonna be comfortable.

3:
Remember when you were younger, I don't know if you ever had this, but when girls were like insecure and they would like want their friend and not look as good and they're like, you should wear that.

5:
I don't understand that. I'm the first person to be like, bitch, take that off. You look nuts. That does not look good. Sell those jeans. Go to wasteland.

3:
Dude, I respect that because it's like, that means you're secure with yourself that you're not trying to like I'm just get others look ugly

5:
Around you. Like why would you want that? Like I don't, I never understood that mentality 'cause I just want everyone to feel comfortable. Yeah. And look good and feel good. Totally And, like feel good with themselves. And then everyone has so much more fun When you feel like good about totally how like you like as shitty as that kind of sounds. No feel.

3:
It

5:
Makes you feel better to go out when you feel good about your appearance and that's just it. Like if I look like shit, I'm like fuck,

3:
You're so right because like there's nothing better than going out one night and when you're like, I look fucking amazing. You have a better fucking night.

5:
You like exude that energy. Yes. And everyone like, and then everyone's like kind of drawn to you. That's why I'm like confidence. Like no matter what, even when I feel the shittiest, if I'm leaving my house, I, I'm like, you're a fucking sexy bitch. Yes. And then I walk out the door and I just will think that and you know, have drinks make to make myself think that even more. Try and exude that energy because if I don't then I'm just gonna be sitting there like then about it all night.

3:
When you leave the house, what is like a night where you're like, oh fuck. Like I don't, I feel ugly. Like what would you, is there something like you sometimes have worn that you're like, why did I do this? Or like a hairstyle you've ever tried? Like when are you like, fuck, why did I do this?

5:
I won't, like I'll just go fix it. Okay. Because I'm like,

3:
I can't have fun.

5:
I'm like, why would I go to like, I'll be 20 minutes late to this dinner And, like feel better about myself than to sit there the whole time and not talking to anyone And. like maybe coming off as rude or like, you know, not engaging. oh my God. That scared the shit outta me Henry.

3:
Okay, so you're, you're just saying like you will be rather late than like feel like shit. Yeah,

5:
Because then I agree like more, you know, just me like talkative, just feeling good.

3:
Are you usually on time you're like, you know what, we don't need to call each other out on every,

5:
I like to say I'm on time most of the time.

3:
Next question. Okay. Fair.

5:
I I try to be but sometimes you can't help it.

3:
You know what though? I respect that and I'm actually gonna take that from you of like, if you don't feel good, why not be 20 minutes late? Especially if it's with like a group of friends going out and fucking make sure you feel better about

5:
Yourself. Like I don't need to rush myself to go to dinner at the nice guy.

3:
Like you do not need to rush.

5:
Like

3:
At

5:
All. I get it. If it's like a, an event And, like you have to be there at a certain time and totally. You know, you gonna miss the event. If You don't then, then that's the situation where like you get ready, I get ready like three hours before I'm supposed to leave my house and glam only takes two hours. So I give myself an extra hour in case the glam goes longer up in case I need to fix something in case my outfit doesn't end up working out. Like I always give myself extra time when I know that there's actually a time I need to be somewhere

3:
Very smart.

5:
But if it's just like a random night and I end up hating something, I'm like okay, leave without me. I'll meet you guys there. Right.

3:
You're like meet you at Craig's in 45 minutes. Yeah. We'll fucking catch you later.

5:
I order my honey troubled chicken

3:
The bread.

5:
So good.

3:
Okay. What is your ideal night out?

5:
I love to have nights at my house. Fun are my favorite nights

3:
Fun.

5:
So I love to, we'll have like dinner at my dining room table, like set it up all cute and then we'll go to my living room and my kitchen and we'll just like play games. And Do

3:
You like going to clubs still?

5:
I, I go to clubs every once in a while but I'm not really a club girl. I like to be able to have, which this is gonna contradict everything I'm saying. I like to have conversations, like to be able to

3:
Talk. I have social anxiety. I hate speaking but I love conversations. But like house

5:
Parties with my friends. Yeah. That doesn't give me anxiety. Okay,

3:
That makes sense. So I like

5:
To be able to, in a club you can't like have a conversation. You're all just standing there dancing, listening to music and drinking. Totally. There's no any sort of talking happening unless you wanna scream to the person next to you. No, no problem. So I like to be able to like sit down, talk, go outside, you know, just dance.

3:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get that. Okay. You have a lot of friends. The internet is fascinated by your girl group and I guess guy group. 'cause you literally just said there's nine people in your group chat.

5:
Well that's like my girl group chat. I have a few, my boy, my guy one is separate.

3:
How many group chats do you have?

5:
I have like four or five. But some of them like are with other people with like added like they're confusing. Okay. Like we have one with all, all nine of us. And then I have one with like five of them. And, like two other friends. And then I have one with my two friends that are in the nine group chat. But we just Like don don't know, they're, it's all confusing.

3:
Who is your go-to though? Like when you're dealing with family shit or like you get bad news?

5:
My friend Victoria.

3:
Okay. That's your go-to How long have you guys known each other

5:
For like 10 years.

3:
How do you think outsiders view your friend group?

5:
I would hope that they would like, think it was cute. Like we're all just, we all just like love each other so much. And like support every little thing that we do. Right. And just want like each other to succeed when, so I would hope that would like make other friend groups wanna do that first. Like what you were talking about earlier when friend groups like want someone to like not look good so they look better. Totally. Like we genuinely just want all of, all of us to like succeed And. like do the best that we could do and we're fun.

3:
Okay. I was gonna say like if someone walks into a party and your whole group is there, are you guys like the loud ones? The fun ones, like intimidating? Like what do you think is your vibe?

5:
I think we're fun and I. Think we,

3:
I think you're a little totally intimidating. Oh

5:
Right,

3:
Right. You're like, oh, I thought we were punched. I thought

5:
We, I think we like tap into everyone. Okay, you do.

3:
So you guys

5:
Have your core group. When we go out, we have our core group and we'll start together and we'll all put our stuff down at like the same table. Okay. But then like I won't see like some of them for the whole night. Okay. That's fun. We like tap into everyone that's around us. That's fun. You And then sometimes we have nights where we're just like,

3:
Okay, that's fun to know. So if people see you out, like it's not like you're like we only sit together. Oh no, you're not like the mean girls table.

5:
Not where

3:
You're like, we are not moving. No. No. Okay, that's good. Who in your friend group matches your party energy?

5:
All of them. We're all everyone Psycho.

3:
You're like every single one of the nine we're

5:
All crazy. Really. Well, mainly I would say it's like me, Victoria, Carter, Sydnee, it's all of us. Drew Kelsey,

3:
Like And like wait, no, we're all,

5:
It's, it's, I would, yeah, we're all nuts.

3:
I'm wondering why do I feel like you're the type of person that like someone wouldn't know that you're like that fucked up.

5:
Okay. Everyone tells me that. Like, can

3:
I read your watch?

5:
Like I'll be like blackout and wake up with the hangover scaries and be like, you guys, what the fuck did I do last night? I was blacked out. And they'd be like, you were drunk. I thought you were sober.

3:
Dude, I don't, you give off that vibe that like you

5:
Keep your shit together. But once you know me, I have this look in my eye and you can tell that no one's home.

3:
When is the last time you like had like an awful fucking like did? I don't even know the last time I like threw up from alcohol. Like are,

5:
I've never thrown up from alcohol.

3:

5:
I was like, I was definitely like 15.

3:

5:

3:
Okay,

5:
I'm gonna get arrested. I'm like 25.

3:
Do you get hungover

5:
Sometimes? Depending on like, okay, so okay.

3:
She's like, here we go.

5:
Here we go, here we go. If I take like, you know those little puff things? Yeah. Yeah. If I have a night and I'm drinking And, like sometimes I'll say Like I don. I'm a social smoker. Like I love to like hit a little something when I'm drinking. If I hit a puff, I wake up so hungover because I feel like once I hit it once then I'm like addicted to it. Got it. and I wanna hit it all night. And then I'm smoking this little fucking vape all night and you can smoke them anywhere. I don't know what it does to me. I get so hungover. But if I have like a little hit of a cigarette and you're fine, I'm fine

3:
Vape. So You don't, don't get that hungover though. But it's from those like you're

3:
You have vlogs where you're very open about the work that you have had done. How did you come to the decision to be so open about And? like vlog about certain things?

5:
Hmm. I don't like, I feel like everyone, there's such a stigma on plastic surgery and I feel like whether you say that you've done it or whether you don't say you've done it, people are going to find a way to say something about it. And, like make it a negative thing and I just like, don't really care for me. I was just like, this is what's happening in my life. And you know, I'm blogging about it.

3:
I always see comments of people being like, you need to own up. Yeah, you need to own

5:
Up. Did it. You need to tell everyone. And then it's also no one needs to tell anyone anything if they don't want to.

3:
Then if they do come out and say it, it's like, we knew it. You fake bitch. And it's like, yeah,

5:
You're so fake. Like whatever. It's

3:
A very double standard. I agree with you. If you say it, it's like wow, you're fake. And if you don't it's like you're a liar. And it's like, exactly.

5:
But it's also like, oh, you're setting the beauty standards and people and you're not saying what you're doing. So you're making people think that you naturally look like this, but then you say it and then they're like, oh, you're fake as fuck. Like money can really buy, looks like people go on And, like say the nastiest shit.

3:
Yeah. And it's like, what about it just being like you wanted to do it for yourself? Yeah,

5:
Like I wanted to feel good about my titties, so I did. I did them other things too. Okay. And that's, and that's that. and I don't owe that to anyone. and I don't need to like tell anyone, but Like don don't care to like, if someone comes and one of my friends asks me something, I'll be like, oh yeah, do this. I literally got my lips tattooed yesterday because like when you get lip filler, it like ruins the color of your lip naturally. Like I, my lips were so pink and then you get filler and it, I swear it like makes your lips turn almost like white a little. So I like got them tattooed and then it like, is this dark color? It would be, and it peels off and then it just becomes like a natural pink. It looks

3:
Really

5:
Good so that I don't have to wear lip liner all the time. It looks really good. Thank you.

3:
What was the first procedure you had done?

5:
Lip filler. Not at a good place, like do your research. Oh, okay. I like didn't do it good. I looked like, like not cute. I had to dissolve it all, get it redone. I have like this thing where I talk out of one side of my mouth and one side of my mouth sits higher than the other side. and I've tried to correct it with lip filler so many times that it ends up just looking worse. And now that I like dissolved it all and just like tried to even them out as much when I'm not speaking, I still like all my comments are, her lips are lopsided. Like, you're so botched. and I'm like, I literally have like a drop of lip filler on one side of my lip.

3:
What does it make you feel when people comment that shit?

5:
I don't really care. I've like let it get to me so many times and now I'm just like, you don't know me, I don't know you. So like how are you gonna sit here And like comment on me, like sit And, like talk about my lips. Like I'm sorry, that's how I talk, right? Like I talk one side of my mouth. That's how I was born. So you wanna make fun of how I was born And. like say that it was my lip fillers when it's just the way that I speak and the way that my mouth sits and the way my jaw moves. Like now you're just being mean. And that sucks. Like, think about that no one wants to get work done and not have it look good. So like think about like, okay, someone's getting work done and doesn't look good. Like do you really think that's how they wanted it to turn out? So that's like shitty. And then they like spent all this money and they don't like the way that they look. That's like sad to me.

5:
Like I feel bad. Like I'm not gonna sit there and comment And like be like, oh you look so fucking ugly. Like your lips are so fucked. Like, no, I'm gonna like, if I know the person, like reach out, like give a recommendation if they like wanna talk about it. But you know, and I've said that so many times on my YouTube too, I'll be like, I know you guys are gonna fucking come for my lips again. like you always do And. like still my comments are mean. And I'm like, okay, well if all you mean people have something to say, like maybe if you commented like, Hey girl, like I totally get what you're going through. Like here's a place that I've seen on Instagram that like whatever. I'd be like, oh my God. That person's so nice.

3:
I actually really appreciate that point though. You're like, hey, like if someone's getting work done, they're trying to either enhance something that they like or

5:
Fix or insecurity, fix insecurity.

3:
That's what it is. Anyone, whether it's all the way down to editing a photo or Exactly. Getting work done guys. I get it. But like, come on. Do you wanna know why I did it? It's 'cause I felt like fucking shit about myself. And like when you're talking about it, it's like, wait, that's such a good point. If like someone's like, oh that's botch or that's not

5:
Cute. I also hate that so much because with the editing thing, your body could look completely different from one minute to like 10 minutes. Like I'll be in the gym and I'll be doing my abs and my abs will be poking out and obviously that's what I take my story. You're like, my abs will poking out. But then I'll go and have a protein smoothie and then like eat a whole fucking lunch and my abs aren't showing anymore. And then they're, then they'll compare photos like same day. Look at the difference like, oh, she photoshopped that. I feel like everyone's body has changed so much. You uploaded, you're on vacation. Like I got this one photo like sneaky taken of me at a pool and I was blacked out and I was like sitting and I'm like sitting like this and I'm like, yeah, okay.

5:
When I sit like this, I have like a roll that H hangs out versus when I'm stretching and posing And like my abs are popping out. And I'm like, how are you gonna like compare two different poses? And like yeah, everyone's body like moves.

3:
Have you ever gotten anything done that you regretted?

5:
I wouldn't say regret.

3:
Okay.

5:
I would say that I've gotten stuff done that I didn't like the results, but not regret. Okay. Fixable.

3:
So you're saying that like something you didn't like the outcome, but if you had gotten it somewhere else, you would've still wanted it, but you didn't like the result or you would take it back?

5:
I wouldn't take it back.

3:
Okay. You just didn't like the outcome?

5:
Yeah. Well at,

3:
Do you wanna specify?

5:
At the time I wanted it and for the time I liked it, but I have taken it back.

3:
And you've never spoken about your butt. Have you had butt implants?

5:
I have not had butt implants. The only implants that I have are in my titties. And I'm not saying that I haven't done other things and I haven't, you know, moved some things around or you know, whatever the case may be. But I, yeah, just like feel like I was at a point in my life when I was younger and I felt like my lips needed to be big and my boobs needed to be big and you know, everything your butt needs to be, my butt needed to be big And. like over the past like couple years, it's, I like made my implants smaller. I've, you know, tried to make everything smaller because I just like the more natural look and I feel.

5:
like, you know, you get caught up when you're younger. You like don't really know. Like, like if you ask me even like I some like a simple question years ago verse now like you're, you change, you grow up, you like learn things, you see things differently. And like for me it's just like, I like to look like I wanna look natural. Yeah. I don't wanna look plastic, I don't wanna look fake. I don't wanna look like, you know, I wanna look natural. I wanna look like me.

3:
We as women are made to feel like we need to fit a mold. Exactly. And, and so I respect you for being honest about it because it's obvious. But also you're made to feel like,

5:
Am I, I can't say anything. Yeah. Or like it's like such a taboo thing to say. And then, and then people like we were saying earlier, earlier, hate you for not saying something or think you're so fake for not saying something but the second you open up about it, they're like, oh, that fake bitch. and I'm like, no, I was just really fucking young and stupid And. like maybe I don't like to talk about it because I don't like the decision I made when I was fucking 18 to like now me being almost 25, like trying to reverse my dumbness And. like maybe it's something I am self-conscious about that I don't like about myself that I like, you know, I'm working to fix

3:
For a while. It was like tit implant. It's like, oh God. It used to be like such a thing. And now it's like, oh, she got her tits

5:
Done. Yeah. Like my li I had to fix my implant the other day and I was like, new, new hair, new tits. Yeah. Yeah. And it's like, so like fine to say,

3:
But if anyone's like, oh, I got my butt done. It's like,

5:
You did.

3:
You did. You are. oh my God,

5:
You're the devil. And now it's like the more natural version of it. Like I have like friends who like you would never guess and they've, and they've done it.

3:
So Do you regret when you see your friends like that and you're

5:
Like, oh. And I'm like, fuck, I did it so early, I didn't know what I was doing. I should have waited and done that.

3:
Do you think you had this moment of realizing you didn't maybe want certain things you did as much and like you went a little too far?

5:
I don't know. There was this one moment where I was like, it wa I was just like so insecure being like, I hate this Like. don don't wanna get in a bathing suit in front of anyone. and I was in Greece, And like, I'm Greek so I can understand Greek. and I was in Greece and I was walking on the beach and I heard this guy talk about me be like behind my back being like something like, oh, look at her. Like she's so, like, she's full of plastic and I like heard him say that. and I wanted to start crying and I was like, this is so fucked. I'm about to start crying. And yeah, I was like, fuck this.

3:
It's even down to like makeup and, and hair coloring. It's like we're as women in a really weird position where like we've been made to feel like our looks are so important. Like

5:
So important. And especially in this like industry, it's like if you're not, if you have like one slip up and you're like not looking your best one time and someone gets a photo, it's like immediately you're catfish immediately you're fucked, you're botched, you're this, you're that. Yeah. It's like you can't have one day where you like are just like, Hey, I wanna like show up with my fucking hair and a ponytail. You can see all my extensions. I have no makeup on. Like, I'm just chilling. I wanna get lunch. oh

3:
My God. I do think that you should also be happy with yourself in just terms of like life and growing up and the fact that you're like, oh, I'm realizing, you know what, like I wanna be just like natural stassy. Like that's kind of dope too though. You're at that point in your life.

5:
I mean, it's a little too late for that. Like, I'm trying to get there.

3:
What were your normal tit size?

5:
My boobs were always big One was just bigger than the other. Oh, okay.

3:
So you were

5:
Just filling and they were like a little saggy.

3:
You got

5:
The lift Saggier. So I got a little,

3:
Was the lift painful?

5:
Mm. I mean I've had like such problems with my boobs. I've had to fix them like multiple times. I have like really thin skin, so my implants like fallen out of the pocket like multiple times. Like

3:
Dude,

5:
My friend Carter was telling me this story, I don't even remember it. It was like Coachella like two years ago. And like my skin just like is so thin. So it like stretches. And he was telling me that I was like wasted and, or I was super hungover or something, I don't even remember. And he was like trying to get me outta bed to go to this day party. And I was like, Carter, I literally, I'm not going anywhere. My implant just flipped.

3:
I was like,

5:
I was like, no way. I said that. and I remember like, oh my God, my implant. Like actually like flipped over one time.

3:
Wait, so it's like up by like

5:
Your taller bone. Like it just like flipped. Like the back was Like

3:
I. don know. I dunno why we're laughing. This is,

5:
It's really not funny. It's really not funny. But I had to like, you know, fix it. I put like an internal bra And like hold my implant in my boob.

3:
I remember my mom had this saying of like, you can, you can get a tattoo if you wait for full two years. And you still want that exact same thing. Exactly. Tattoo. Do you think that there should be like an age limit? We're allowed to get this shit done? That's really, yeah,

5:
That, I don't know. That's such an interesting question because like for me, like it is an age thing, but I also feel like it's a times thing. Yeah. So it's like, yeah, if it was still the same as it was when I was 18 And, like when I was 21, if the trend was still kind of the same thing right then Yeah, I would've probably done the same thing at 21 verse 18. But it wasn't. And it's not, and it's like just it's, it's like why? Like how are you gonna change your whole life based on like a trend? That's like a couple years,

3:
Dude. No, it's crazy. 'cause we think about like cargo pants are back in and we're like, Ooh. And then I'll throw them out after low,

5:
Like low rise jeans?

3:
Yeah, low rise jeans. But like

5:
Completely different.

3:
Yeah. Like an ass And, like tits, And like lips and it's like it's,

5:
It's like you're cosmetically changing you, your being like, versus like throwing away some jeans. Yeah.

3:
Okay. We're gonna do a little rapid fire. Oh fuck yes. This is like, kind of like our ending game. Okay. Who is the last person you searched on Instagram?

5:
I don't have my phone. Get

3:
Your phone.

5:
It was a clothing company.

3:
Oh, cute. Because you were like purchasing off of there.

5:
I was asking them to gift me clothes.

3:
I wanna free shit.

5:
Well they gift me clothes. I was asking for their new stuff.

3:
Who is pinned for your text messages?

5:
Pinned. I have Victoria,

3:
Just like a solo Victoria.

5:
Solo Victoria. Is she the first? Yeah. and I have Alexis, my manager.

3:
Just, god forbid crisis happens as it's happening here today on,

5:
And then it was just Alexis and Victoria. But I was, me and my friend Devon were out drinking and she has like a hundred pinned and I was like, why isn't my pinned? And she was like, well you don't have mine pinned. So then we pinned each other's. You know what's weird about pinning is it's harder for you to see the message versus when it's in the

3:
Chat. Oh. 'cause like the new one would move up in the chat,

5:
Move up in the chat where the

3:
Others are just like

5:
Stack where it doesn't move. It just like sometimes shows if you have anyone and I overlook it sometimes. Mm. So I actually don't really like the pin. Sorry,

3:
Victoria, missing all your text.

5:
I've got a lot of text. I have 89 texts from just sitting in this podcast.

3:
89 since we've been sitting here.

3:
So far you have no kids.

5:
And I'm also like, what the fuck was I thinking,

3:
Dude? Yeah, like 22, 24.

5:
I'm still, I'm still figuring my shit out. I can barely take care of myself.

3:
How would you rate your head game?

5:
Sex for me is so funny because I feel like people look at me and they have this like idea that I'm like some like sex creature because my body and like, you know, just like, I don't know. And I'm just like really, like, I'm even like more anxiety about sex and I am about social settings. Like I don't like to like just have sex with people. It's not my thing.

3:
You're not fucking everyone in la?

5:
No. Absolutely not.

3:
Not that I think anyone thought that, but I just wanna,

5:
I feel like people think that you

3:
Th

5:
Okay. I definitely think people think that. I just like, fuck everyone. Have you gone on

3:
When you go on dates with guys?

5:
Do you I've been on one date my whole life. I don't know. I have like, I like have such bad anxiety that I'm scared to go on dates.

3:
Like

5:
I'm too scared to go.

3:
So you, when you are just like hook up with a guy, you just are hanging in the house?

5:
It's usually my friends.

3:
Okay. So it's usually like in a, like a hang

5:
Setting. Like in a hang setting. Okay. Oh, okay. Like we're like, it's a friend. Yeah. We're hanging out And like we end up like, you know, being my little flings.

3:
Do you find yourself in those more than dating? Yes. You just kinda like have a situation and then you move on?

5:
Yeah. I like was in a relationship when I was really young and I got cheated on and it was like traumatizing. That was kind of public. Right. and I don't know if it was like public or not. I feel like people think I was the one who, who cheated, but I just got cheated on. and I and I haven't been in a

3:
Relationship since you feel like I haven't been the same since

5:
I've been in like little flings, but I wouldn't call them like, oh I had like a full boyfriend.

3:
Do you want one?

5:
I wouldn't like oppose.

3:
Let's start it right here. Call, Her Daddy. Someone please take this poor girl on a date. We're literally you stop.

5:
Yeah. But then, but then they're gonna ask me on a date and I'm gonna be too nervous to go. Like, I'm gonna be like, I'm sorry, can we hang out with all my friends together? And then maybe after we hang out for the first time with my friends, like, oh my God, I'll tell you who after. But this guy, this guy that I've been crushing on, I DMed him. What did you dm? I didn't DM him. I, I posted a story of like the movie I was watching Right. And tagged him like, and then I hid it

3:
So no one could see. So

5:
No one could see that I tagged him. Wait, that's hold on. So it appeared in his dms pause. That's

3:
Fucking brilliant.

5:
Oh, you hide the tag. I've never like I'm just watching this movie casually hide the tag. It appears in their dms and then he DMed me back and it was like, does he hold on

3:
Blue? Check mark?

5:
Yes, of course. But then he invited me like to Hawaii and I was like, I'm not going to Hawaii to meet you. Please. Like, I don't know you like come meet me at the nice guy or something. Right. And like, you know, nothing ever happened with it because I wouldn't go to 'cause I was too nervous. Can

3:
You give us a musician actor? Sportsman Actor, actor. What? Do you have a type?

5:
I don't have a type. It was,

3:
I, I, if we could keep all this in, I would literally, this would be like the number one show in the world.

5:
Like my dms are insane. I can't

3:
Even imagine.

5:
But like, I don't answer them.

3:
Why?

5:
'cause I don't, I have this thing, I don't like find people attractive or like, I can't, like I downloaded Raya for a second. Like I and I wouldn't hurt anyone so I would just go and I would just look just because I was bored. And like just X, everyone and I don't find people attractive unless I like speak to them in person. And like have a conversation.

3:
I feel the same way. If

5:
We don't vibe and we can't and we can't have a conversation and I feel awkward talking to you, then I'm not gonna like you. But if conversation flows easy and we're like, yeah friends and we can have a conversation, then I start to like you.

3:
Okay. My next question. How are you coming? Like what position during sex is your best way to get off?

5:
It really depends on the person. Mm. I like to be on top 'cause then you can control it

3:
On top front or reversed

5:
Front. Mm. But I also love a good missionary.

3:
Yeah.

5:
With like a pillow under me underrated. I feel like for girls the way that it feels good for girls on top is, is not the way that it feels really good for guys. If that makes sense. Yeah. Like the way that it, the way that a guy wants you to ride isn't how it feels good for us.

3:
Right? Like

5:
It's not the bouncing No.

3:
He wants you to be up

5:
And down just like bouncing up and down and that grind. It's like more like a grind

3:
Because when you're going

5:
Grind up and they don't get that and they're like selfish usually

3:
They're like, come on baby. Like get on your, put your, the bottom of your feet on the mattress. And like squat position and

5:
I amm. Like less of that. My guy. Yeah.

3:
Like this pogo

5:
Stick.

3:
At

5:
This point I'll like turn around, just hit it from the back like leave me alone. I'm not doing all this work for you. If I'm, if I'm doing work, it's for me.

3:
Do you guys usually wanna hit it from behind for the obvious

5:
Hone? Honestly I would. I don't know. Not, it's like, it's never like the first thing but even like, even like not even the first position but like, not even like the first time sometimes with someone, it's not like maybe

3:
They're intimidated like

5:
Yeah like they can't handle it back there.

3:
They're like, I'm gonna look small in there. I'm nervous. Am I big enough? Ah, okay. I love you. Okay. Okay. What is the wildest kink someone has asked you to be a part of in the bedroom?

5:
This is so fucked. My dog. You know that what I give away? Oh no. I had a bark collar for her.

3:
You put it on yourself and I put it

5:
On myself.

3:
There's reasons why this dog left you for your sister. And we are now getting clarified as why

5:
I would, I would take it off and put it on and then he would remote control and control it.

3:
Oh wait. 'cause it can close in on your

5:
And I would like shock the, the back of my neck. Like I would wear it like a collar and then

3:
Wait

5:
This is good. Press the shock button. And like turn it higher. If I was like, we did it hurt, not behaving.

3:
You're like electric fence bitch. Wait, did it hurt? Or it was just like a Ooh.

5:
It was like a ooh. Ooh.

3:
So we're learning something about you

5:
Minute of every

3:
Minute. It's so good. Morning sex or late night sex?

5:
Hmm. Depends on the person.

3:
Like why?

5:
I don't know

3:
Why. I'm not sure.

5:
I honestly like late night better because you like get ready for bed, you like brush your teeth. Morning sex is always like for me, I'm like don't touch me unless I brush my teeth. So if it's right when we wake up, then it's like always a side or like a back. And sometimes I like to

3:
Yeah. Feel you. The side in the morning isn't that bad?

5:
No, it's not bad. I wouldn't say it's bad, but

3:
I would prefer the night for me.

5:
Yeah. Like I like the, you know. Yeah. Embrace each other.

3:
What was that thing you go

5:
I was like, bring it, give it to me.

3:
Have you ever had a guy that like won't make out with you during sex?

5:
Absolutely not.

3:
I had girls write in be like my boyfriend, like won't really like kiss me while we fuck. Do you easily get off from someone going out down on you if they're

5:
Good at it?

3:
I know. Wait, do you know what's so sad? I remember I had Lana Rhodes on and we were talking about when the guy is going down and he's so earnestly like going at it and you're like, oh my God. Like this is so awful. And you're like, okay, just come fuck me. like you

5:
Like yeah. Literally you pull him up.

3:
Yeah. You're like, okay, okay. And you're like transitioned to like, come on. Like yeah. It's so awful when they don't get it. I

5:
Wonder if they know that. And the fact that you've said that, that's like the girls code secret. It's, I'm not good at going down. You, you just pull him

3:
Up. You don't fucking your baby fuck me. Fuck. You're acting like you can't take it anymore. like you like you can't, you want them so bad. But it's like, because

5:
When in reality you're like, I can't do this anymore.

3:
Who is your last missed call and should we call them back right now because it's rude to leave people on. You know, it's

5:
Kylie.

3:
I I was gonna say call him back but you don't need to. Okay.

5:
She called me three times.

3:
There's an emergency. Should you call her back? You're like, no, I can't be like I'm on a podcast.

5:
I'm like I can't. No, it's, I just, she's probably just asking if I'm still going to her house but I'm just gonna meet her there.

3:
You're gonna show up so drunk. I know. I'm going out.

5:
I'm going after.

3:
Okay. Two more. Deep ones

5:
Deep.

3:
Yeah. Okay. What are you insecure about?

5:
I don't know. A lot. Some days. Some days nothing.

3:
Okay.

5:
It depends on the day, honestly. I don't saying that a lot. But on the

3:
Day that you're feeling a little insecure, lot

5:
Women

3:
Are listening, be relatable, sy everything.

5:
Body, face, fucking anything. The way I speak. Like some days I'll be insecure about like my fucking feet. Or some days I'll be like, oh I hate my fucking tattoos. I don't wanna show them. Or I'm feeling fat or like whatever it is. Like I feel like we pick at each at ourselves so much that I try and just like, you know, not to let it get to me. But there's definitely days where I'm like, wow, I fucking hate myself. Like I just wanna lay in bed cry.

3:
What's something that nobody on the internet knows about you but like your close friends know about you?

5:
I mean I feel like just like everyone thinks that, you know, I came from this like rich family And. like I'm like a stuck up little bitch who like has had everything handed to her in life And that's not the case. Like I had to work for what I have And like yeah I had an advantage and I'll never like think that I didn't, but I've worked hard to like take care of me and my family and other people around me.

3:
You've had a lot of like ties to people because you have friends that are famous. People probably want all this information from you. And how do you like staying loyal to the people in your life without compromising who you are and in moments of chaos, And like the tabloids. Like I'm sure people are like STAs. Do you like have the T? Do you know like how do you

5:
I feel like the people that I'm closest to who would like ask me questions about other people that they know I would know wouldn't even ask me because they have enough respect for me to like not put me in that position. Damn. So that's what I love about like my friend group and you know if something's getting written in the tabloids, they're not gonna be like, oh STAs is this true or not? Like they know that like I'm not gonna tell them or I would be like, oh I don't know. Or whatever it is the it. I've never had really an awkward moment except for like once when I would just be like, oh, I don't know. I don't know yet. From my understanding I don't know.

5:
But they just, you know, I think they respect me enough to like not ask me that. and I've never had any randoms like, or not random so like acquaintances even feel comfortable enough to ask me questions about other people. That's kind of

3:
Dope. You're kind of that like ride or die chick that like you're keeping

5:
I just wanna protect everyone. Yeah.

3:
I remember following you on social media so long ago And like not having really much about you other than like she's a really hot chick and she looks like she's got a cool life. So it's cool to sit down with you and I know you don't do interviews and I appreciate you sitting down with me 'cause it gives like more insight into who you are. Your background without getting too deep and just like chilling with you and talking with you has been fun. So I appreciate

5:
You. It's been so fun. I appreciate you my first and only interview so don't ask me again. Do another one.

3:
You're like I'm never coming back on goodbye. No,

5:
I'll come on. I'll come on. Call. Her Daddy. Anytime you want me to. This is the best thing ever. I had so much fun. Fun. I mean like fun, tipsy, having fun talking to like a friend. So fun. It's not scary. When I do an interview I get so scared because I feel like they want me to fuck up something. And like say something fucked and try And like trip your words up. That's not the goal. We're just trying to have fun and cheer. We're trying to have fun and drink some sunny. Cheers bitch. I love you. I feel right already. Love, love you. Fuck. I have one sip left.
