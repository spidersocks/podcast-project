1:
Greenwood. I lived here half my life. Everyone knows everyone and their business. I have decided to set the story straight. It's still surreal. I still think maybe I'll wake up. We were out for my birthday. I remember I was just sitting at the bar and he sat down beside me and we just talked the rest of the night.

3:
You were there the night she met Davis.

4:
I was. I was there that night.

3:
Did it seem like there was chemistry or

4:
Enough bed? Immediately I would immediately

1:
Davis, he was so kind and I and his heart was huge. We enjoyed each other so much. It was an amazing six months.

4:
Meredith, her and Davis, they would go on away weekends a lot. I liked him. His smile was so contagious and he's just such a sweet guy. I would've never expected this to happen ever.

5:
Greenwood County 9 1 1. What is the one person car wreck? Okay, it was a car wreck and somebody is hurt.

4:
I pull up right beside Davis's car and he wasn't in his car and that's when I noticed his airbags were out. So then also that's when I kind of started looking at the car more and noticed that his front tire was smashed in and I remember looking and I noticed there's a body. Meredith just started like screaming like Who is it? Who is it?

3:
And you look over, what do you think you were looking at

1:
Davis.

4:
He was laying there and his head was rested on the side like a pillow and he was shirtless and his face was covered in blood.

3:
Was there anything about the scene that struck you as

1:
Odd Davis being all the way on the other side of the road, the car being wrecked, like none of that. I couldn't piece anything together.

4:
Davis' car was way over there and his body was way down here and I was like, well how'd he end up down here?

3:
It's quite a distance. Yeah, to hear

4:
It is quite a distance.

6:
Originally it came out as a, as a possible traffic accident. And then once officers arrived on scene, they realized it was more than that.

7:
A lot of people think it was an auto accident. Well no it wasn't.

8:
I do believe that this was an accident and not an intentional killing.

7:
It was

9:
A murder.

4:
I was in shock. I was like, it doesn't even make sense.

6:
The photographs of the crime scene, the text messages from Davis' phone, the ring videos looking at everything and the totality of the case was very powerful.

10:
How could many of this possibly happen?

1:
There's so many things missing from the story and once I kind of get that out there, then I can close the chapter.

13:
Anne Marie Green reports The Hit and Run Homicide of Davis McClendon,

3:
Charlotte

14:
Romeo 9 7 4 and 10 28 Whiskey Echo Victor 2 5 3.

3:
It was May 7th, 2023 just after 1:00 AM when authorities responded to a reported road accident on a secluded dead end street in Greenwood, South Carolina.

14:
Start roping this off 'cause this is gonna be a crime scene.

3:
At the edge of the nearby woods, they would find 46-year-old Davis McClendon's body. But what they saw at first was on the road itself, a shirt, a shoe, and a mangled sedan

9:
And there was significant damage to the offender.

3:
It was a BMW five series similar to this one we're using to demonstrate the position of the vehicle that night after first responders had locked everything down, Greenwood County Sheriff's Office investigator Patrick Durkin arrived to photograph the scene.

9:
The front driver's side wheel was turned slightly.

3:
Whatever had transpired at this deserted crossroads Durkin's job was to freeze it in time. First responders had thought Davis McClendon's injuries seemed consistent with having being hit by a vehicle, though no other vehicle relating to the collision was there. They'd found Davis' body about 50 feet away from the BMW leading them to suspect he'd been outside his car when he was hit.

9:
There was no rain or anything that would potentially wash anything away. So the main thing I focused on was the vehicle.

3:
Durkin says he noticed some strange damage to the BMW.

9:
Usually when we would, you'd think of a normal fender bender, it would just kind of be pressed into it and this was torn back like a tuna can. In a sense.

3:
It had made authorities wonder if it was a hit and run or something more sinister. Those airbags were out and a phone was on the front passenger seat. Durkin saw more debris in the road, but nothing particularly telling

6:
The assumption was that he was struck by a vehicle

3:
Investigator Ronnie Powell from the Greenwood County Sheriff's Office says authorities had learned more by speaking to two women at the scene. Meredith Haney and Megan McGovern who'd called 9 1 1. Megan often babysat for Meredith's three children.

6:
They provided statements of what they saw and what had occurred all night long.

3:
What did Meredith say?

6:
She pretty much gave a summary of the whole backstory that she had been dating Davis.

3:
Meredith had told authorities that Davis left a club they'd been in that night calling her minutes later from the road saying he was parked at the intersection of Avid Road and Sawgrass Place when he'd put her on hold and then failed to come back on the line. Meredith was worried and got a ride there from Meghan. It was Meghan, the babysitter who'd gotten out of her car and was the first to see Davis's body. That news must have been stunning. Yeah,

15:
It was devastating. It was. It was crushing.

3:
Davis McClendon was the ultimate people person without an enemy in the world. Say his friends chip funder bunk. Everybody

15:
Loved Davis. He was just awesome

10:
Said earlier.

3:
He was Zach Calhoun.

10:
He he, he loved big

3:
And Johnny Coates

16:
And what Zach said, he was everyone's best friend. He was, he loved everyone,

3:
But none of them could remember Davis ever mentioning the specifics of his love life. Not until he met Meredith Haney.

10:
He told me that he had met somebody and they had just kind of been chatting and you know, enjoying getting to know each other. You know, it seemed, seemed like a good thing. Seemed like a positive thing for sure.

3:
Calhoun says Davis had gone through a divorce but the end of his marriage hadn't done anything to weaken his devotion as a father and a friend, even to the residence of the retirement home where he worked.

1:
He was the most empathetic person I've ever met.

3:
More than four months before Davis died on the night of December 23rd, 2022. Meredith was at that club celebrating her 39th birthday with her best friends. She says they were wearing their worst Christmas sweaters when the handsome stranger struck up a conversation

1:
Then I think he text on Christmas day and then the next day and then the next and

3:
You just kept on talking until meeting Davis. She says she'd been keeping her head down just about six months earlier. She had left her husband of 10 years a local auto body shop owner named Bud Ackerman and she was struggling to balance parenting their three kids and her job as a grammar school teacher. She says she knew getting involved with someone new would not be easy. Was there any hesitancy about moving forward with this

1:
There? I mean there was,

3:
She says first Davis wanted to make sure she had no intention of reconciling her marriage.

1:
He didn't wanna be the reason that, you know, we didn't get our family back together. So we made sure from the get go that that wasn't gonna be an issue and I just, it just happened

3:
They would have less than six months together.

2:
Could

3:
You start to guess what may have happened, how it was hit the night of Davis's death at the site? Investigator Patrick Durkin noticed something beyond the strangeness of the crashed car and Davis's distance from it. There was an oil slick in the road. It's still here

9:
Just over a year later it's, it's still here. But there was a number of footprints and, and some tire tracks that were leading away from this oil stand.

3:
And what did that tell you when you saw it?

9:
Well we knew that there was some type of impact to the vehicle and then we knew there was oil and and tire marks that left from here.

3:
It looked like evidence from the vehicle that hit Davis. You guys are looking around and you realize the oil continues.

9:
You could see it was very obvious that there was tire marks that had had gone back down the road and kind of turned around

3:
Back where the tire tracks seemed to show a vehicle had turned around, investigators had found oil spatters on a streetlight post.

9:
It was about maybe this high

3:
And from there there was a trail of oil that had led down the road into the distance. It's brake comes

9:
Basically and matter speaking,

6:
You know, we just have to do the investigation and and see what evidence is there and see where it leads us to

Listen to one of Apple's favorite podcasts of 2024 By searching for throughline on Apple Podcasts or on your favorite podcast app.

6:
There was a trail that led from from the incident location

3:
Investigator Ronnie Powell says By the time authority started following that oil trail from the crash site, they had a solid hunch where it might lead. Davis McClendon's girlfriend Meredith Haney had told them she'd suspected where he had been going when he left her at the bar that night to meet her estranged husband. But Ackerman and it turns out the oily evidence led right to Ackerman's parents' house

14:
Garage is open.

3:
He'd been living there since separating from Meredith about a year earlier. Sheriff's

14:
Office? Yes sir.

3:
Authorities body cameras were rolling.

6:
He Kawana walked up and almost was expecting us.

3:
Yes sir. But Ackerman and his father were both standing near the garage.

14:
Are there's some kids here? Yeah. Yep. Okay. Whose kids are they? Mine. Yours and who? My wife. Okay.

3:
Bud had spent the day with his three kids at a local festival. He and his wife Meredith had a custody arrangement and it was his night with the kids. But in the driveway, authorities noticed his white Ford F two 50 pickup. That's

14:
That's wild.

3:
Yeah, that with oil leaking from the undercarriage, they also noticed a crack in the grill and other evidence that suggested the vehicle had hit someone

14:
That's a Palm mark.

3:
Investigators turned to Bud. Do

14:
You have your ID on you? I do not. Okay, just step over here for me.

3:
Authorities say Bud told them he would not answer questions without his lawyer present. But from speaking with Meredith, they learned she had a contentious relationship with her soon to be ex-husband and came to suspect a jealous bud. Ackerman had mowed Davis McClendon down. Looking at the scene, they deduced Davis had been standing outside his BMW as shown in this CBS news animation. Based on their investigation, they suspect bud's pickup truck, sideswiped the sedan and hit Davis carrying him on the vehicle's grill and depositing his body across the road.

3:
Meredith says Bud had been upset since reaching out to her days earlier when he found out she was dating Davis.

1:
He text me.

3:
What did he text you?

1:
He said something about Meredith. How could you,

3:
What was your reaction

1:
To that text? I think it was hurt like I was, I felt bad because I just don't like to hurt people's people. I don't like people to be hurt. So I felt bad.

3:
What had begun years earlier as a promising marriage that would bear three kids had fallen apart.

1:
He was a good father, he was a really good dad.

3:
Bud was from a prominent local family and he was a business owner. But Meredith says his work had become stressful.

1:
I started to notice like some depression and things like that that I've never seen before.

3:
She says he started drinking a lot and the more he drank, she says the more unpredictable he became

1:
There was screaming cussing.

3:
You felt threatened?

1:
Absolutely.

3:
Meredith says he never laid a hand on her but destroyed her sense of self.

1:
The house was never clean enough. There were never enough groceries. It was so loud and vulgar. It was very degrading.

3:
Then she says she noticed her husband was starting to become paranoid. She remembers being in her closet one day and noticing a strange pillow.

1:
He'd cut a hole in it.

3:
According to Meredith, there was a hidden camera inside

1:
And then I started finding more of 'em.

3:
What other places did you find cameras?

1:
Oh, there was one hidden in our dresser that faced the bed, found one in a bush in the front yard and he put 'em in all the kids' rooms.

3:
She says that was the last straw. They separated in the spring of 2022.

1:
I could breathe, I could be me again.

3:
Meredith says the separation seemed to help bud too, that he'd stopped drinking and kept going to church with her and the kids. But by then she decided it was too late.

1:
When I was done, I was done.

3:
And starting again with someone new seemed like a distant dream. Meredith says. Until that night, Davis McClendon sauntered up and sat down in her life. They tried to keep things low key. At first. Meredith says she never wanted to rub Bud's nose in it. So what did you all do?

1:
We would go out of town,

3:
But Meredith says they knew they couldn't sneak around forever and it had started seeming like her new relationship with Davis was a forever kind of thing.

1:
We talked about sitting on the porch, rocking chairs at AD and it was just a different kind of relationship.

3:
But after Bud found out there were new complications,

1:
He accused you of cheating. Yeah.

3:
Even though you were weeks away from

1:
Your divorce. Right.

3:
Meredith says, bud actually called Davis and asked him to back off until the divorce was official. What was Davis' reaction to that request?

1:
I think he agreed, but then we talked about it and decided that was just giving him another

3:
Little piece of control. And on the night Davis died, she says Bud seemed out of control back at his parents' house. Investigators now had a warrant and were finding more clues that Ackerman had been at the crash site.

17:
Oily footprints. Oily footprints

3:
At about 6:30 AM on May 7th, 2023. But Ackerman was arrested. He would be charged with the murder of Davis McLendon.

6:
We think there's enough evidence at the scene to to prove of what occurred.

3:
So by the end of the night, you already have someone in custody? Yes. What's left to do?

6:
Well that's just the beginning

3:
Because it turns out Bud Ackerman did have a story to tell. He says Davis was standing near the middle of a dark road approximately shown in this CBS news animation. Bud says he didn't see Davis until it was too late that hitting him had been an accident. And Bud's team says they can prove it.

3:
Investigators are confident they could prove, but Ackerman's truck had hit and killed Davis McLendon but they knew proving Ackerman had done it on purpose might be harder.

6:
Building a case starts from that night.

3:
And when investigators looked at that night, they learned Bud Ackerman had been tracking Davis and Meredith's whereabouts for hours.

6:
He was trying to find them that night and he was was not happy about this whole situation.

3:
Using security video, phone records, and even data from Bud's own truck, authorities built a timeline. They began with Meredith's phone, Lieutenant Matthew Womack of the Greenwood County Sheriff's Office.

6:
We were able to extract the information such as the calls and the texts,

3:
A slew of calls and text messages Bud had made to Meredith leading up to the collision at 8:54 PM Bud Texts Meredith, why do you hate me? I just don't understand. She doesn't respond to him. She's out with Davis at a local restaurant. We went

1:
To dinner at Break on the Lake,

6:
Uc, Davis and Meredith. You know, having dinner

3:
And being interrupted by Bud's attempts to reach her. What was the FaceTime conversation like? Where

1:
Are you? Who are you with? Why are you doing this to me?

3:
Did you tell him where you were?

1:
I feel like it at some point in the conversation, either he could tell where I was because of what's around me or I finally did tell him was one or the other.

3:
So at that point he knows that you're out with Davis. While Meredith continued her date with Davis security cameras catch Bud Ackerman at 10:40 PM arriving at a popular Greenwood Club called Key West.

6:
You could see Bud, you know he's talking to people, interacting, consuming alcohol.

3:
The video shows Bud spent about an hour and a half at Key West, then called Meredith again. How did he sound on the phone?

1:
Intoxicated.

3:
What's an intoxicated bud sound like

1:
Vulgar.

3:
Soon after midnight, Ackerman had left Key West. About a half hour later cameras show Bud's truck circling in front of Break on the lake. But by then Meredith and Davis were no longer at the restaurant.

6:
You can see his vehicle drive through the parking lot. It's if he's looking for him,

3:
Lieutenant Womack says, before long investigators would learn just how far Bud Ackerman had gone that night To find Meredith and Davis though Ackerman himself wasn't talking critical information would emerge from another digital witness. His truck,

6:
It's a box about this big that goes into the backside of the dash.

3:
Womac says in some cars and trucks, the infotainment systems as they're known store detailed information about how the vehicles are being driven. We are in a similar model to Bud's Ford F two 50 pickup.

6:
So on Bud's vehicle, they were able to pull a significant amount of information. This is just a little snippet, you're talking just in, in a 24 hour time period, it's over 3000 events.

3:
Events including snap measurements of speed, acceleration and break pressure bud's onboard, computer, even pinged public wifi. As it passed, investigators learned that Bud had actually driven by Meredith's house and onto Davis McClendon Street that night. But while he was driving around looking for them, ironically they had moved to the Key West Club. He had just left.

1:
When Davis decides to call Bud, he walked out the back of the bar.

3:
It was 12:51 AM

1:
A few minutes passed and I went out there to check on him and he was gone.

3:
Did he think he could bring the temperature down? Records show Davis called her minutes later And what was that conversation?

1:
Where are you?

3:
And that's when he told me that he was going to meet Bud Womack says Other infotainment system data show that at a bit past one in the morning, Davison Bud had their fatal encounter

6:
And we can tell there was actually an event at 1:11 AM on May the seventh.

3:
They say Ackerman hit the brakes hard.

6:
We could narrow it down to tenths of seconds of when the collision occurred.

3:
And according to the computer, seconds after the collision, Ackerman's truck had stopped

6:
At that point in time, Bud's opening the door, he opens the door before he shifts it to Park.

3:
Womack thinks Ackerman got out of his truck, which was probably leaking from the collision. Remember that puddle of oil in the road near the victim.

6:
Then he closes the door, then he gets back in and then it's shifted to drive. At that point in time

3:
Then say authorities Ackerman turns his truck around near the lamppost roughly as you see in this CBS news demonstration. Based on their investigation, he then drives away leaking an oil trail all the way to his parents' driveway

6:
Right here. His phone becomes unavailable. The ignition turned off and it disconnected from his device. What does

3:
That tell you?

6:
That's when he got home and got out. It started to paint a very clear picture,

3:
But Ackerman's attorney Jack swirling paints a different picture.

8:
I don't think he intended to run Davis McClendon over. There's no indication that he's an aggressive or violent individual.

14:
Sheriff's office.

3:
Yes sir. Nor says swirling is there much to indicate his client was drunk that night. Lemme you this. Can

14:
I get you to step with me over here for me please?

3:
Alright. None of the cops who were arrested him reported he seemed tipsy.

8:
The only one that said he was intoxicated was Meredith.

3:
Was he stalking them that night?

8:
I think he was trying to find out, confirm that they were together. He wanted to talk to her.

3:
According to swirling, Meredith and Davis had betrayed McClendon's promise to Bud to stand down until the Ackerman's marriage was officially over.

8:
She couldn't wait another month. And she's out with this guy and she's cheating on her husband. They are still legally married. South Carolina law calls out adultery

3:
And swirling says the Knight. Davis died. He led, but Ackerman's repeated calls and text messages to Meredith get under his skin.

8:
Davis got upset about it and that's what led to them having this meeting. Buds thought they were gonna meet and talk.

3:
He says, bud had suggested an innocent and safe place for it to happen.

8:
They were supposed to meet at Bud's parents' house, which is about a half a mile from that location.

3:
Swirling says Ackerman's children were sleeping there that night. So attacking Davis would've been the last thing on his client's mind.

8:
You wouldn't meet at your parents' house if you were angry and threatening and ready to kill somebody.

3:
He says it was Davis who selected the deserted intersection as a new location and remember how Davis was found without his shirt on that night. Well, swirling says he believes Davis took it off to prepare for a confrontation.

8:
He was ready to fight.

3:
Swirling insists Bud Ackerman meant no harm that night. And Bud is about to tell that story to a jury.

8:
Your name

18:
William Gray Ackerman Jr. Also go by Bud.

20:
Good morning everybody. We are on the record in the state versus William Bud Ackerman.

3:
Prosecutors are determined to prove it was no accident that Bud Ackerman hit Davis McClendon the night he died. So in September of 2024, assistant Attorneys General John Conrad and John Mets, he

7:
Intentionally drove his car into the body of Davis McLendon

3:
Start the case off with a bang. Bam.

7:
And that's what this case is about.

3:
They'll argue Ackerman couldn't stand the fact that his estranged wife was seeing someone and Bud was searching for Meredith and Davis all over town.

7:
But Ackerman was not going to let Davis McClendon be with Meredith. That's your house right there. Yes

3:
Sir. Meadows and Conrad lead with their strongest evidence. There are actually timestamp videos from the neighbor's doorbell cameras at the moment of the crash that killed Davis. It shows what they say is Bud's Ford F two 50 driving through the frame seconds later on the video, what sounds like a crash and seconds after that a series of muffled sounds.

7:
What did you hear? I heard somebody yelling. Okay,

3:
Prosecutors argue it's Bud Ackerman's voice yelling at Davis McLendon after running him down.

1:
What it sounded like to me was, what do you wanna talk about now?

7:
Bud's yelling un heavenly expletive. He said to Davis as he was lying on the ground. I think he was glad he was dead.

3:
But Bud Ackerman's defense attorney Jack swirling, argues the audio is too garbled to prove anything. I've

8:
Listened to it several times now and well, I don't believe you could conclude a hundred percent that that exactly what he said.

3:
The prosecutor then calls Megan McGovern the Ackerman's babysitter and friend to describe the moment she'd seen Davis's body through traumatized teenage eyes.

4:
He had blood coming out of his ears and his nose and I couldn't, I'm not exactly sure if it was coming out of his mouth or not. 'cause I mean there's just blood everywhere from his nose and everything.

3:
But their star witness is the woman at the center of both men's affection. Meredith Haney who testifies with the date night security videos as a guide.

4:
Yes sir.

7:
Is that you?

1:
Yes, sir.

3:
She tells the jury Bud Ackerman called her when she and Davis were at Break on the Lake.

7:
Did you think he was trying to find you?

1:
I did worry, yes.

3:
And kept calling after they got to Key West Club,

7:
Got a call from the defendant, bud Ackerman?

1:
Yes sir.

7:
Did you reject that call? Yes. It's 18 seconds later you get another call. Yes

1:
Sir.

7:
Well, what'd you think about all these calls coming in?

1:
I was getting very frustrated and angry and just, it was getting obsessive. It was getting scary.

3:
And she says by the time Davis McClendon left her at the Key West Club after midnight, and is

7:
That Davis McClendon leaving the bar?

1:
Yes.

3:
She was worried Bud might be volatile. So when Davis later called to tell her he was going to meet with Ackerman, she says she wanted to go check on the situation in person and makes clear to the jury that when she saw the scene, she had little doubt who killed her boyfriend.

1:
I dove back into Me's car because I thought that the only way that Bud would've ever killed somebody would've been to shoot. Objection.

7:
Objection. Don't, don't

3:
Go. The judge sustains the defense's Objection, but Meredith continues.

1:
I was scared that he was still out there.

20:
Okay, Mr. Swirling, any cross-examination? All right, go question. Can I step down ma'am?

21:
Your Honor, the state call special agent Brian Hudak,

3:
Digital forensics expert, Brian Hudak, tells the jury about data in the infotainment system of Ackerman's pickup, including some that show Bud was driving in exactly the right place in

22:
Greenwood at the intersection of David and Sawgrass

3:
At exactly the right time between

22:
1 11 31 and 1 11 32

3:
To be implicated in the deadly collision. He suggests they can even tell the moment of impact.

21:
There's something that causes this truck to decelerate very quickly. Correct?

22:
Correct.

3:
And Huac says the evidence shows Ackerman was going 25 miles per hour

21:
And the amount of detail that that truck had on what Bud did that night is, is simply breathtaking

23:
Ford vehicles on the completely on the wrong side of the road when it strikes the BMW

3:
Back collision reconstruction expert Corporal Christopher Cher testifies the Dent Show buds speeding pickup sideswiped Davis's BMW Sedan as shown in that CBS news animation based on the prosecution's theory. They say Bud was aiming at Davis who was standing near the driver's door when he was hit, and that the truck kept going with Davis on the grill until he fell off where authorities found him. But Jack swirling argues much of the same evidence shows hitting Davis was an accident.

8:
We maintain that Mr. Ackerman did not act intentionally in this case.

3:
He says, but Ackerman had no idea Davis was standing outside his car and calls auto forensics expert Jonathan Nelson to testify that given Ackerman's speed in the dark over a slope in the road and into the parked BMW's headlight beams, he wouldn't have seen Davis McClendon standing in the road until at most two and a half seconds before the collision.

8:
Or would a person have sufficient opportunity to avoid impact?

24:
I think most people would've little to no opportunity to begin to try to avoid.

3:
And swirling says Davis wasn't standing right next to his car when he was hit, but further out towards the center of the road and that Ackerman swerved to his left, into the BMW to get around him as shown in this CBS news animation based on the defense's theory,

8:
He's trying to avoid hitting him.

3:
Wouldn't you swerve the other way

8:
Why he didn't go right? I can't answer that.

3:
Swirling knows there may be only one person who can

8:
Call Bud Ackerman. Alright, come around to

3:
Stand please. Sir. Ackerman's attorney begins by trying to show the jury his client was Meredith's long suffering but devoted husband.

8:
Did you love her?

18:
I did very much.

3:
He admits he was angry at Meredith, but says he only wanted to talk to her and agreed to meet Davis to talk to him too.

8:
Do you have any intention to hurt him?

18:
I did not.

3:
Ackerman says he hadn't realized how fast he was going and that he was only trying to pull up next to Davis to talk and didn't see McClendon standing in the road until the last moment.

8:
What action did you take, if any, to avoid hitting the person?

18:
I jerked my truck as hard as I could to the left to try to hit his car to stop the motion of my truck from going forward.

3:
But on cross-examination, he admits something that undercuts his claims of innocence that night. He had never called 9 1 1.

8:
I panicked. You

18:
Panicked.

3:
Instead, he left the scene and drove to his parents' house and told them what had happened, but they never called authorities either.

8:
I've seen so many people react in abnormal ways in all the cases I've handled that I've come to expect those kind of things

3:
In closings, prosecutor Mets argues Ackerman is a murderer with a truck as his weapon.

7:
This might as well be a drive-by shooting with a gun.

3:
Andy says, the Ford pickups infotainment system proves it.

7:
This is Bud Frank. This is malice. This is intent.

8:
That state has not proven that Mr. Ackerman acted with malice or the intent.

3:
It's the highest possible bar and the defense insists the state has not proven its case.

8:
Mr. Ackerman is entitled to a verdict of not guilty.

7:
This is judgment day. This verdict day.

8:
You never know what a jury's gonna do. You got 12 people making the decision.

20:
Have you reached a verdict in this case? Ladies and gentlemen, it's my understanding that the jury has reached a a verdict

3:
For the Ackerman jury. Six days of testimony and evidence boil down to a deliberation less than a half hour long

25:
Sight of South Carolina versus William Gray. Bud Ackerman,

3:
Did you have a feeling about what that verdict might be?

8:
Yes. Yeah, a quick verdict like that is not good. Not good.

25:
We the jury unanimously find the defendant guilty. Signed

3:
Bud Ackerman is guilty of the murder of Davis McLendon.

7:
It was the right verdict.

3:
I mean, I I thought it would be fast.

2:
Not that fast.

3:
Not just fast, but too fast to be thought through. Says, but Ackerman's attorney Jack swirling,

8:
I don't think the jury considered everything that was presented to him.

15:
They didn't need a lot of time to stew over the evidence. The evidence was clear and obvious

3:
Damning evidence of what Bud Ackerman did say. Davis McClendon's friends and equally damning evidence they say of what Bud Ackerman never did.

10:
Our friend laid there in the road.

3:
They still can't wrap their head around. Why Nobody in the Ackerman family ever called 9 1 1.

10:
Somebody should have done the right thing

3:
At sentencing right after the verdict. Davis McClendon's son demands accountability from the ackerman's.

2:
It is

26:
Time for this spoiled evil individual and this spoiled evil family in Greenwood to finally gain some repercussions for their actions. Thank you.

27:
Lot's been said about why we didn't call 9 1 1.

3:
But Ackerman's father tries to explain his own lack of action by saying he was too disoriented to know what to do at that hour of the night when his son woke him with the news. The judge's sentence is devastating to the defendant.

20:
Mr. Ackerman, if you please answer sentence of court is Mr. Ackerman, you be committed to State Department corrections period of 45 years.

3:
It looks like the end of the road for Bud Ackerman.

1:
I know that where he is is where he is supposed to be,

3:
But it may allow for a new beginning. For Meredith Haney,

1:
I was worried that if he only got five or 10 years that I'd never get to start a new life because I'd be scared for when he got out

3:
With their father. Unlikely to get out of prison for decades. She's determined to spare her children from the impact of that horrible night. As a single mom, she leans on friends and family.

2:
How

3:
Are the kids doing?

1:
We'll, my kids through

3:
Looking back, she believes Bud Ackerman really wanted to target her that night and that she's only alive because he found Davis McClendon first.

1:
Davis saved my life. You really feel that way? Absolutely.

3:
If true, Meredith Haney owes her life, however challenging to the new man she had once hoped to share it with, how
