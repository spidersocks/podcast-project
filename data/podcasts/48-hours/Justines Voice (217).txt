1 (9s):
Auburn, California above the fog and below the snow, the perfect place. Rural steep cliffs, wooded areas, dirt roads. There are a lot of places to bury a body

0 (32s):
For a hunt, for job. What

2 (37s):
Were you doing that brought you here in 2003?

3 (41s):
I was conditioning a horse to do endurance those Labor Day weekend Saturday, that I came up on a my, just my normal training ride, right about here. Yeah. I saw a freshly dug hole in the brush, the rest of my ride. I kept trying to justify why it was there. It sort of haunted you, it sounds like. It did. It did.

4 (1m 9s):
We had just come home from our summer house up in the Sierras. I barbecued

5 (1m 15s):
At dinner where Donna Lynette Vander shoot their daughter, Justine and her boyfriend Danny. No one had any idea what nightmare was about to unfold. After that meal,

6 (1m 26s):
I gave her a kiss on forehead, said, goodnight, I love you.

0 (1m 29s):
I spoke to her on the phone. I told her I loved her.

6 (1m 35s):
I was leaving for work at 5, 5 30 in the morning.

5 (1m 38s):
Lynette walks into Justine's room. Justine is not there. The dog is on the bed. The front door is open and her car is gone.

1 (1m 47s):
17 years old, disappears, leaves everything behind without trace. It felt sinister.

4 (1m 56s):
We're gonna find her. We searched and searched everywhere.

1 (1m 60s):
There were searches that the Bander shoots organized, and then there were searches that we did on our own with our search and rescue teams.

0 (2m 8s):
We

7 (2m 8s):
Try to imagine what it was like and what it's gonna be like when she comes back.

1 (2m 13s):
Danny and his roommate Brandon, were on the sheriff's radar. Quickly,

8 (2m 18s):
Friends started to come forward about how jealous Danny was of Justine.

1 (2m 22s):
They were interviewed that first day. They said, oh no, we were home all night. There's a belief right away that they are concealing something about Justine's disappearance.

9 (2m 34s):
Okay, have a seat. Have you ever seen anyone die, Brandon?

1 (2m 41s):
Tone changes, story changes. He confesses. Brandon

5 (2m 46s):
Claims that Danny killed Justine. She's

9 (2m 49s):
Laying down and he's over. Her and his hands were not released, but she

8 (2m 53s):
Was. He explained that Danny was choking her and that he helped bury her.

9 (2m 58s):
Let's go

5 (2m 59s):
At the, the end of the interview. Brandon led the investigators to the location of Justine's body.

10 (3m 4s):
Justine Vander shoot's body discovered, buried in a shallow grave.

3 (3m 8s):
The Auburn Journal had a photo of just the brush where Justine had been buried, and I went, oh my gosh. I saw freshly dug hole three days prior to her disappearance. I immediately, you know, contacted the sheriff's department.

1 (3m 21s):
That was a big piece of evidence. That's absolutely cold-blooded, premeditated.

2 (3m 29s):
The Vander Schu family says they are relieved.

5 (3m 32s):
The decision was made to accept pleas to murder from both defendants and give them a life sentence.

4 (3m 38s):
Hopefully we can all move on from here.

5 (3m 40s):
No one would've ever imagined that 20 years later we would still be fighting for justice for Justine and her family. In 2020, Brandon Fernandez filed a petition to get out of his murder conviction. If Brandon's petition is granted, one of Justine's killers will walk free.

11 (3m 56s):
We're fighting for her. That's why we're here. She doesn't have a voice, so we're her voice.

6 (4m 12s):
It's 21 years since we've lost Justine, but it's still very fresh in our mind.

2 (4m 19s):
It was September 18th, 2003 when Justine van Deshoot's remains were discovered in a remote location more than two weeks after she disappeared, but it's here in this garden outside her bedroom window that her parents, Dawn and Lynette, still come to find her.

6 (4m 39s):
This is actually Justine's little,

5 (4m 41s):
Little

6 (4m 41s):
Footprint. Footprint there.

2 (4m 43s):
Mementos of their youngest child and condolence flowers that poured in after her death are now permanently rooted here.

6 (4m 51s):
We call this Justine's Garden

2 (4m 54s):
At the center, a towering dogwood tree. A reminder of her favorite trips to the Sierra Mountains and a sobering measure of how long she's been gone.

6 (5m 5s):
When we celebrated the 17th anniversary, Christine said she's been gone as long as she was here on earth.

2 (5m 12s):
Justine's older sister Christine sums up what those years have been like for her in one word,

11 (5m 18s):
Lonely. She was my best friend. We were only 18 months apart. We did pretty much everything together since day one.

2 (5m 26s):
How would you describe Justine? What was her personality?

11 (5m 29s):
Vibrant, charismatic, just life of the party. She made you laugh every time she'd say something.

4 (5m 38s):
She was a spark in our household, that's for sure.

6 (5m 40s):
Little firecracker, cheerleader, baseball, soccer. She was always on the go.

2 (5m 46s):
At 17, Justine was on the verge of graduating high school and wanted to pursue a career in fashion and beauty. Did she know what she wanted to do in life? After high school?

11 (5m 58s):
She would sew and design her own shirts and shoes. She had to stand out and that was what she wanted to do for other people was make 'em stand out and feel beautiful.

2 (6m 8s):
Instead, her family is now forced to grapple with her murder and it's aftermath.

4 (6m 13s):
I don't ever wanna forget about her, but I don't wanna be reminded of what happened,

2 (6m 17s):
But it's not so easy to just pack it up and put it away, right?

4 (6m 21s):
No, it's not.

2 (6m 23s):
In fact, the Vander Schutt say it remains an open wound. Thanks to ongoing efforts by Justine's convicted murderers, Danny Bessemer and Brandon Fernandez to get out of prison. Retired Placer County Sheriff Ed Bonner,

1 (6m 39s):
Including parole hearings. I think the Vander Schutt have been back to court seven times since the last seven years. Always facing the possibility.

2 (6m 47s):
It's hard to imagine that both men were once welcome in the family's home. First came, Brandon,

11 (6m 54s):
I believe it was probably seventh or eighth grade that I started to become friends with him.

2 (6m 59s):
A few years later, he introduced the Vander shoots to his friend Danny.

11 (7m 3s):
It was actually at a birthday party for me. We had a pool party and Danny was actually coming to the house to meet me,

2 (7m 10s):
But it was Danny and Justine who clicked, and while she was only 15 and he was about 17, they quickly became serious.

11 (7m 19s):
From that party on, they were always, always together.

2 (7m 22s):
They even talked about perhaps getting married. Is that right?

11 (7m 25s):
Yeah, they were very serious. He became kind of like a fixture in her family. His dad wasn't really in the picture and he didn't really have a mom, so to come into our household and see how a real family was, I think that was something that he was attracted to as well.

2 (7m 41s):
The Vander Schuttes offered Danny the support and stability of a happy family life.

11 (7m 47s):
I considered him like a brother almost.

2 (7m 49s):
Dawn, even got Danny, his first real job working with him at an auto dealership and his own key to the house, but looking back, the Vander Schuttes now see red flags. They didn't recognize. Then

4 (8m 2s):
Controlling,

11 (8m 3s):
Telling her who she could see and who she couldn't monitoring. Her texts and her cell phone calls, her frustrations were really starting.

12 (8m 11s):
He was so jealous and very possessive over her. She couldn't go out and hang out with friends without him freaking out and getting upset and pouting. Lindsay

2 (8m 22s):
Morris was Brandon's girlfriend and says Justine confided in her about problems with Danni.

12 (8m 29s):
She even said, I don't know if I break up with him if he'll ever really let me go.

11 (8m 36s):
Towards the end, she was trying to pursue certain things and he was trying to hold her back from, he didn't want anything to change and

2 (8m 43s):
She was sort of growing up and maybe growing apart from him at that point.

11 (8m 48s):
Yes, I think so.

2 (8m 51s):
Retired Placer County Detective Angela Ford says Danny's fears of Justine leaving him reached a fever pitch in April of 2003 when Justine met someone during a spring break trip to Florida,

8 (9m 5s):
Justine had developed a friendship with a navy sailor there at Pensacola. Did

2 (9m 10s):
She tell you about the man she met in Florida? She did. She liked him. I think it kind of opened her eyes.

8 (9m 16s):
When Justine came back, she was definitely talking about this guy and telling all of her friends about how amazing he was and how attractive he was and how she wished she could spend more time with him. Danny had gotten wind of this.

11 (9m 29s):
He thought he was losing her,

2 (9m 31s):
And they say Danny became consumed with the idea that Justine was cheating on him.

12 (9m 37s):
Danny had asked me would I be willing to wear a wire so I can get her to confess this? He wanted the proof. I told him absolutely not,

2 (9m 47s):
And there was another troubling dynamic among Justine, Danny and Brandon.

8 (9m 52s):
Once Justine came into the relationship, their friendship wasn't the same as it was before.

2 (9m 57s):
Justine believed Brandon was a serial cheater and a bad influence, so she gave Danny an ultimatum, him or her. Danny and Brandon lost touch for about a year, but by late 2002 they reconnected and decided to become roommates. It was a triangle that was sort of toxic at that point.

11 (10m 18s):
Exactly, and it kind of really fueled when Danny and Brandon moved in together.

2 (10m 22s):
Justine continued to be a thorn in Brandon's side.

12 (10m 26s):
Brandon hated Justine with a passion, would constantly say that she was a whore and that she would manipulated Danny.

2 (10m 35s):
In 2003, a few days before Labor Day, Justine attended a party at Danny and Brandon's apartment.

12 (10m 43s):
We sat on the front porch just talking and we both agreed that we were gonna get rid of these guys and that we wanted a fresh start and that we could do better.

1 (10m 55s):
Justine was getting ready to go to the next stage. Danny was not going to allow it

2 (11m 22s):
In the early morning hours of Tuesday, September 2nd, 2003, Lynette Vander Schutt found her daughter's bedroom empty and her truck gone from their driveway.

1 (11m 33s):
This was so uncharacteristic of their daughter, so different from any behaviors in the past.

6 (11m 39s):
She has no money, no ATM, no credit card, no. No identification on her at all.

2 (11m 47s):
Justine's family frantically turned to the community for help.

0 (11m 51s):
That's wonderful.

1 (11m 53s):
The Van Dechutes passionate and and they got organized.

13 (11m 56s):
This is my sister. She's been missing since Tuesday.

6 (11m 59s):
We went through all of Auburn hanging the missing poster flyers, tying the pink ribbons around 'cause pink was her favorite color. Justine, we love you. We're all out looking for you. Please call us and let us know you're okay.

2 (12m 15s):
Pretty soon everyone was looking for Justine. Was Danny assisting in any of these search efforts? In the beginning,

8 (12m 23s):
Danny showed up a number of times and he would wear the T-shirts. He seemed really concerned.

10 (12m 30s):
She's been gone for three days now and concern is growing.

2 (12m 33s):
The first break in the case came when Justine's truck was located at a park and ride about five miles from the Vander CHT home. It

14 (12m 42s):
Was parked right here in this parking space,

1 (12m 44s):
And once we had that, then our belief was that, you know, she was not far.

2 (12m 51s):
Matt Scribner was out riding his horse when he saw searchers gathered at the park and ride like many in the area. He had seen reports of Justine's disappearance.

3 (13m 1s):
I thought, well, they might be searching this area because at the time there was a direct access from the park and ride to this area.

2 (13m 10s):
A week earlier, he had seen a freshly dug hole along the trail, but as he rode through again this time, did you notice anything different?

3 (13m 19s):
The hole was not there anymore. There was debris over the top of it,

2 (13m 25s):
But the significance of that would not become clear until later.

3 (13m 30s):
I wasn't thinking like that. Nobody

2 (13m 31s):
Thinks like that. As the surge continued, Placer County district Attorney Morgan Geier says, investigators considered the possibility that Justine had left the state.

5 (13m 44s):
The park and ride is located on a very busy interstate, interstate 80 that runs the the length of our country. We have a car that is locked and looks as if it was left intentionally. Did she meet someone there and jump on the freeway?

2 (13m 57s):
Danny had told detectives early on about the Navy man Justine had met in Florida.

8 (14m 2s):
Danny was actually one of the first people to say, well, maybe she's off in Florida because there's some guy she likes in

1 (14m 8s):
Florida. You have to assume everything's possible. Our detectives made contact with the Naval Intelligence Service. They tracked him down right away, but

8 (14m 18s):
They did an extensive interview with him and it was determined that he didn't have anything to do with her disappearance.

1 (14m 24s):
Danny, however, kept throwing that out there.

2 (14m 26s):
Danny told the media about a strange call he had received.

7 (14m 30s):
There's been an inquiry to my credit in Florida. Someone tried to get a credit card there and I'm really hoping it's Justine.

10 (14m 37s):
They called tonight's vigil, the vigil of hope.

2 (14m 41s):
Her loved ones clung to the hope that she was still alive and thought she was possibly being held against her. Will

15 (14m 48s):
It you guys? That kid was doing all the support.

6 (14m 51s):
We're all gonna bring her home. We're gonna find her. She's gonna get away. She's a, she's a fighter.

2 (14m 58s):
Meanwhile, Danny appeared to be the distraught boyfriend on the local news.

7 (15m 2s):
Two and a half years of my life been devoted to that girl and now that that part of my life has gone,

2 (15m 8s):
Holding a photo of Justine and an engagement ring appraisal, he made his own plea.

7 (15m 14s):
She means more to me and her family than she does to you and whoever it is needs to just let her go and let her come home,

2 (15m 22s):
But suspicion was growing around. Danny and friends were coming forward about his toxic relationship with Justine.

1 (15m 31s):
Danny's possessive. He's jealous, he's angry. He believes Justine is cheating on him. He's angrier, and all those things began to roll.

2 (15m 42s):
Detectives also began looking deeper into his relationship with Brandon.

1 (15m 47s):
As we interviewed, more and more people find these guys were together. Generally what they did, they did together.

5 (15m 55s):
By most accounts, Danny sort of looked up to Brandon. Brandon was known to be smart, somewhat cunning. He sort of had an edge to him.

2 (16m 3s):
They had some things in common like juvenile brushes with the law.

5 (16m 8s):
Danny Besser had a history of thefts, burglaries, possession of stolen property. Brandon Fernandez had been prosecuted for essentially computer hacking

12 (16m 17s):
For somebody who was a total geek. He was very, very confident in himself. Danny was more of a follower

2 (16m 27s):
And detectives learned. They shared a disturbing fixation with murder.

1 (16m 32s):
They talked about killing people. They talked about disposing in the bodies beating polygraphs well before the disappearance of Justine Van Schutt.

12 (16m 41s):
He had told me there's a couple spots where if I ever wanted to kill you, nobody would ever find you. This was something he had just said. As a joke,

2 (16m 50s):
Brandon had created a website ranking levels of violence.

1 (16m 55s):
He had pictures of people dead dying, things

5 (16m 58s):
That give you chills up the back of your neck. One of

2 (16m 60s):
The levels discussed thinking about committing some form of violence but not doing it. Another level talked about committing the violence contemplated on an animal. I mean, that's not normal behavior for a young man.

5 (17m 11s):
It is not normal behavior and it is certainly consistent with those who find value and thrill in killing other human beings.

2 (17m 21s):
Investigators questioned Danny and Brandon throughout the investigation. Both of them said they had spent the evening alone together in their apartment.

1 (17m 30s):
The fact that each boy was the other's alibi is a red flag

2 (17m 35s):
And that wasn't the only red flag. As detectives retraced Justine's last steps, they knew her cell phone shut off in the area where her truck was found, but then they found something very interesting.

1 (17m 48s):
They got the last two incoming phone calls to her on the night she was murdered. They were both from brand The Fernandez.

2 (18m 11s):
As the search for Justine Vander shoot entered its third week,

10 (18m 15s):
Day 15 that Justine Vander shoot has been missing.

2 (18m 18s):
There was no sign of the missing teen alive or dead.

1 (18m 22s):
We had no body. We didn't have a lot.

2 (18m 25s):
Sheriff's detectives decided to up the ante. They enlisted the help of the FBI to interview Danny and Brandon again.

1 (18m 33s):
We needed separate them, number one, but to have one role on the other.

2 (18m 38s):
On September 17th, 2003, detectives questioned Danny Bessemer at Sheriff's Headquarters.

9 (18m 45s):
Tell me why you didn't do it. Because I was sleeping

2 (18m 48s):
The same afternoon. Detective Angela Ford and FBI agent Jeff Renick and his partner drove Brandon Fernandez from his job to the FBI building in Sacramento. Did he seem nervous? I mean, when the FBI shows up at your job and wants to talk to you, he,

5 (19m 6s):
He didn't seem nervous. He seemed like he had nothing to hide.

2 (19m 10s):
Brandon told the agents he had jet skied all day with coworkers and after going home, he went out to run an errand because he wasn't feeling well.

9 (19m 19s):
I went down to get a VA juice. I had the flu at this point.

2 (19m 23s):
He said he got pulled over for running a stop sign and accidentally called Justine twice.

9 (19m 29s):
Justine's cell phone was right next to my girlfriend's number.

2 (19m 32s):
He said he returned home and went to bed. Brandon said Danny had also been home after having dinner with the Vander shoots, but the agents were about to catch Brandon. In a big lie,

1 (19m 44s):
Danny and Brandon first said, no, we were by ourselves. Well, no. It turns out that they weren't.

2 (19m 48s):
Sheriff's detectives had received a tip from Brandon's cousin, Clayton Cole. He told them that he and a friend had stayed at Brandon and Danny's place. The night Justine went missing and saw them leave.

8 (20m 1s):
They knew that Danny and Brandon didn't come back until much later.

9 (20m 4s):
We're gonna play something to you. What is this?

5 (20m 11s):
What Brandon didn't know is that the investigators had a a recorded phone call.

2 (20m 14s):
After receiving that tip, detectives had asked Clayton to call Brandon and recorded the conversation.

16 (20m 23s):
I talked to my dad about the soul testing thing and I had to go to the cops today.

2 (20m 27s):
On the call, Brandon repeatedly told Clayton to lie to police and to say that Clayton and his friend weren't there that night.

16 (20m 37s):
Seriously, like if you guys say anything different then,

8 (20m 43s):
And at that point he knew we had a lot more information

2 (20m 47s):
With Brandon. Now rattled, agent Renick asked a key question,

9 (20m 52s):
Have you ever seen anyone die? Brandon? Yes.

5 (20m 59s):
He went white.

2 (20m 60s):
Brandon broke and admitted he knew where Justine was, but first he said he needed protection from Danny.

9 (21m 9s):
Can you take me somewhere safe? Can you bring my girlfriend somewhere safe?

2 (21m 12s):
He wants to tell you a little bit more, but he's pointing it towards Danny.

5 (21m 16s):
It's all towards Danny. I had nothing to do with it.

9 (21m 19s):
He's scary, intelligent. He has built everything in lies. He is a great actor. He's a monster. Sorry. How long was it planned to hurt Justine? Long. He had planned it forever almost.

2 (21m 39s):
Brandon told them he knew Danny had tapped Justine's phone to catch her cheating and confront her.

9 (21m 46s):
I didn't know what was gonna happen that night,

2 (21m 48s):
But Brandon insisted. He had no idea Danny would seek revenge that night. He says, as far as he knew, they were just going to meet up with Justine to steal marijuana plants from a farm. He now said, those calls to Justine's phone were him trying to get hold of Danny to back out and Danny said, no, ma'am. You need to come up here. Brandon said He met up with Danny and Justine at the park and ride around midnight and they got in his car with Danny giving directions. When he parked, he said Danny wanted to talk to Justine alone, so he walked away for a bit.

9 (22m 24s):
I went down this hill and I was looking around and I figured out he was still up there for a while.

2 (22m 29s):
After a few minutes, he says he heard the car horn followed by a scream. He hurried back to find. Danny had strangled Justine, his hand still around her neck and a taser next to her lifeless body.

9 (22m 43s):
He looked at me and he just was psycho. His eyes were just bulging out and he was laughing. He was saying, I win, I win.

2 (22m 51s):
Brandon said Those words were in reference to a song called The Game The Danny had playing on a loop in Brandon's car, a soundtrack to her murder,

5 (23m 5s):
The lyrics detail, a girlfriend's infidelity and her ultimate murder by her boyfriend and interspersed with that song are vignettes of Justine's own words as she's talking either to another boy or about another boy

2 (23m 21s):
And some of the lyrics just excruciating. You always wanted people to remember you don't, you know your wish is coming true today. Another victim dies tonight. The fear that she must have faced.

5 (23m 32s):
I can only imagine if you saw it in a movie, you probably wouldn't believe it.

2 (23m 36s):
I was, even though Brandon had initially said Justine was dead. When he made it back up the hill, his story began to evolve.

5 (23m 45s):
What he was doing was slowly putting himself at the scene of the death. Did

9 (23m 54s):
You hear her exhale? Yes. It was like, it was like a, a really screwed up breath, like kept happening.

5 (24m 3s):
According to Brandon, she was still alive at that point and also according to Brandon, she was already dead at that point. His own statements internally or inconsistent and demonstrate where he's trying to lie. To get out of this,

2 (24m 16s):
Brandon said Danny removed her clothing and put her in a grave. They dug that night and poured a liquid over her to decompose the body. He says he prayed for it to end.

9 (24m 28s):
I said, please just go. You wanted her to die so it'd be over. I thought she might have still been alive if she was gonna do something more brutal. If she was,

5 (24m 38s):
He's watching her die

2 (24m 39s):
And he's not helping her.

5 (24m 41s):
He's not helping her. No,

2 (24m 42s):
But Brandon said he was scared Danny would kill him too.

9 (24m 46s):
He made me barrier and he made me promise and say that I was his brother, that I would never say anything, and he said he would kill himself or others. And then he had mentioned my girlfriend and Justine's family. He said he was gonna take them out next.

2 (25m 1s):
After a four and a half hour interview, Brandon agreed to take them to the scene.

8 (25m 7s):
It was about nine 30 at night, so

2 (25m 9s):
Dark walking through this, I can only imagine

8 (25m 12s):
When we first pulled up to come here, there was something shiny on the ground. It was a piece of her jewelry. It was two little cherries put together

2 (25m 22s):
A few yards away in a clearing among the trees, her grave lay hidden under an old mattress.

18 (25m 32s):
Danny? Yes. I'm Sergeant McConnell. I want to show this to you.

2 (25m 36s):
It wasn't long before detectives informed Danny who said very little during his six hour interrogation that they'd found the grave site.

18 (25m 46s):
I just got back from there. Guess who took us there, and guess who's he's blaming for the whole thing.

2 (25m 51s):
The next morning, a team of investigators digging through the hard clay dirt unearthed Justine van Deshoot's remains.

1 (25m 59s):
There's a relief and then there's pain.

2 (26m 3s):
Danny and Brandon were both arrested and charged with Justine's murder After two and a half weeks. The search was finally over, but justice would prove elusive.

11 (26m 24s):
I drove home and I see the chaplain and I see detectives. My mom's crying and my dad said, your sister's not coming home. I passed out literally,

2 (26m 37s):
And it's still hard to relive that moment. Yeah. On September 18th, 2003, Justine's family shared their heartbreak with the community.

1 (26m 50s):
I almost sensed Lynette just crumbling and I put my hand on her shoulder. I just kind of propped her up and we announced that this family's worst fears had come true.

10 (27m 6s):
Danny Bessemer and his roommate Brandon Fernandez, were arrested Wednesday.

4 (27m 11s):
If the two gentlemen that are in custody now are responsible for this, they need to burn in hell.

2 (27m 20s):
Detectives interviewed Danny Besser again and told him they needed information about Brandon Fernandez's role in the murder.

18 (27m 27s):
Just talk about Brandon. Don't talk about Danny

2 (27m 29s):
Believing Brandon has a deal with the FBI. Danny tried to haggle. How

18 (27m 34s):
Can I give the same Brandon's I don't have the authority for? Let's make a deal. Okay.

2 (27m 40s):
Ultimately, he broke down and started talking.

18 (27m 44s):
I really want to tell you everything I do.

2 (27m 48s):
Danny admitted he had started to strangle Justine, but then

18 (27m 52s):
She said four words that just changed my mind. Those words were, Danny, I love you,

2 (28m 5s):
But he said Brandon was the one who encouraged him to keep going.

18 (28m 9s):
He tells me it's too late now, already attempted murder.

2 (28m 13s):
Danny admitted he had poured drain cleaner over Justine's body, but said Brandon had poured it down her throat.

8 (28m 21s):
There was a black tarry substance on top of her, and then after the autopsy there was a black tarry substance inside of her lungs.

2 (28m 31s):
Justine's official cause of death was listed as homicidal violence, but further testing suggested she had also ingested dirt.

5 (28m 41s):
There is no other way to be that far down and into the bronchial canals means she inhaled it. She was alive.

2 (28m 51s):
Taking into consideration the family's wishes to avoid a painful prolonged trial, prosecutors at the time offered a plea deal as a condition of his plea agreement. Danny spoke with detectives again and gave new details about Brandon's role. What was the story he started to tell?

5 (29m 10s):
Danny tells a story. Ultimately that involves Brandon as the mastermind. Brandon is claiming he is merely a victim of circumstance and he panicked and participated in the cleanup and the getaway,

2 (29m 23s):
So we know the truth lies somewhere in the middle.

5 (29m 26s):
It really does, and Brandon does a pretty good job of incriminating. Danny and Danny does a pretty good job of incriminating Brandon.

2 (29m 35s):
In 2005, Danny Bessemer pleaded guilty to first degree murder. In exchange for a sentence of 25 years to life, Brandon Fernandez pleaded to second degree murder and received 15 years to life.

4 (29m 52s):
A piece of justice was served, at least we can put some of this behind us. Part

5 (29m 56s):
Of their plan was to receive a life sentence that allowed them to at least become eligible for parole and maybe have a chance someday.

2 (30m 3s):
Justine's family made it their mission to ensure that would never happen. Brandon Fernandez came up for parole in 2017 and was denied. Every

11 (30m 13s):
Time they get denied a, that's justice for her.

2 (30m 16s):
The family breathed a sigh of relief, but their lives would soon be upended once again.

5 (30m 22s):
In 2018, California changed the law of murder. In 2020, Brandon Fernandez filed a petition to get out of his murder conviction. Based on the new law,

2 (30m 33s):
The new law reduced the fault of defendants who didn't actually do the killing like a getaway driver, Brandon wanted to have his life sentence for second degree murder thrown out and to be resentenced as an accessory after the fact,

6 (30m 48s):
He still has not taken any responsibility. He's guilty just as much as Danny

2 (30m 54s):
Brandon's defense attorney Steve Dilip Lopez maintains his client was only guilty of being taken in by Danny Schemes.

19 (31m 2s):
Clearly, Brandon was in the wrong. He shouldn't have participated in the coverup of this and that's what he did, and absolutely he should be convicted of that, but shouldn't be held responsible for a murder.

2 (31m 15s):
A judge presiding over the re-sentencing case in 2020 denied Brandon's motion, but that ruling was reversed by the court of appeals and sent back due to yet another shift in the legal standard, both sides would now have to fight it out in court in an evidentiary hearing.

5 (31m 33s):
We had to call all of the witnesses and we had to prove Mr. Fernandez's guilt.

19 (31m 37s):
The district attorney has to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt and the judge has to make findings beyond a reasonable doubt.

2 (31m 44s):
In May, 2024, it would be up to Deputy DA Tim Wirtz to prove that Brandon Fernandez helped plan and carry out Justine's murder.

1 (31m 55s):
Once they started kicking this idea around they, they built off each other.

2 (31m 59s):
His key witness was Danny Bessemer, who over several days testified how he and Brandon Fernandez were two pillars in the plot to lure Justine to her death.

1 (32m 13s):
Danny talks about how he doesn't wanna let Brandon down when they're out there digging the grave, and Brandon says This better not be for nothing.

2 (32m 19s):
Danny described how he and Brandon assumed different responsibilities.

1 (32m 24s):
Danny was gonna kill her and Brandon was going to be involved in the coverup side of things. The the forensics, as he described it, Brandon purchased the chemicals that were poured over Justine.

2 (32m 34s):
According to Danny, he and Brandon Pred dug the grave over several days.

1 (32m 40s):
The last time they go to the grave before they bring Justine, there is that Mondays during the day to check it out in the light and possibly do some digging,

2 (32m 48s):
And Danny says, Brandon provided the tools used to dig, including a pick axe he took from his parents' house

1 (32m 55s):
After they killed Justine and bury her. They throw them over the fence at Brandon's parents' house and the police go and corroborate that.

2 (33m 3s):
The prosecution says it found other evidence at Brandon's workplace that he never mentioned, like pieces of the recording device used to tap Justine's phone and in his shredder a receipt for a brand new set of tires. He was already covering his tracks the day after

5 (33m 21s):
What we call in the in the prosecution world, consciousness of guilt.

2 (33m 26s):
Brandon's defense attorney insists Brandon was only trying to hide his role in the coverup, not the murder, and he says that relying on Danny Bessemer's testimony is a sign of the prosecution's desperation.

19 (33m 40s):
They don't have a case.

4 (33m 49s):
I often wonder, will I ever get a hundred percent of the truth? I don't think we ever will.

2 (33m 55s):
You think he's still a danger? Yes, definitely. Brandon's defense attorney Steve Dilip says Danny Bessemer is the real danger and points out. It was Danny who broke bread with Justine's family knowing he was going to kill her that night. This

19 (34m 12s):
Is Ted Bundy in the making. Somebody who has no conscience, somebody who has no empathy for other people, basically a psychopath

2 (34m 21s):
And he argues Danny will say anything in court to improve his chances of being paroled.

19 (34m 27s):
He wants everything to look like Brandon made him do this. He's at that point, told either four or five different stories about what happened

2 (34m 36s):
In his cross-examination. De Felippe picks apart inconsistencies in Danny's statements about Brandon's involvement.

19 (34m 44s):
You can't corroborate any of his story and and that's deliberately done by him because he knows that it can't be refuted.

2 (34m 50s):
In fact, he argues that the evidence contradicts Danny's story. For one thing, he says, if Brandon was really in charge of forensics, he wouldn't leave a trail of evidence.

19 (35m 0s):
The guy who was in charge of forensics is not going to do any of the things that Brandon did. Brandon takes the shovel and leaves it at his parents' home. Why would you put something involved in the homicide at your parents' home? Why would you drive your car up to the scene knowing that you're gonna leave tire tracks on the dirt? You wouldn't do that,

2 (35m 22s):
And another discrepancy. Danny's claim that he and Brandon poured drain cleaner on Justine doesn't match the autopsy findings. Instead, those results indicate she ingested methanol, a toxic chemical compound found in a variety of products, but not drain cleaners, but Tim wts counters that. Danny has no reason to lie about that.

1 (35m 46s):
I don't know what theory under which the parole board might look favorably upon draino, but unfavorably upon methanol being poured on her. The only explanation is that he's honestly mistaken and the only way he'd be mistaken is if he wasn't the one that bought it,

2 (36m 0s):
And De Felippe says Brandon has an alibi for that Monday afternoon before the murder. When Danny claims they went to the grave site.

19 (36m 8s):
We know that Brandon was up at the lake that day.

2 (36m 11s):
Wirtz points out there was a two hour window when Brandon left to pick up tools to fix a broken jet ski.

1 (36m 18s):
It's just not an alibi. There's plenty of time for him to have done what he said.

2 (36m 22s):
De Felippe says the timing still doesn't match up with Danny's story.

19 (36m 27s):
Danny also said that the digging was later in the day. It was not in the morning time, which is when Brandon got the tools and went back,

2 (36m 34s):
But the prosecution argues that the defense can't get around. Matt Scribner's testimony that he saw a freshly dug hole three days prior to the murder, which is consistent with Danny's account of digging the grave over several days.

1 (36m 50s):
This wasn't a panic dig that they did at the last minute where Brandon's terrified for his life the way it actually pans out. Brandon is given immense power. Brandon knows where the body is.

2 (37m 1s):
After more than two weeks of testimony, the judge gets the case. If Brandon's motion is granted, he will walk free. It's a familiar fear for the Vander shoots.

6 (37m 12s):
The hands shaking, just trying to get ready. Absolute, absolutely. This brings the emotions up all over again.

4 (37m 18s):
You don't know what to expect.

2 (37m 20s):
On August 1st, 2024 before a courtroom packed with the Vander Schuttes and their supporters as well as Brandon Fernandez, who appeared via video conference and his parents, the judge issued his ruling, was there a palpable concern for the Vander shoots that one of their daughter's murders could go free?

5 (37m 41s):
That fear, that concern. You could cut it with a knife.

2 (37m 45s):
Cameras were allowed in court, but we were not allowed to record audio. The judge denied Brandon Fernandez's motion and upheld his conviction,

11 (37m 56s):
So I was very nervous. I let out a big sigh as soon as he said it, so it was just, yay. Feels really good. Some justice.

6 (38m 4s):
Justice for Justine again, he did not get out. Very relieved.

2 (38m 10s):
The judge said it was difficult to parse the truth from lies told by both Danny and Brandon, but he says ultimately it was evident Brandon was in on the murder plot and easily led investigators to Justine's body through rugged terrain in the dark. Brandon brought you here and pinpointed exactly. I mean, he knew exactly where it was. He did.

8 (38m 36s):
He gave us instructions and even said you wouldn't find it on your own.

2 (38m 40s):
The ruling is a big win for the Vander shoots, but only temporary relief

6 (38m 45s):
In two years. We've got two more parole hearings coming up. We're not

11 (38m 48s):
Going away. We're never giving up.

4 (38m 50s):
I'll be there with my cane. I think this one right here is my favorite.

2 (38m 55s):
They're critical of evolving laws that have allowed Brandon Fernandez to keep re-litigating his role in Justine's murder.

11 (39m 3s):
I kind of like feel at times we've been on pause. We really haven't been able to move forward because we have to relive it.

2 (39m 9s):
In issuing his ruling, the judge acknowledged that the legal system can seem unfair to the victim's families and to survivors.

5 (39m 17s):
I wholeheartedly agree. Oftentimes, it feels as if the only rights we are trying to respect are those of the convicted and the guilty and not grieving family members that underlies the problems with this law because it decreases people's faith in the system that there's finality.

2 (39m 36s):
It's something that Van Deschutes are trying to change by advocating for victims' rights.

11 (39m 42s):
We're trying to do everything we can to prevent this happening to somebody else's family.

2 (39m 47s):
They also partner with the Placer County DA to sponsor new state legislation. Justine's Law, as it's called, passed in 2023 and provides teen dating, violence prevention education in high schools throughout California. What do you want Justine's legacy to be now?

6 (40m 7s):
To help educate other boys and girls even if it saves one life, it's worth everything.

2 (40m 15s):
Matt Scribner says he can't ride through these trails without thinking of Justine.

3 (40m 21s):
In one aspect, it's quiet. They've cleaned the area up. It's beautiful.

2 (40m 25s):
In some ways, it's almost like Justine is shining here.

3 (40m 30s):
I believe that

6 (40m 33s):
We think of her as hummingbirds come to us. A lot of times when we're back here working in the garden, I'll have a little hummingbird. She'll come right up to my face and I'll, I'll talk to her and I think of her as she's saying hi to me.
