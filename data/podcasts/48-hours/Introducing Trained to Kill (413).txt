Nestled in the far reaches of Puget Sound in the Pacific Northwest, you can find a chain of gorgeous tranquil islands. It's so beautiful, but it's, it's changed for me now. I don't. It's marred. In 2009, three days before Halloween, a grizzly crime stunned the seaport town of Anacortes, Washington. I can only describe it as evil. Something horrible, something terrible. The blood on the walls, the blood on the carpet. It told a story of what took place.


The scene was at the house of a popular dog trainer named Mark Stover. Mark was known as the dog whisper of Anacortes and The Dog Trainer to the stars. He could speak dog. They knew that he knew them. There was blood on Mark's driveway and blood on the floor throughout his house, but there was no sign of Mark. I've never seen in my career a case that has as many twists and turns and mysteries as this case with Mark Tover. They soon discovered a story tangled in obsession.


His eyes went just crazy. He clenched his hands and fists and he was just in a shaking rage, A love triangle between Mark Stover. He couldn't control his obsession. You know, he chronicled his obsession. Mr Is war. This is God war. He worked my life enough. An Hess who wanted a new life. I think Linda m diagnoses more than what she's telling And her new lover. It's a beautiful love. In my opinion, it's it's legendary. Throughout this case, detectives wonder who was the hunter and who was the hunted.
