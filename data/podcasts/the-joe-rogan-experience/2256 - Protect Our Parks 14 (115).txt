It's Just rules from like low level influencers in the Hasidic community. It's crazy what you've, like, I get so many of 'em every day, so I send 'em to him. What are the rules? Oh, it's all like, are you allowed when you, your frying pin, when you use your frying pan for eggs, are you allowed to use it for me?


Say you go on vacation and your your, your pot isn't kosher. What can you do on the Sabbath? You can take it to the ocean. Throwing an ocean. They're throwing the fucking pots in the ocean to make it kosher. Yeah. You have to let go of it. You have to let go of it. They have a rule. You have to drop it in the water and let go of it. Are following These rules. Oh yeah. Those people are, and it's also funny, like you click on the link he sent you and the first thing you hear is Tell 'em to put the fires out with the weather. Get some rain over there. Yeah. They don't really control the weather, obviously. Obviously not Otherwise hurricanes wouldn't hit Florida. Ah, true. Good point. They Barely get their pots kosher. Yeah, no, they make 'em hit Florida. So they get their wills.


Yeah. Tell the old people. It's hilarious that some people are saying climate change. This is climate change. This is, no, this is fucking arson. That wasn't a JA Jew. That wasn't a Jew that was a whiny liberal. This is climate change. Borderline Jew. Like, No, no. The, I'm doing a New York thing. I'm doing a New York thing.

That's a strong accusation. Bold. No, no, just kidding. But they've been trying to get rid of the homeless for a while, Bro.


The homeless are doing it. Well, they're flammable. Everyone is, but they, they're more inclined to use fire to get their anger out. Yeah, That's true. Yeah. Rebates. Sugarman actually caught people lighting things on fire. He filmed it. He put it up on his Instagram. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. In the middle of the firestorm, people were lighting things on fire to contribute to the fire. Wow. You've got losers. Whoa. You have a hundred thousand losers that are just camping on your street. What do you think's gonna happen? What do you think's gonna happen when the people with the houses are in jeopardy? What do you think is gonna happen when these people that are living in 50 million houses and you're camping out a block away, which is exactly what's going on over there.


And the looting And the looting. Well, they, they looted people's houses. Yeah. When they found out that places were getting evacuated, swarms of organized gangs were showing up. This lady said a hundred guys showed up in front front of this house, and she thought they were helping our neighbor move, and they just broke down the door and started stealing TVs, stealing everything. What if the house burnt down? It's kind of an if The house burnt down, but that What if the house doesn't burn down? Know you just stole all their shit. Yeah. Right. Yeah. It's like you can't do that. Of course, you, it's a break. Obviously. I'm not actually defending it, obviously, But I see their point too. If I was super poor. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, if I was super poor and we were living in the fucking hood, and then someone came along and said, listen, they're evacuating these fucking communities anyway, man, fuck it.


Let's go get paid. Like, let's go Get the house gonna burn down. They're gonna get insurance. And If you live in, in LA and you get caught it, they just let you go. Yeah, That's True. They just let you go. And then didn't Biden say he is given full coverage for this one? How can That be? That's so much. Money's delusional. The same thing as, you know, He also said College, college debt. He just says it. We're gonna cover don't, not gonna pardon? He Also saying he Saudi, He could have beaten Trump. He said that too. Oh, It's crazy. A fight. He did say that also. No, no. In The election. Oh, wow. Beat Trump. Oh, yeah. He said he could have beat him in a fight too. He said that. That would be Great. Imagine those two fighting. How much would you pay? It'd be just like the Jake Paul Tyson Fight. I paid So to be there that paid stuff.


I'd be so sad. Yeah. Trump would get him though. Trump would fall on him. Oh, a hundred percent. Trump would tackle him. Oh, A hundred percent bigger. Trump would bite his face off. He would, he would grab his thumbs, shove them into his eyes and bite his face off. Yeah. 100% would Be a nasty fucking, they're two totally different kinds of humans. Yeah, that's true. True. Biden is used to like secret service around him his whole life. Trump is a psychopath. Yeah. He will throw those thumbs right as fucking eyeballs like the mountain did to the gay guy. Game of Thrones. Wasn't that a Steven Segal movie too, where he did that? Was it that who probably who did with the Jamaicans? What? Who was Thats Steven Segal movie. He hit a movie. Yeah. With the sword fighting. Correct. Yeah. Yeah. He, he eyeball those Guys.


Did he eyeball the guy? Man. Oh damn. Listen, man, if you watch the UFC eyeball pokes, even to the most badass fucking dudes in the world are devastating. Yeah. Crazy. Like a nut shot is way easier to recover from than a, a fucking hard eye poke. That's true. It is funny to see them all tough and then go owieowie My eyeball. Yeah. Yeah. But it's just so crazy. We still have this, you still allow fingers, my eyeballs. This this is totally unnecessary. This doesn't contribute to fighting. Have their fingers free. They'll Have the John Jones. I've been saying. I know. So what, tape them all up? No, no. They need a glove that covers the fingers. It's real simple. And then you have thumbs still, but you're gonna eliminate the amount. There it is. He called it, Ari called it.


That's what Trump would do to Biden So fake. It looks so real. Back then It was 1990. That stuck with you. You saw that? That's Crazy. Losing white predator.

Although Bora too, he is kind of shitting on a lot of poor people and it got weird. Yeah. I dunno if you saw that one. Yeah. But you know, you take your swings. Yeah, sure. Sometimes you connect story of my life. Sometimes you're shitting on poor people. Yeah, I guess so. It used to be okay to do that. Like Sam Kinisons Best Bit was the bit about starving kids in Africa. Yeah, That's, oh my God, it was so funny. Fucking Bit was so good. Go Where there's food, nothing but Sam. Hey, come here. You know, to be years from now. Fuck it. We got deserts in America too. We just don't live in a asshole. Oh ha. Yeah. George Carlin saw that and was like, that guy's good. Yeah.

Yeah. Like you're being silly. It's the, whatever's the best way you can get that idea out. And for Kinison, imagine him doing his shit deadpan. Like, shut up. Oh shut the fuck up Was part of it. It's Part of his fucking primal anger. Seems Hedberg being weird. Yeah. It's like part of delivery. Yes. Right. Same thing. And the heroin, you know, They asked him Kinison like, how come you don't, you don't make fun of women, you don't make fun of men. He goes, A man has never made me want to drive into a tree. He died by a drunk driver. By a Drunk driver. By a drunk driver. Yeah. I'm Not crazy. Well, I always remember his bits. You know, when I was in high school, one of my friends killed somebody driving drunk. Really?

He got really drunk one night and he crashed his car and he killed his friend. Oh. And so Kennison used to have this joke and where he would be like, he goes, we're gonna drink And we're gonna drive and we're gonna pull it off. You know why? Because we do it every fucking day. But to me this was like, that ended, well this was Kinison. Oh no. When he was doing like an impression of Kinison. Like Kinison is a cautionary tale. Yeah. Yeah. Because Kinison was the best on earth for like three or four years. The best on earth. But the partying and the fame and it all went away. If you're a, you're a standup comedy fan, I implore you, this is what you do.

Yes, they did. Like eighth or 10th on, on sixth Street. And it was Yeah, the, the safest block in. Oh yeah. You couldn't do shit. No. Well that was always the thing about if you lived on Staten Island or if you lived Out, that's where All the cops live. Yeah. Yeah. Or if you lived where, you know fucking when what's face was alive, John Gotti was alive. Like his neighborhood was super safe. Of course, nobody's, nobody's breaking into anything over there. No. And you get a Turkey on Thanksgiving. Yeah. Throwing those butterballs out. Yeah. But at what cost? I like the Turkey thing. They all do the Turkey thing and act like they're innocent now.

How many turkeys? Like So they could see you live in a neighborhood of a hundred thousand people and you give out free turkeys. How many turkeys do you think you're really giving out? Probably it's a photo people. So probably 50 people. Families. Five. How Many, how many turkeys do you have to buy? Mm. I think because if you run out, people are gonna get mad.

Why are we trying to fight China? Because We're stealing China's data and they're throwing drones over New Jersey.


It's a war. It's a war. Us. Why are we at war with them? I don't know. We're not They're communists. It's just a de I think they are. Oh, I thought they Were. No, they're I think They allegedly, but Oh, they seem politically Communist. My they appoint their own government. It's That They're about that money right now. It's about that money too. It's weird. Capitalist communism. It's a weird sort of a merger, which makes it very difficult to doubt battle with because you have a dictatorship that's connected to a thriving economy. Tell Me this TikTok though, like they're stealing your data. Yeah, but isn't also All the American companies. Oh Shit, I'm listening. Whatcha Some kind of communist? Whose team are you on? You know what are is on?


Yeah. Oh yeah. The he IF Free Palestine. I'm on Team Green. You know what they needed is Xi Jing to visit la They'd clean it up in a day. Yeah. Isn't that funny? They could get, they would get it done. They did it for when China, when they came to San Francisco. Yeah. Crazy. Yeah, that's right. Boy. Did you see Gavin Newsom's latest speech where he was talking about, we're gonna get to the bottom of this. No. About doing something with the land. Have you seen that? Jamie Gavin Jsom Have Jamie, have you seen it? Did you see Danny Polish deep fake of of his speech? No. Danny Polish. He's at deep fake. They're very so funny. Just making him say dumb shit. He tricks me a lot. He goes, we put fire our, our our T tarent on.


That's crazy. Yeah. That news's a lot of hot Water. See If you can find this video. Because what's really weird is he does like a little dance with his shoulders when he talks about it. Watches little shi shimmy. This is so crazy. Great hair though. Listen to this. Beautiful, listen to this Beautiful. And with a myriad of issues. I I'm, I was just talking to Josh Green, the governor of down in in Hawaii. You had some ideas around some land use concerns he has around speculators coming in. Oh Yeah. I do that when I, so we're Already working with our legal teams to, to move those things forward. And we'll be presenting those in, in a matter of days. Not just weeks. Legal teams. What Is that man? But look at this. Like, the thing in Hawaii has been a fucking disaster for the people that lost their houses.


No one's rebuilt. No one's rebuilt. Right. So he's talking about that and talking to the governor who's obviously mishandled that. It's also like, what's the real answer? I was like, it's fucked, But hey, what is, yeah. No, no, no. What is This? I Don't know. What is this? What is, it's a fun thing. He picked up. What is getting excited about it? Yeah. We're talking about this about some speculation, some land. That's like a lady Thing. See what he, he's dating somebody new. No, he, he's pulling some of Hide his excitement for the possibilities that they might acquire some of that land. What does that land become now? How many of these people are gonna be able to rebuild? What happens with the coastal commission? What happens with All the insurance companies that decided to cancel their fire insurance? Yeah. So what happens with all this is not as simple as anybody thinks.


Any fire would be like, you get your insurance money and you rebuild. You don't rebuild somewhere that's bigger than Manhattan. They lost what's larger than Manhattan. And also insurance is not gonna pay. They're, they're too much As little as possible gonna take forever. How are they gonna have the money? How are they gonna have $150 billion? That's they farm. But that's the amount of money they required. So was the government gonna do it? Is the Biden administration gonna step up, save The insurance Companies they did for Ukraine. They spent $175 million on Ukraine. How much are they gonna spend on the Palisades? And if they did it for the Palisades, the Hollywood Hills gonna be like, what the fuck dude. Yeah. What about us? Right? What about us? What about all these other fires?


What about North Carolina? Yes. North Carolina, people are waiting in line for hours for propane because they don't have gas. They're trying to stay alive because their fucking heaters need gas. No propane, no gain. Mm. But yeah, you're right. Hey Katrina, I went through, I was in Katrina. I was in New Orleans. It's the same shit. Yeah. Weren't they saving the rich people? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But this is crazy. This is way worse. If, If they bail out the Palisades. That's crazy. If you don't bail out Maui and it's a year later and you decide you're gonna bail out the parasites. So it kind of stuck. 'cause all he would've taken is $5 billion and they accidentally paid an extra 6 billion to Ukraine. They're like, don't worry. Just mistake.


It was an accidental 6,000,000,005. What? To help Maui. Yeah. Rebuild entirely. So for $5 billion, they didn everyone could have got their home back and everything could have been settled. And no, nothing's been done. But yet we keep sending money to these other countries. So how come arm dealers can make money? Why do these countries throw us a buck? Every now and then you're doing is paying their the last 78 years. Here's the Thing. Even if you are supporting the idea of sending money to Ukraine, I'm not arguing against that. I'm saying they accidentally sent 6 billion there and no one cared. And they didn't send 5 billion to Maui. Right. And they could have Also just get it back. Like it's not actually, you're not shipping a big thing of money.


Just like I think they, you're wiring. I Think they, I think that's how to do it. Oh Really? So You can pay Cash. Just bucked. Just boats fill, just prepay Visa cards. Buckets of money. We should Do it. We should buy all blockbuster cards. We should buy Greenland. That's An idea. We should buy Greenland. That's right. Isn't that what Trump's trying to do? Yeah's A lot of resources over there. What's Again? Well, if global warming hits, we gotta sweet spot. I like it. If global performing really takes off be nice. It's Greenland going, you know how many people live there? 56 k. We can kill them in an hour. There's only 56,000 people there. The whole island. Really? Yeah. Wow. Give it A goog. What are they like? I don't know's. Hanging out. What's hanging out? One of those guys. Their houses are weird. What do you think they're like, like Shaqs. Colorful.


They probably sh smell like old hot dogs. Yeah. Yeah. Pull smell up. Reindeer. They've been fucking, yeah. What have they been eating? What kind of like fermented shark meat. Gotta Be inbreeding there. For Real. Oh, easy. Gotta be inbreeding. Oh, it's cute little town actually. Yeah. Nice colorful shacks. That is adorable. Where's the bar? Show me the bar. 'cause it's gotta be a bar. Oh. They all be a good bar. You live good bar or a really bad bar? Some real fishermen, drunks. I mean, how many times does everybody date everybody else's ex in that town? Everybody. You just gotta get over it. You gotta get over it. You just, it's like ice school. You just gotta get over it. That's not very electricity's dating him now. Yeah. Yeah. What do they do for electricity?


I fucking, what do they Do? Is it Norway? That they have a, a dating app that won't let you fuck your ice sister ice Iceland? Or is It Iceland? Yeah. To know if you're how close the, you're true. They tried, they tried giving that to Middle East and they were the Middle East. Like, no, we like it. They have Called. It's all relative. That was a conversation that Gavin McGinness and I had on the podcast at one point in time. Who was talking to me about the numbers of people that are inbred? I think it was in the Middle East. Was he in Palestine or Pakistan? Palestine's. One of 'em. Mm. It's like 40%. Israel is one of them. Fudge Pakistan? No. Definitely. No. What do you mean? No, if you guys do some breeds, what Are you talking about? You Breed in Brooklyn. I'll tell you that. Not cousin do they in Brooklyn, bro. In Breeding. Oh yeah. Really? That's bad. That's like Jewish.


I looked it up instead of two in Israel. Look up the numbers. You can look it up. Let's take a look at Brooklyn. Serious. Huge. Serious. Huge palestine's. Huge. Thank you. Is huge. Boy, you're deflecting away from the Israel. Israel Just magically is not one of them. Not magically. They're all, they're all Europeans that live there. I inbreeding rates in Israel vary by population group. But the highest rates in the, say that Arab Bedoin population. You guys are close to the Bedoin, but that's the a not far off. Right? Israeli Arab. Israeli Arab. Okay. So Jewish population is only 2.3%. Yeah. The Palestinians is like 40. Look at that. Israeli Arab population is 25 9%. Not close. Wow. But that's a crazy number. But look at the Bedoin population.


It's 44%. Damn. Damn 20. Wait, what's, what's 25.9% up? Look at that. 44%, which is high and has resulted in a high prevalence of genetic disorders and infant mortality. And don't you love, don't levels Ai. This is what I love about ai. It has to tell you sometimes. Yeah, it, they catch it when you ask it questions like this on a giant podcast before they catch it. Like it gets out there. AI goes, yeah, fucking, and AI just Tells you. And we're like, okay. Facts. Everybody is like, oh my God. Like what? What did they say? We didn't say shit. We read something off the fucking ai. That's what we did. We're talking about real data. Yeah. Oh yeah.


But that's the thing. It's like people that live in liberal areas like Silver Lake and the fucking in the East Village, they don't realize that there's parts of the world that are really, really, really fucked up right now. Really fucked up. And you can't make this place like that place. Right. 'cause you won't survive with your blue hair. You won't survive with your fucking nose post. It makes you interesting. That fucking stupid bull ring you have in your nose. You're not gonna Survive. Yeah. That's what they, All the people that kicked outta their neighborhoods. Yeah. You're not gonna gonna survive with yours on Sunday. They them Pronouns. They're throwing you off a roof. Wow. What he throwing off a roof. And So it's like the rich kid who's like, fuck you, mom, but you got it made kid.


Yeah. You know, I'm going downstairs. Meanwhile, The migrant kid's like, I love you, dad. Don't Leave. I think we need to take an opposite approach in this country instead of like letting All the fucked up people in. What we need to do is like spread the good. Like buy All the other countries, like slowly like Greenland, start with Greenland, Cambodia. Then we buy Mexico's Canada, Guatemala's probably for sale. Find other Doctors. Bring them in. You know, he wants to take over the Panama Canal. Fantastic. Let's buy Panama that way. You don't have to worry about taking over the Panama Canal. We'll get Elon involved. I don't mind the canal. That was, man, make a new coin. We built it. We could sell HK to a coin. Well, I think they built it, but we, we paid Him build it.


Did you see the other idea about the Gulf of Mexico? You know, you can't grill drill in the Gulf of Mexico is a law. Is that right? But here's the thing. Change the name to the Gulf of America. Now you can drill change laws. Yeah. Is that why he wants to do it? Yes. I thought I heard. No, that's he wants to change it. And I was like, he Wants to drill an Eighth grade level Gulf Of America. Fifth graders idea of like, that should be Gulf of America. That's I And now you Can drill. And Canada's a a new state apparently. Yeah. It's fucking genius. Trudeau resigned. Yeah. I mean, it's fucking, what he's doing is kind of crazy. He's not even in office yet. And he is like, fuck it, I'm getting outta here. I don't want this fight. But He's not even in office yet. And the, the whole world is like shifting All the, All the social media companies going. We will do it all. Look at What it, look at Facebook.


Look at Zuckerberg Said. He's like the MMA fighter now. Yeah. But they were just doing what the other people wanted. Whoever's in charge, they're like, sure, sure, sure. Yeah. We way, yeah. And now, okay, sure. We'll do it your way. It's a little shift. Make money. We don't care. You're like, are you Gonna flip back if something flips back? Who Are, you keep stealing Data, they're gonna flip back. Well They're, They'll Flip back. I think, I think most people found out about it because of the Twitter files. And then the outrage was so high they were worried about losing in the next election. And I think they realized that probably lost them this election. So when things like that happened, You can, you can, like there was a point in time when during the Obama administration where they were talking about us going to war with Syria. Do you remember that? Oh, 10 times. Yes. We kept saying no. We said we gotta overthrow us out.


And they go, America said no. And then they go, actually we gotta help Asad because of these other people. And America's like, no, we've just done with these. He Made, there was a press conference and the press conference was, and then back to the first one was so rejected. It was so wildly rejected in the public that the, the Pentagon shifted course. And they decided not to attack Syria. It was like a big, big Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was a big thing in the news. We had eight wars going on and they're like, the country was like, we're not doing this one. And Obviously I have a cursory understanding of the entire conflict. I have a very, very SA small understanding of the conflict. But the reality is like, if things get too rejected, if too many people are like, fuck this. Yeah. Well I think that's probably what happened with all this Twitter shit. When they got those Twitter files and they found out that the FBI was suppressing real information.


And then they found out that, you know, when Zuckerberg was on here and he was talking about the, the laptop and they were telling them it's rusting disinformation. And they were telling 'em to, they told them to remove that meme. You know that meme of Leonardo DiCaprio pointing at a television screen. Pull it up in, in 10 years. Like, did you take the Covid vaccine? If so, you may be eligible for a class action lawsuit. And it's like, it's like Le Leonardo decap. It's smoking a cigarette from Once upon A time. Yeah. Yeah. It's a, it's a classic meme. Take that one down. They asked him to take on a man. Clearly. Not really. Do You know the meme? Do you have it Jamie? 'cause I have it on my phone. Great. Me said, By the way, how about Trump and Oh, Biden having a full on hang Fest. Obama.


Yeah. What did I say? How Wild was that? Oh yeah, you're right. Obama. Obama. The black Guy. How, how wild was that to watch though? It Is a little disappointing though. 'cause both those guys benefit so much on every American, on both those sides hating each other. I know. And then you see them together and they're like, ha, we Get along. Well You know what it's like's Like Clinton and Trump at the old parties of like, they're all just friends. They eat at the same dining hall. Yeah. They're all pieces of shit. You know what it's like, it's, it's like the guys fight and then the fight's over and they talk so much shit about each other before the fight. Then they hug, Then they hug it out. They're all emotional. That's what It's like. It's like, come on. Except they're not fighting. They're talking about Yeah, we're professional. Yeah. This is like trying to, the other guy like, this is Hitler and I need to have a Hitler revolution to fight him Hitler. And then High how you Then you get done, you go, Hey man, you see this?


It's so fake On Kamala. He Was saying that neo-Nazis and white nationalists. Yeah. We're very fine. People remember that? Yeah. Yeah. And then he's like, I had to say it. I get it. I get it. You had to say it. Yeah. Yeah. They just sit down and they work It out. But meanwhile the rest of us, my, You know, neighbor to each other has a fucking sciences Real flag. Yeah. Love, Love. You know, black Lives matter. Lives matter. Don't. That's what they're putting out there. Yeah. It's causing division. And you have a Yeah. Joy Division. Well it just makes you realize this is the reason why cults exist. 'cause it's really easy to shift someone's opinion about things. It's really easy. Most people are really weak. Yeah. And they're also all looking at the fringes of each side. 45. So like the shit they're complaining about, like 90% of the people on that side doesn't, they're like, yeah, we agree with you.


Yeah. 90%. Yeah. It's nuts. It's just weird that it works so well. Yeah. It really does work. And people make at their whole personality, their whole identity. And then if you push back, they hate you. He's Hitler. And I'll sit next to him at Carter's funeral and laugh And they joke around together. Meanwhile, Biden's asleep. You see him fall asleep, fell asleep. Couple of them. He Fully fell asleep. There was a picture of like fell asleep. Three or four of them didn't snoozing. But My favorite part, see that was when Kamala Harris shows up and she fucking stink eyes both of them. Yeah. She stink Eyes Trump and Obama and then sits down and doesn't say hi or shake their hands. Nice. And then looks over and sees that Biden or that Obama and Trump are talking to each other. Yeah. And she goes like this. She's like, Yeah, rolls our eyes and Won't go over.


And she's with her husband and her husband's. That's like when Shane was talking to Chappelle or Louie and people were like, fuck, I gotta be nice to you now Bill Clinton was there too. He was checking out Kamala. He is like, Hey, Nice rump In a pants suit. You are half black. I'm gonna go out with A bang. I Watch this. Look at, Look how angry she is. Dude, look how angry she is. It's unbelievable. I mean it's like, look at Obama and Trump just, no one looks at each other's Like you sit next to him. Yeah, That's what she said. Fucking She guided him over. He has to sit wherever the fuck she tells him to. By the Way, he's the white Chris Brown. Look, they're looking at each other. Trump Is like everyone. Maybe we'll shake hands. Everyone Uncomfortable.


Look at Trump. He's just holding it. Bush Together's wife. I wanna be on what she's on right now. Look at Bush's wife. She's so happy right now. She's seeing elves and, but she Knows Jules. She's got The handmaid tail on Milana. Milia. Melania is like, I can't fucking believe I have to be First Lady once again Man. Jimmy Carter. That fucking fentanyl. It'll get you. Yeah. At a hundred. He made it to a hundred though. That's true. Kamala knows she's on camera. So at them, she's gotta act more pissy. But Look at them just too talking. Is that look a honker on that guy in the back. Jesus. That's Gotta be able to hear them. That's a beak. Yeah, that's A lobbyist. What if Trump is just going up? You Can tell by his beak.


Smart cocaine border. And meanwhile he's right near Pence. Pence. Oh, Pence is still bald. I think shook. Hillary didn't Like it. I think he shook hands with Pence. Damn. Which is why, Who does Trump? Yeah. It was Pence like literally called him Hitler. Oh Shit. Almost. That was his vice president Too. Like what did Pence say? What was like the worst thing Pence said about, but Pence definitely said he shouldn't be president. Yeah. And then he won again And Pence that So short. Yeah. Oh fuck. Now you just shut up. Oh, You gotta shut the fuck up and you gotta shake his hand. Mm. You lost Deal with it. I saw Pence announced. I was watching the news live when Pence announced his presidency. It was great. Really? It's like on Hannity, he was a guest on Sean Hannity. Yeah. They did it.


Like they, he was about to announce and they were like, we gotta take a commercial break. Then he comes on, he is like, I'm gonna run for president. There's like 12 people on bleachers. Like, bro, you got you lost. Damn you Just the numbers. I Can't, I'm still On the fence. Did you ever see the conversation he had with Tucker Uhuh when Tucker was talking about the problems that America has? And he said, that's not my concern. Oh. Did you ever see that? It was I've seen it. No. And I, I I feel for Pence on this one, that was, it seemed like a misstep. Oh it was. He just said the wrong, he phrased it wrong. Yeah. But it's the worst thing. You could possibly, What was about to say freeze. This Is what he did. He reacted to an attack. So the attack was on him. Yeah. And so his reaction, 'cause he's a guy who likes to be in power.


That's not my concern. Like his reaction is to shut you down The American people. So he said, it's not my concern. That's not my concern. Like he's, he's trying to shut him down. But he's doing it in a stupid way. Yeah. He's trying To exert his authority. I was the vice president. Let me tell you how it works. Yeah. That's not my concern. My concern is, Yeah, these guys, Shit, after he said it, he probably was like, shit, He's too religious. That guy PE pence. Yeah. He was obsessed with no abortion. And you know, He got made fun. 20 than my wife. I do. I don't mind that. That's a nice what? Gay conversion. He was like, I'm not going to dinner with a lady unless my wife's there. And everyone was like, what are you sexist? I was like, no, that's a, I don't want somewhat Valid Elevator with one.


Especially in his business. Yeah. I mean his business, they're, they're sneaking who in All the time ruin My doctor needs a female nurse in there with them. Yeah. So like, They're sneaking in people to try to like, they have Chinese ladies who are banging these dudes and they turn out to be fired how quick really they turn out to be. How would you not, you get a nine and a half on an elevator with you and all of a sudden she just on her knees and you're like, oh fuck we're doing. We're doing it old.

That story in the lobby. We were too drunk to make it to the mats. The Best point, the best part though is you guys are going at it like crazy and Carl is just like Every Minute of it. That's Literally like pretending to drive a car when there's a car right next to you. Right? Like we were like, nah, we cant make it into the math. It's too far. That's like 20 steps away. Yeah. That's too far. It's like when you fuck a girl in the bathroom, the bed's right there.


But you couldn't hold it. Yeah. But that's fun. Something exciting. That's, let's see. The sink can do. Yeah. Let that sink In. Sink. Sink can hold you up. But if it doesn't, that's a real problem. Right. The sink can breaks. I've had a few, That's why I never get up there. When a girl takes me to the bathroom, I never jump on the sink. I've pissed in the sink at least a thousand times in my life. Oh yeah. How many times do you piss in the sink? Oh Yeah. More often. Yeah. I pissed in the sink many times. There's A lot of people don't Like that. They Don't need to know. You run the water. I Like it. Yeah. They don't need to love it. I love, I like it. I piss in the shower every time I get in the shower. Same, Of course. Every Time I went to, oh yeah. Every Time. My House in Philly. Every time.

I think I might be one of, He's white groundskeeper. Gary. The best thing about pissing in the shower is when you don't even acknowledge that you're pissing. Like you're just washing yourself and peeing at the same time. You let it fly. Yeah. God. It feels good. Yeah. Like, like our ancestors used to do. They used to just pee. They didn't hold it in. Oh. Why would they hold it in? But even a Dog like bends the shower, you're just like, yeah. Letting it fly. So nice. Yeah. Pee in your own backyard. Feels good. You feel like an American. I Pee my own outside. Whenever I take my dog out to PI pee.


It's nice. Oh yeah. I pee All the time outside. That's nice. You got it. You got it. It still counts. You usually have like half a second delay. It's like the five second rule. You drop food. Yeah. Oh, that five second rule really helps When You're hungry. I just think about All the, as that Norman's eating and think about how ridiculous it would be to not eat food off the ground. Facts. Yeah. You gotta do it. He ate, Eat fucking leftovers at Restaurants. Yeah. I ate yours when you went to the bathroom. Why not at breakfast? Norman just would seed like at the cellar stuff coming back. And he goes, whoa, whoa. Well I'm Telling you. Gimme that. It Works. This has never not worked for me.

Yeah. They've never questioned it. They just run away. That's so weird. How many times have you done that? Oh Geez. A Dozen. Norman is the biggest joy now. A dozen. That's so crazy. Yeah. Is it because you don't want the food to go to waste? Or you're hungry? Both. Well, I used You have money? I had no money back then. Oh right. Years. But now it's just a rush Years. But now you just do it for the Goofs. And I had no food at my house as a kid. And I think it fucked me up. Oh Yes. Also, it's right there. It's right there. When we were at Bonnaroo and he went, Norma went off to hang out, have some fun somewhere, and then came back.


There was a staff party. Crawfish boil comes back three hours later And it was like, ah. What a crazy night.

'cause back in my day, nobody shaved. It was a, it was chaos. Harry Butley. That's nuts Porn. That's porn's busy. Biggest victory. Porn's biggest victory over culture is shaving a pubic hair. Here. Here. I used to do a joke about it where if aliens came and they were studying the development of the human race, they'd be like, what happened to the pubic hair? Like what happened? There's no documented porn like direction. Nobody told people to do it.


It's not a public health concern. Nobody like issued some sort of a statement that you should start shaving your pubes. Yeah. Right. But everybody, when they started seeing porn, they all started shaving their pubes. Great. Also kind of taught 'em how to give head too. Yes. They're getting a little rowdy with the head. The ladies do to Porn. When they get a little rowdy and they start gagging, Hey, because of porn. Now every girl does that. Right. Hey, Hey, Hey, hey. I've used porn to watch how to eat out. Maybe get some tips. I think they're exaggerating. I was told To our friend Whitney Cummings was explaining How, I never get that Reaction.

And then once people saw people having sex, they're like, let's kick this up A notch. Yes. Fired. I like that part. Yeah. Why don't you tie each other up? Why don't you do this?

I got him in a choke hold once he Got him in A choke hold. Funs. It's just funsies. But look at the, look at the arms.


Look at the tits. Pretty big. Look at the thighs. Weak ass. Compared to lot of dudes. I am. There's, that's the thing. There's a lot of dudes I know that can fucking murder me easy. See the problem? That's What's uncomfortable about being around the UFC. Like Yeah. Too many murders. You get delusional. Yeah, I know. 135 pound dude that could fucking take your life. What was up with that last fight with a herb? Dean kept calling it, he kept being like, stop work. Work. And you're like the O'Malley fight. Yeah. I don't know what was up with that. Yeah. I Don't wanna get the guy In trouble. No. I mean, I think he's getting instruction from someone Ah, stand who's telling him stand to keep the action moving. Yeah. When fighters go to the ground and they're not doing anything, keep the action moving.


I think, I don't think that's herb's call. I think someone's directing him. Because one of the things that Herb, and I think, by the way, I always say Herb is the gold standard. Yes. Great. As good a referee as ever existed. He's like, there's him, there's Mark Goddard. There's a few guys that are like right up there that are like elite of the elite. Like, you see them refereeing a fight. Like they're gonna, they're gonna handle it. It's gonna be perfect. It's just like you, you know, it's a tense job. Yeah. And if people are breathing down your neck saying to keep the fights moving, you know, what's, he said something to the, something along the lines of, if someone would like me to just let them fight out on the ground, no matter what I, I wish someone would tell me that. Mm Wow. So that means that someone's probably told him Yeah.


To keep the action moving. That sucks. They Want Yeah. They want it to be more entertaining. They hate Those fights. You know who probably told him that? That's white. Oh yeah. He hates, he hates a, a fight like that where there's no action. The guy just takes the guy down and hits little punches. He hates that shit. Even if you're winning. He wants guys to go for the finish. He wants guys to fucking brawl. He wants it to be exciting. Yeah. I guess he wants it for them too. He's like, look, you wanna make money in this sport? You gotta leave the fans wanting to see you fight again. Yeah. And that's true. And the difference between a guy who's a champion who you know can make good money versus a guy like Conor McGregor is, Conor McGregor gets people excited about seeing him fight.


He puts asses in seats. He knocks people unconscious. So when you see that guy fight, you know you're gonna see some wild shit. Either he is gonna win or he is gonna lose. But it's gonna be a fucking braw. It's guy's never been in a boring fight in his life. No. That's He knows. He knows how to promote. He knows how to promote. Dad simply beat up that old guy. That guy didn't really Deserve that guy. Yeah. That guy swallowed that punch too. Yeah. Well it was not much of a punch. It was more of a A smack. Yeah. A little. I did as smack. A little smack. Who The fuck is that guy also? That guy probably had I give him a smack. That guy you hit probably had a drunk chin at dub. Oh Yeah. Oh yeah. So like a pub in Dublin. Yeah. Pipe 70 years old. That guy must, He'd been knocked around a million times. Hey, I remember.


Whoa. Those Irish people. But they're still fighting, Bro. I was reading about France, get the Bris up. World War I and World War War ii. France lost 25% of their men in World War I and another 25% in World War ii. 25%. 25%. You guys watch the Chamberlain thing on Netflix? It's great. What? Never Is it On Chamberlain It, yeah. Yeah. The the British guy. Oh, Churchill. Churchill. Oh, what did I say? Chamber. I knew that Wasn't right. Yeah. But that was the guy before him. Oh, sorry. He figured it out though. Thank you Norman. Nor Norman. But yeah, the, the Churchill doc is incredible sipping. This is gonna change. Ron Howard did it. Yeah. They bombed the shit out of Dresden.


Dresden. Is that right? Yeah. Okay. They just bombed like killing civilians. Like, like the IDF. It was Slaughterhouse five. That's Kurt Vonnegut. Dresden a good, that's right. It's a good time. It's kind of crazy when you think about how that was not that long ago. No. These people lost 50% of their men. Wow. Yeah. Fuck Man. Isn't that wild? Fuck. And now we have people doing it again. They're saying let's do it again. And they would just bomb London randomly. Like Hitler was like, oh, you're gonna push back on me. Just go blow up buildings. And They knew the codes. They couldn't say, let's stop these like bombing. Because then they'll know we have the codes. Yeah. They tried to like try to evacuate the right people at the right time. Crazy. They were sleeping in the, in the subway.


What does it keep calm and carry on? Yeah. Yeah. Whoa. But then the FDR kinda shit on Churchill. Yeah. And then he, well, playing games, made friends with Stalin who was a big fucking liar. Well what was the, I just watched it. It's not Ano You would know this better than most. Yeah. DeStefano was trying to explain this. When him and Giannis were on that Churchill had a wild idea to invade Russia. I think at the end of the war. At the end of the war. I think at the end of the war it was Churchill. He, he recognized the Soviet Union was like a, a major problem. They got rid of Churchill as soon as the war ended. Yeah. Basically. He wasn't a peace time Guy. I think He lost after that. Even after he won the war.


He lost the, the new Election because he wanted to, he wanted to fire it up again. I think he wanted to fire it up again. I think Patton that's was ready to go. Yeah. Into the Soviets, Christ and Eisenhower. There was a lot of people that went, yeah, it's Batman versus Superman. They're like, you can't allow this guy unchecked. You can't allow Russia uncheck Operation. Unthinkable. That's not a good title. Two related possible future war plans developed by the British Chiefs of Staff Committee against the Soviet Union during 1945. The plans were never implemented. The creation of the plans was ordered by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in May, 1945. And developed by the British Armed Forces Joint Planning staff in May of 1945. The end of World War II in Europe. One plan assumed a surprise attack on the Soviet Union or Soviet forces stationed in Germany to impose the will of the United States and the British Empire Upon Russia, the will was qualified as a square deal for Poland.


But added that does not necessarily limit the military commitment. The assessment signed by the Chief Army staff on ninth June, 1945 concluded it would be beyond our power to win a quick but limited success. And we would be committed to a protracted war against heavy odds. The code name was now reused instead of, instead for a second plan, which was a defensive scenario. Don't throw it. That's Crazy. Don't, Don't, don't throw. Don't do it. I don't trust Bud. Do it. Alright. Defend a Soviet drive towards North Sea Atlantic. Ocean withdraw American forces from the continent. Jesus. That's fucking terrifying. Yeah. That's terrifying. It was Huge. It, it was.


These Motherfuckers love War. Oh yeah. That's their Business. The Soviet Union was Yeah. Evil. Well also they lost a lot of people during the war and they were a little bitter about That. And they knew they were about to get the nuke. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. And it was like, now America's the only one with the nuke. And they got a bunch of those rocket scientists from the fucking Oh, that was the Deal. And if we get it done now we're the only ones that ever have the nuke. Right. The crazy thing was the rocket science. They're Like, listen paper, Listen, I know you're a Nazi, but who knows? We need it. We Don't care. Come on over. What's The, what's the lady that wrote the Jacobson? Annie Jacobson, Ann Rice. I just listened to paper clips.


Aaron Rice. I just wrote the, or I just listened to the paperclip book and it's terrifying. Terrifying. The nuclear one's, the scariest, The nuclear one's the terrifying one. Operation paperclips crazy too. 'cause she delves deep into those things. Yeah. But the, the nuclear one's like, oh my God. This Is the Russian version of it. Ooh. A secret Soviet operation in which more than 2,500 German specialists, scientists, engineers, technicians who worked in several areas from companies and institutions relevant to military and economic policy in the Soviet occu occupation zone of Germany and Berlin, as well as around 4,000 more family members totaling more than 6,000 people were taken from former Nazi Germany as war reparations to the Soviet Union War reparations humans.


Yes. It took place in the early morning hours of October 22nd, 1946, when MVD previously NKVD and Soviet Army units under the direction of Soviet military administration in Germany, headed by Ivan ov, rounded up German scientists and transported them by rail to the USSR Ooh, by rail. Wow. Wow. Yikes. They didn't have any use for those Much related equipment, was also moved. The aim being to literally transplant research and production research centers as well as a V two rocket center of middle work from Germany to the Soviet Union and collect as much material as possible from test centers such as a lo wafa center, mil Central Military Aviation test Center at, say that word.


What's that word? Tel Tel Rocklin Lin, taken by the Red Army on 2nd of May, 1945. Fuck. What type of German goes and works for the goddamn Soviets? Nazis. They're Taken away. I mean, say what you will about national socialism, but at least it's an ethos. That's good point. You're gonna get trouble. That's a, it's from the big bobowski. Oh, okay.

Okay. The, the whole fucking Nazi scientist thing is wild. Yeah. They just accepted those guys. You go to Alabama, it's all Braun. That guy Braun built everything out there. It was An asset. Spaceships asset. Yeah. It was like gold. It was like golden land Nazi. Like, like that kind of thinking was like, yep. Yeah. Yeah. We need the gold. Yeah, we need the Nazis. Bring the scientists over. What Town is that in Alabama. It's got a club there. Huntsville. Huntsville. Huntsville. That's it. It's all Nazi down there. It's all, It's Hilarious.

They had that rocket factory in Florida that was run by a satanist, A Houston rocket. Yeah. Yeah. An open Satanist during the middle of the whole fucking rocket development program. What? Yeah. This guy was, he ran this place that's now like one of those haunted places where people go to visit and they, if you go there, there's like spray paint all over the place and like devil signs and shit. Oh, Nice. People have gone there and like tried to find ghosts. Jack Parsons. Jack Parsons. Wow. So this guy get an article on him. Oh yeah.

Is the first time fucking freak him. Whack off you idiots. Well let the guy cook. Let him cook. Let, let. Brilliant people are all twisted. Look at, look at Diddy. Back then, all those scientists were getting crazy pussy. They were all wild freaks. They were, they were banging their graduate students. Oppenheimer. Oh yeah. They were all banging everybody.

They wanted to be like intellectually famous and be like the big man on campus. They be new. All the ladies loved. Yeah. That guy. New Degra. It's still happening now. It's still happening now.


All these guys become Elon. All the scientists. Elon's got a lineup, but he's got 74 children. Kids, they just Weren't, weren't fucking because they couldn't. And now that they can have Instagram accounts, they're Fucking, yeah, they're probably fucking good point. Oh yeah. Neil Degrass is up. Uranus. Yeah. Hey, a lot of black holes. Oh Jesus. Quasars.

Really? If you missed it, you missed it. Wow. Yeah. And it looked Like a UFO. It looked like an SUV with lights on it on the bottom. And propellers. What was the shape of it? Kind of a, sorry. A little semen like, you know, kind of like a rectangular black rectangular with lights on it. And You could see the propellers. Oh yeah. Wow. But they were quick. They were moving. The thing about these things is they're able to stay up in the sky for five hours at a time. Five Hours. They only got my nephew for bar mitzvah at 30 minutes. Yeah. That's most of the ones that we have in America. What? I didn't get that. The drone Nephew mitzvah. Even full of Mitch McConnell.

Well, Well Trump said he is gonna say what they were, but then it kind of fizzled. Just Say it. Well he said they know what they are. And when I get into office, it's one of the first things that I'm gonna disclose to the American people. Yeah. What do you think it is? I heard they're, they're missing weapons. What? Or something heard. I heard that one. That they were, they were scanning the sky. They were looking for a radioactive signal. There was some guy that was a drone manufacturer in America. We played his video and he was saying that they do have the capability to look for gamma radiation and that there was a, a nuclear warhead that was unaccounted for.


Yes. And that they were worried that someone slipped it into the country. But that's, we've been diving down that rabbit hole. It doesn't seem like that makes sense. Mm. All of them be doing that. And why not just say that's what they're doing? Yeah. I don't know. Because then people would freak out. They Always go with that mass hysteria reason. I never buy it On. Well here's other thing. Catch on too. If they don't have to tell you, why would they tell you they don't want to, but because it just makes more work for them. This Isn't mass hysteria. I guess it's not. It's not. Yeah.

You know, there's shit blowing up in Syria. An election. Oh, things are happening left and right. Syria. Syria. Like they, they lost their government. Oh my God.


It's All like That guy fled like, like Ellen. He died. They killed. Right. We're trying to figure out if he's, his plane blew up. We heard his plane blew up, but we heard it didn't. Did you See this Went off the radar? No. What is, When Tim pull, she says they're gonna do disclosure and that there's two kinds that they, that they don't know what it is. Well click on that shit because this is Shane's girl. Lemme play a shorter one. He loves her. Oh, she is pretty Unexplained. What's The company? Full screen Arrow. It's a government agency that investigates UAPs. They investigate a lot of other things as well. But they'll be doing this. I am told this, starting this year. Oh. And all my senators in a gamer chair. Videos and photos. That's where you know, things are Good. And they will explain how they've been debunked. I've been briefed on this. And then some of the ones that are unexplained, they will also release to the public.


They're also going to, that's What sort of, I didn't, I didn't know what the hell that meant. Huh? What'd she say on this one? A Classified information. You can't talk. Is that, That's interesting. Drone. Why are you skipping ahead? Because They're giving their idea And what, what they think it is. And she just Mark which she's the one From Saving time. Lemme hear what she says. Pro The government is gonna start putting out some of the information on which ones are that they have debunked and how they debunked them. 'cause I think that information would give more trust in the process too, with the government. 'cause I don't trust them. I don't, I don't trust at this point any government agency. 'cause we've been lied to for so long by all of them. But, but then while they do that, they're also going to release information on what is unexplained.


What's the Company Arrow? It's a government agency that investigates UAPs. They investigate a lot of other things as well. But they'll be doing, be doing this. I am told this, starting this year, starting over the next couple months, start releasing information on videos and photos that they have debunked and they will explain how they've been debunked. I've been briefed on this. And then some of the ones that are unexplained, they will also release to the public. So I think that's, that's a great first step in some transcript. Have you, have You ever met any of the Arrow? Beautiful eyes. Old Macy.

Keep it rolling. I, I'm gonna get another beer at this joke has to come out before I, it's a chess move. I don't even want the ice. I just wanted to say it. That's ice. How's the border looking? That's ice. That's ice. Yeah. Think about being like hiding.


Be like, shit, there's spotlights and one guy going, that's ice. You see the one guy that they arrested in California, they arrested him. He had a blowtorch in his hand. Jesus course. The neighborhoods, the neighbors arrested him. The neighbors grabbed him. They called the cops. They arrested the guy and then they let him go. Damn. I Know. He had no evidence that he was doing it. I read They didn't let him go. He just didn't get charged with arson. He got charged. He didn't do it yet. Something else. He a fucking torch. His was Thinking about It. Well, he was an illegal, he'd already did. He is this guy, the guy that had been deported already and came back in. That was the guy who lit the lady on fire on the subway. That's right. He kept coming in and out. He, yeah, he had been deported. The, The fact that there's the, the guys that are doing this are illegal immigrants.


It's very funny to like work your way, the whole way to get here and then, and then just settle a lady on fire. Well, you're acting like it's hard to get in here. How about set Palisades? You're not really, it's pretty hard to fucking get in Here bro. For some people. But I think a lot of people are just, Well, how many people died in the Palisades fire? And that was arson A hundred, 200 Instead charged with felony probation violation. Her investigation remains active. No, that's, oh, She's cho. That could be Cho Dominic. Dominic Choi Is her name Dominic Dominique? No. No. It's, That's, I think that's a, who's that Lady? A Neighbor. She was citizens' arrest. So she made the citizen's arrest. Res Renata. Yeah. Cramp Granada, bro. She goes down, They've got video of people lighting the fires.


Yeah. They've Got video from this sky. Are these copycats now that everyone's just trying to do it? I Don't know if it's organized or not because the way they're doing it is very clever. So they're doing it in the correct place that you would start a fire if you wanted to wind to blow straight through the Palisades. God, I need those people around Camping. It doesn't, not like an idiot who just lights a fire that's like near it. They're riding a fire with the wind, blowing the exact direction. And they did it in specific strategic locations. If it's all arson, it was done very strategically because like the way it burned through the city, the fucking videos are insane On the hill too. The way it, it lights up on a hill. It just like, it just goes so Fast. Wind. There's a hundred mile an hour winds. Ari, like trucks fell over on the highway. You see the, the highway?


No. Like people were driving by the highway and there was fucking 18 wheelers just tipped over all over the place. What? Yikes. Yeah. That's how bad the wind was. This One says the guy, he said he was trying to smoke weed. Oh yeah. With a blowtorch. I mean that's how they do it now. I heard It was a butane torch, which He couldn't afford. A lighter. Hey buddy. A blow torch is more, more Expensive than A fucking lighter. I didn't see, I just, It was, it wasn't a blow torch, but it was like a Say you couldn't afford a lighter, you can go into a restaurant and get lighters for free Or just light it off a house. No, you need a torch to do dabs. Yeah. If you're a dabs guy, you need a torch. Ah, He's a dabber. He's coming from Mexico to dab in America. Well Louis is from Puerto Rico. That's America. Yeah. Good point. Sort Of It's America. You don't pay taxes and you can't vote. Oh Shit.


Yeah. A lot of guys go over there. You know. That's the scam. That's like the Peter Schiff scam. Whoa. You go over there. If you live there like 51% of the time or whatever it is. Like there's some number. You don't pay taxes. So you don't pay federal income taxes and you can't vote. Is that why the Paul brothers are chilling? I don't need to vote. Oh yeah. Are they They're big Buckeye fans. Yeah. Ah, You got A lot. Yeah. That's why they go over there. Yeah, they go over there for tax reasons. Oh. It's like a Swiss bank. Like Peter Schiff talked about it on my podcast and a bunch of fellas hopped on that bandwagon. He Was like, oh nice. I'll do that. Yeah. 'cause like he was explaining why you should do it. That's kind of why we're in Texas. He's Why we're in Texas instead of Woodland Hills, Texas. Yeah. Listen, Texas' very high property tax. Yeah. Like you wind up paying. That's why you rent. You wind up paying.


Yeah. If you wanna rent, you can do it. Yes. Florida no income. Yeah. Here too. Same too Here too. Oh really? No. Income tax. Yeah. Whoa. Yeah. But we're saying that like property tax, you didn't No. Where The fuck do you think we all moved to? Yeah. That was the reason I Thought you just love Tony. Yeah. You want flying cockroaches. Flying Cockroaches. They have those here. Yeah. That's a lot of Christians here. That's Christ. Yeah. Good guy. You killed bro. Right? When we thought we're over, That's Christ is great. That's a Classic. I'm upset that I haven't got one in here. Man. Come On, Rogo. You gotta think. Ah, plan ahead. There's not a lot of those words left. Yeah. Start rhyming in your head. That's what you think.


They're out there when it Comes up. I thought that was a lead up. Oh, I Was like, I was watching this video with this lady who is in the middle of surgery and she gets a call from United Health seeing if the person who is undergoing surgery needs to stay over. Why does a person need to stay in the hospital? She's in the middle of doing surgery and she does this video. She goes, okay. I was just in the middle of surgery. I had to stop, scrub down, take off my stuff, answer the phone. 'cause UnitedHealth was trying to figure out if the person who I'm operating on right now needs to stay. Why they need to stay in the Hospital. You can't just get an A system to do it. They just try to Fuck you. You. Yeah. Insurance is out.


This is why I don't have any. Well, here's the thing about the Palisades. The Palisades is gonna be crazy because they're not wrong. They, a bunch of those insurance companies, they stopped fire insurance. Yeah. They all bailed off. Exactly. Yeah. So it's like how, how many of those houses are ever gonna get rebuilt? Oh, who has the money? Well, The Hiltons, So they'll be bailed out to still be crooked. Well, here's what's probably gonna happen. A bunch of people gotta step in and offer them pennies on the dollar for the land because they don't have anything anymore. And no one wants to be there anymore. And you can't afford to rebuild. There's gonna be a ton of people that can't rebuild. Yeah. Take the money that you get insurance and just Get out. Then you rebuild. So, so let's say you rebuild, you spend a few million dollars to build a fucking house there.


And then you can't get fire insurance on that House. And the next year it happens again. What if it happens again? It happened in 2018. It happened just six years ago. Remember those crazy videos where they're going up to 4 0 5 and it looked like, oh yeah, Armageddon. I Heard a lot of it was because the last two years was so flushed. They called off the drought in LA for the first time. 20 years. Yeah. And they go, so there was so much sru that size that died. Those died. And then now that's all like burning. Yeah. Well they didn't clean it up. Right. They didn't clean it up. And the fucking reservoir was empty. And Then the utilities reservoir, The like 11 million gallons was just sitting there empty. Damn. The whole thing is so mismanaged and so insane. And then on top of that arson and then also That Those wins and the way they deal with crime, the people that it was climate, climate change, the, the fucking climate hasn't changed since 1877.


They've never had wet. We got good rain two years. It filled up everything. And they were like, great. The drought is over. Scientists called the drought over in LA for the first time since I've lived there. I remember that. And it was like, nice. And then that made a new problem. They didn't do anything. Well, here's the thing about raining. When it rains, then it means more vegetation. Right? So, and then when it dries up after the rain, you're extra fucked. 'cause now you have extra dry shit. Get a two month dry period. You're fucked. Yeah, Dude, I got evacuated three times. I've been there. Yeah, I've been there Where? Where? The fucking two houses in front of my house burnt to the ground. How about my neighbor's house survived. My house survived. But like on our street, there was like four or five houses that Were gone. Dude, I was in Cuba when they had to e evacuate people. Me and Bobby there. Hurricane came. It was so orderly. Really?


They had three people rushed to the hospital. That was the only pro, A pregnant lady and two old people. That was the only problem, had these Hurricanes All The time. But these are hobbles. The Red cross goes door to door, says you come, you come, let's go. And everyone just goes, Red Cross does It? I think so. That's what he said in Cuba. Maybe I'm wrong. I think so. Interesting. But Then they just go to door to door, like, let's go. But they've already mapped out which ones have to be evacuated. Like you're going to a gymnasium. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Everybody's completely forgotten about North Carolina. I know. They got seven 50. The thing about two assassinations es Epstein Island. It goes away. Trump assassination attempts. Like everything. It just goes Away. The fucking news cycle's so fast now. I know. It's our brains are are Scattered. It's so scattered toed.

Yeah. It's, you can, it's possible you could have a champion that came from a wealthy family, but I don't think I've ever seen it. You know, It's impressive about Tyson. A champion His life. Yeah, I know. But like, The real killers come from C Christian McCaffrey running back. His dad was an NFL guy. Yeah. Grand Hill helps. He grew up Grant too. But he grew up with like a, a dad that was like, this is how you play football. Right? Yeah. Right. It made him a, a freak. I don't know. I think in football it can work. I think football's a little different than fighting though. For sure. Because in football there's a thing, the the, you know, there's a play. It goes down. You do your best. You're not like duking it out in the fucking fifth round where your leg is imploding and your, your liver's bleeding and your fucking, your ears are ringing and you're still trying to win.


Like Yeah. That takes a specific type of Yeah. It's different poverty In your background. It's just fight growing up. But what if you got like a tutor for fighting since you were five? You know, these kids are getting juujitsu classes. Aren't that wonder? Boy, I think that's where I think that I could be wrong. It could be where the sport heads To rich kids where Like people with a train, but boxing never did. But poor kids are gonna train too. And they're gonna be angrier to Get a fucking, But if you start training jitsu like five years old, jts is different. You're gonna be, is different master at it at 18. Jits is different. Just Jits is different. 'cause you're not getting hit. But like, Boxing, boxing never, Never got that. Like, That's why there's no, I mean now there's some white boxers, but like, Well you got, got like Tyson Fury, who's a fucking gypsy. He was a gypsy.

I don't believe him Says another guy. He might come back. Like if they offer him the Anthony Joshua fight. I know they talked about that, didn't he? Didn't he retire before? Is that Bruce?


Joshua? No. Tyson F Yes, he did. Yeah. He, he retired when he was having real mental health problems. Mm. He, he like almost committed suicide. Dude. Tyson almost drove his Ferrari off a bridge.

That's Crazy. And they both saddled up to go to war too. Yeah. It was pretty sad. So did Lo Chenko. Yeah, he saddled up too. Whoa, look at that guys. He's the mayor of Keef. Yeah. So what was his, he's the what? Vi. So Vitale's the mayor. So Vladimir, what is Vladimir's position? What does he do? It's just so Vitali iss the mayor of Kyiv.

That's crazy. That was worse than the Duke Lacrosse team. So this is a new sport where you're allowed to punch in the face. That's true. Because this was never the case in any other sport. Like if this is basketball, they would've stopped this a long time ago.


Yeah. Oh yeah. It's so they're letting guys box. 'cause this is different too, because you have shoes on so you can get grip and movement. Yeah. And you can really punch hard. Yep. The thing about hockey is like you're hampered. You fall fast. Yeah. Yeah. You're flop. Flopping around in fucking skates. But he was probably disqualified forever after that. I don't know man. You're allowed to do that. Fought. Yeah. It looks like you're allowed to do that. 'cause the referees didn't jump in the Ref's. True. It's a penalty. But Bro, that changes sports.

I'm gonna pee for the third time. I did the wait the third time. That's the race. That's a new one. That's the one you were waiting on.

I just did a Something's burning. That show's still going. How's it? Well, It's about LA now. It's doing great. Now that it's free. Sorry. Now that it's free. Yeah. The, the shackles. It was in that Story. Contract disputes. Nuts. Nuts. That story is from Bert to tell, but for us to go, what the fuck? Wait, what? Yeah. We can't talk about The but All Right. Jesus. Off be air. We'll tell you the whole story. Oh, no. And you'll about this go What?


Fuck. Business Fucking sucks. What do you think is cool? Sucks. It doesn't have to be that Man. Doesn't have to be, It doesn't have to be that one you're good At. You're good at like, Thank you. Let's make it cool. Let's everybody pass around money the way you should It's supposed to be. Oh, everybody should be fine. Have a good time. Let's all fun. Have fun together. It's not But that's not how it is. Everybody wants it. All. They want the giant chunk of it. You know, we were talking about the the other day, we were talking about festivals. Yeah. You know, these festivals, they'll sell, you know, tickets for a giant arena and they'll take a giant chunk of All the money and they have all these comics up, but everybody's there to see the comics. Yeah, but you're, you are making a, well, we have employees.


Right. Well, why do you have employees? Like, what is this? Okay, good. What is your business? Your business is like selling other people's art at a co a cut rate. Right. 'cause you get 'em all together because they're all here. Like, it doesn't make any sense. But you know what it led to the way cab drivers were so shitty. That led to Uber. Yes. That led to Bert's tour. Ah, right. Bert's like fun festival tour. Right. 'cause I just running it myself then cut you guys out. They Offered me one of those once And it was, it was like so ridiculous. You Did want to Toronto. Which one? I think you did. JFL 42. Uhuh. No, I, my headline just there. No, it was the JFL was going on and I did an arena. I did it like with them sort Of. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. But It wasn't the same thing.


It wasn't like what they do. Because what they were doing was like, you would go and do one of those big shows with all these names on it and they would give you like, let's just say a number like X. Yeah. And I was like, but how many of these people are coming to see me? And like, oh, you gotta put my name on the thing. Exactly. And you're gonna take, and you're gonna give me a tiny amount of money in comparison to what I would make if I did the show. And I could just do a show like this doesn't make any sense. And it was all because they have employees. Like why? Yeah. But then they went under. There You go. Oh yeah. Yeah. 'cause it's like you can't, that doesn't make any sense. Risk management funds too sucks because You get to a certain point when you're selling tickets. Like, why would I not sell? Why would I not make money when I'm selling tickets for you?


It doesn't make any sense. But Is there a thing where sometimes you do a fest and the fest helps you sell Tickets? Yeah. Maybe when you are coming up. Yeah. Right. Oh yeah. But once you already can sell out big places and they're asking you to sell out a big place, but they want the money. Like, what are you talking about? This doesn't make any sense. There's like five people on this show that can sell at a 10,000 seat arena. Right. And they're all getting a fraction of the money. And you guys are getting most of it. It's like, there's a bunch of those things that happen. And without names. Like the South by Southwest was the craziest one. They offered to have me come down And you know what they're gonna give me? They're gonna give me free tickets to watch the other shows. I'm not bullshitting. What about drinks? I'm not bullshitting. No, That's south by. No, That's south by. Damn.

Nah, Running around to Sinatra's daughter now We've gotten All the way there. I got one. We went All the way around. Article from 2021. Whoa. 2021. $15 million. Not that much for them. Of the 243 gender reassignment surgeries performed on military personnel since 2016. 1650 of them took place between 2016 and December 31st, 2017. And 193 occurred from, must be January 1st, 2018 to December 31st, 2019. Now through the, the first two years that President Donald Trump announced via Twitter that he would bar transgender individuals from serving in the US military.


J Big Dave Smith has the best idea about that bite. Him saying transgender shouldn't be the military and All the liberals like, how dare you. He goes, oh yeah. Right. 'cause your stance should be transgender should also kill unarmed people in the Middle East. Yeah. He goes, how about just don't kill. Right. Yeah. You guys are getting it wrong. It's just weird If they're paying for their surgeries. Yeah. Are their surgeries paid for by the military? I out if that's the case. Oh, of that 15 million, you missed that stat. Yeah. 3.1 was surgeries and 11.9 was, or 11.3 was psychotherapy. Oh. Oh, interesting. Which is also made up Gobby gook. It's Trying to talk him outta it. Pentagon spent $11 million. Look at this.


Pentagon has spent $15 million in the past five years to treat 1,892 transgender troops. How much is that per troops? How much did they pay for the regular troops? Including 11.5 million for Psychotherapy's. 3.1 million for surgeries. That s That's wild. They did pay for the surgery. That's wild. Removal of breast testicles, hysterectomies and labioplasty.

Could happen. It's Just report. I think it over reported. I think young kids growing up in it now are gonna, well the problem is now they have these gender reassignment surgery centers. They're trying to make money and they, they're still open and if they're open they're gonna try to make money. It's like Covid testing Spots.

Now if you go back to like 2007 and see how many gender reassignment surgery centers there were and now in 2024 it's bananas. They just erupted like Starbucks in the nineties. I think the Rea reassignment will end because it's like when they said like, your dick doesn't make you a man. So then like, well you can be a woman with a dick. Right. That's acceptable. So like then just be that. Yeah. Cut off. You have to reas, Some people want to get snipped.

Then I pushed him again. I go, what the fuck are you gonna do? And I pushed him again. I'm like, all right, we're doing this. So I just grabbed the back of his head.

But I was like, okay, if I do this, no one gets hurt.


But if I do this and he hits me, then I have to do something. Yeah. So that was what I did. The Best one I saw live was there was a heckler at the comedy store. Oh, now we're talking Terrible ruin the whole show. Rogan's on. They run him out of there and Joe's just like shots for everybody. He bought the whole place of shot. It was crazy. It was before Like, yeah, when we kicked people out of the comedy store, I would buy the whole audience shots. It got like, I was like A feeling, it was like a bad feeling. I was like, let's just buy everybody shots. Get the energy. The guy in the front patio comes up afterwards and is like, you fucking bitch, I'll do. And the Joe was just so calm. You could just, you read him and you're like, you're not gonna do anything. And the guy was like, I'll fucking, he's like, you won't though. And then I mean whatever.

There was no crowd Murder went down on that patio. Yeah. Like guy got shot. There was no crowd control. And so like there was no security. Like you had wild, crazy people that were drunk outta their ass looking to start fights. And there was no crowd control. The crowd Hook would show up people. That guy ruined the entire show. Yeah. And they never got kicked out. Yeah. The early days of the comedy store were crazy. Yeah. There were so crazy. There was no crowd control. So like a group of drunk guys started yelling at people.


That was the night. Yeah. They yelled at you for the whole night. They ruined the whole Show. And they're like, can someone, Oh, no one did anything. No One did anything. The best Jim Painter was on stage once. He was a door guy. But he was doing a set and then some guy started heckling. He is like, Hey, you keep shutting up. Like I'm gonna, someone's gonna throw you out. He is like, who? He was like me. As soon as they get off. Wow. And then the guy heckled him again. He goes, I'm done. And he just grabbed the guy and pulled him out. Yeah. He's wearing a store shirt. He's like, that's hilarious. That's not my job to throw you Out. It was just so crazy because we had comics that were door people and some of them weighed 18 pounds. Me, You, you said to some guy you had to heckle the main room. And he goes, you gotta go. And then I was like, I guess it's me. And I went over there like 130. I was just starting. And I was like, you gotta go. The guy goes, no.


Oh. Comedy story. It's crazy. Got nothing. There's something about that place that just attracted the most psychotic people. Do you remember the fucking guy that you almost got sued by? Because I said that you were his lawyer. What? The guy was completely schizophrenic. And I told him, Ari's your lawyer, Ari's gonna handle you. And Ari starts saying, as your lawyer, I'd advise you. And so Ari starts giving him my legal Advice. I You said, I'm your lawyer. And then in the convers you called me go, Hey, somebody's gonna call you. You're my lawyer. I was like, what? He's like, wait, somebody's calling me right now. Like go, you're my lawyer. That's With, that is the directive. So Ari came down and was like negotiating like legal points with this fucking completely insane.


Just say that. Two, four, That. And then the guy says he's gonna sue him. So he sends like a legal letter. Oh, I had to actually get a lawyer to help me out. You gotta fight back. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. You know what he sued me for? What? All the riches in the world. Wow. Was on his document. That's pretty Good. That's guy that's, that's how you negotiate. Yeah.

There were so many crazy people there. God, it would just attract the most bizarre people. And we would always talk to them. We'd always be in the back parking lot with like in completely insane people. Complete L No security. You're right on sunset. That was like the heart of a Yeah, it was crazy. It was also the magnet. There was something about that store Made a deal with the devil. Something. And it was just like, that's why they won't burn. It's already been burned. Mm. Something about that place. They tried to kill it with the fucking landslide. They reinforced the wall. I fuck. Keep it up. Oh, there was a a time where the back area was bowing so hard from the ground.


Like it was so close to a landslide. I wouldn't go in that back area. Wow. I was like, Guys, I would tell them when it rains, don't go back here. Yeah. You would see things go p like a little like mini landslide Joint fall. And the thing was bowing. Like they had these big timbers, like these fucking beams, these pressure treated beams. And they were bowing. And I was like, guys, don't be back here. This is how people die. This happens. And I was telling the, the store, I was like, you gotta do something like this. And they're, they're Harsh in my mellow man. They didn't, They didn't wanna spend money. They didn't wanna spend any money. Landslide. I was like, I would not go back there. Landslide. And when I would be back there, if I was feeling paranoid, I would, I would fucking try to be like close to the door.


Like if you heard something you'd have to jo dive through the door. Dang. I was like really thinking about it. They finally fixed that. They fixed it and reinforced the shit out of it. But it was like sketchy. One time it did fall. Remember there's a bunch of chunks that felt Oh yeah. Where the cars park. And then They had, there was a H, not a hurricane, not earthquake one day. Yeah. You get out there. We didn't feel it in there. 'cause it's Satan and you get out like, what the fuck happened out here? Yeah. And we had a little mini landslide back there.

I, I think pro just maybe aggregate the questions. Get your Questions. Some tech guy flying into do the Facebook algorithm. Wow. It's like, I got work to do. Damn. Like I was all excited. The middle seat's empty and then here we go, Fucking With That's Dice. He's fat will be good. But You know, like what a healthy ego you have to have. We have that. We The Dalmatian First guy to ever sell out Masses Square Garden sold it out like a hundred times. And here he is a hundred times talking to people. He sold it a bunch of times. Masses Square Garden.

A bunch of times. Louis Got the record. First time to do it. Yeah, I think so. Dice did it. No one had ever done it. No one had ever done it. And he did it twice right away. And then in the middle of that, in the prime of his fucking career, he releases a two CD set of Embalming. It was him popping up to the club. Yeah. The day the lobster died Club. That's right. You can hear Ice Dangerfield. Yeah. Yep. It was so he was like, how do I follow the biggest album maybe of all time? I go the other way. The other way. Yeah. Yeah.

Oh, well it's just crazy because he's just, you can't believe he's doing it right. Yeah. It's like a Banksy.


But it's, it's crazy. It's, it's his favorite album because he just had the balls in his prime to do something so insane. Like as a piece of performance art. Yeah. Performance art. Weird. He Just doesn't get the credit he deserves because so many people hated on him for a long time. Mm. They hated on him because of his success. They didn't like the fact that this guy was doing nursery rhymes and he was like selling out arenas. They didn't like it. Yeah. They Said misogyny also. They didn't Like he was dirty, but it was, they were looking for excuses. Yeah. Because before that, when he wasn't famous, they all would go see him. They would all see him at the store. They all loved him. Everybody like dices up and they'd all watch him and he would kill. And then he got famous and they're like, what? I don't like what this guy's doing.

And they found some reason why he's, everything that's wrong with comedy, you know, it was just, it was so dumb, man. It was so, it was so weird. That is a bummer. But it's crazy to see people's arcs. Like, look at DYS now. Look at Roseanne now. Oh yeah, sure. What, where, where are we gonna be? Dice Is interesting though.
