I saw her just, I was just watching some of the fights and I saw her just take down Jessica Andra and smoke her. Jesus. She was national camping and she was, and and she's not easy to get down. She's a fucking, She was a Gatorade High school wrestler of the year when she came out. And then she won the Ultimate Fighter. She was a savage. And she got hurt. Wasn't she? National? Yeah. She had a couple of injuries that like derailed her career for a little bit. She Was on the Olympic team, but then got cancer. She defeated cancer. That's right. Cancer. What kind of Cancer? She beat cancer.


Jesus. She's a savage though. So good. We labeled her the Khabib of the women's division. Oh, Here we go. We got something to mix it up with. Oh, LaCroix's. There You go. Oh, There You go. Oh, Alright. That ain sip of this. That's okay. Ow. I'm easy. Thank you man. I appreciate it. Yeah, that's a good fight. Sean. We Lee, she's such a monster man. She's so hard to bet against. But that lady's such an animal. When's the Last time she fought a, a real wrestler? She has not, she's never fought anybody like, like her. Not even close. Neither Of 'em have fought anybody of the caliber that they are. That's why it's a great fight. They're also both older. I think. Tatiana's 31 and then a home girl Ling is what, 34.


Isn't That crazy to say? Because Alex per is 37 Different. Yeah. Isn't it? That's weird though, right? Talking chick bro. Older 31, you start going, Hmm. Isn't that interesting? Especially if lighter Weight class too. Lighter weight class. Yeah. Lighter weight class. Female O like older. They turn into fucking gremlins. How about Fucking Pantoja? He might be, Pantoja is a fucking, He might be the best guy. Pound for pound life. He's a beast. He might be right up there with por and Islam and John Jones and everybody else was in the conversation. But he's small so no one cares. Yeah. Small. Yeah. But God, it damn man. He was so good against that Japanese cat. I was like, my God. And that Japanese cat didn't have that first time jitters. No, he, he came out there like fucking hell. Cat Champion. Hellish Striker One.


Rising. Rising. Yeah. He's fucking dangerous striker. Dangerous striker. So good. But think about they have to sign a homeboy from rising to compete with him. Like there's, there's not much for him. Pantoja iss an animal and he keeps getting better. Like, he looked better in that fight than ever before. His timing and everything was pristine. How old is he? 34 maybe. Jesus. How old is Pantoja? That's rare. Dude. Remember he won the belt. I was like, do you see me now? Dad? Yo. Whoa. Pan. Whatever. Whatever it takes. He's, he's A sweetheart. One of my absolute favorite guys to watch. Fight Monster. Yeah. Just an animal. Just a dog. Just a full beautiful Juujitsu. Beautiful, Crisp, Striking. Yeah. His striking was super impressive Cardio against that Japanese cat.


Because I was like, man, the timing is just so good. There was no place where that guy was safe. You know, He was driving, I think he was doing Uber Eats. Yeah. When he was fighting. He's a sweet guy. Really sweet guy. Crazy. You know. But the narrative on that too, like the media is like, you know, he's a UFC fighter and he's driving for Uber Eats. It's like he also fought once in three years. Like, that's on you dog. Yeah. That's On you. It's, there's a lot of things going on. But it's also weird that 1 25, it's real hard to sell 1 35 no problem. Because 1 25, 1 35 You got sugar Sean, you got Mrab, you Got, you got some stars with personality. But isn't that crazy? But 1 25, every dudes in on the couch is like, they're tiny. I can beat them up. And they have no fucking clue How they not think that about the one 30 fives.


How is it 10 pounds? They're like, ah, okay. Isn't that weird? Yeah, it's weird. Human Nature. Maybe. 'cause you've got some very fucking exciting personalities at 35. What about Mighty Mouse? Rab? Yeah, Bro. Mighty Mouse. Wasm amazing. When he was a champion. Yeah. Amazing. He was doing wizardry. One of the best Ever. He was doing wizardry, wizardry. Wizardry. But, But, but he wasn't controversial. Like he, he was Mighty Mouse, like the nice guy ever, bro. That Ray Borg fight, Dude, I was about to Pl him. Caught an arm All the way down. Yeah. Man, I never seen Like That. He's 34. Yeah, he's 34 Fucking animal. 34 At 1 25. I think 56. There's talk about him going to 35. He, him versus Miab would be fucking bananas. Yeah. But bananas never, I'm Never betting his miab again.


Ever. How, how great was that? How great was that fame? Amazing. Amazing. At Me was amazing. I not sure was gonna beat him. Did you really? You're a piece of shit. Why would you think I'll tell right now? Anyone from Dagestan or that area suck off. He's so good. His wrestling I was To From does Do drives me nuts. Both. They're both from the caucus mountain. They are? Yeah. But one guy trains in Jersey. Like how, what are we doing it? And also Rab has, He's living in Vegas now. He's Vegas. But Rab has the, you know what I'm saying, close I can get, I get Him so Riled up. All right. Justin nuts. Anybody from Ton. I got that customer crush him. Bro. Rab is a machine Thing. The thing is the Biggest weapon in all of combat sports and all of sports, period.


His, his cardio is the most lethal as wrestling thing on the planet. His cardio and his wrestling. And he took A gold medalist, you know, And striking. I mean, You gotta see though, like you look on paper and people were making, they were saying, oh man, well he's got the wrestling the counter and he's got the better hands. Meab, his whole fucking career fought guys with a good wrestling base and fucking good strike. Correct. You know what I mean? He, he's used to that. Who the, who were you gonna get to simulate Meab? Never. Yeah. But you can, he never fought anybody like Meab. I mean this was, I wasn't, we weren't surprised at all. It was it pretty him all. What about, What about against Santo? A gold medalist who's seen it all? Yeah. That was amazing. But the thing about Umar is Umar striking is, is really elite.


Yeah. It's elite and deceptive. He does a bunch of stuff that no one does, right? Like one of the things he does is his crazy front kick to the Yeah. And he throws a, a right leg roundhouse kick and a left leg roundhouse kick to the face. Both of them with like equal dexterity, both off the lead leg. Like he whips that lead leg over your shoulder. Yeah. And smacks guys in the face and his timing. But it Works for him. Keep the pace Timing. No, no one can. Nobody, one can, can never, nobody can keep the pace. No one ever will, the pace You can master a range rab, they think that, oh, he doesn't have the reach. He's the master of closing that distance. He throws that overhand into the single leg that a double leg to, you don't know whether he's shooting or striking the whole time. Right. The whole up. And what I love about it is, after that first round, oh man, ma Rob dropped that round, second round.


He's, he's not getting stressed. You see him smiling, get his back taken, smiling. He's smiling. Ah dude, he's there all night. And he could afford another 25 minutes. I believe it. I never seen anything like it. And I've seen a lot. I don't Think we will either. The way he always like that. He cardio Like that with the cardio. But he didn't have the tools to get outta certain positions. Do You see, did you see what DC said? No. On his Instagram, DC went to visit him. Him the day after the fight. Yeah. And he's running. He's Running. He loves It. So he beats Sugar. Sean wins the world tighter. DC goes to visit him at his house. He's not home. He's running. I'd be running too. So DC is wandering around his house. He doesn't even know he is there. Like, he just lets him, he just walks into his fucking house and he's like filming Maha's gym.


He's like, who's gym? You think this is like this Got a picture, Maha's. It's, it's the best weapon in U ffc. He loves It. It man, he loves, he Loves, there's nothing you can do. He loves to Train. He's, he's incredible. He's, but that's all, that's two things, right? That's some kind of genetic gift. And on top of that insane hard work. Yeah. It's like both the, because the guy's a tank. Yeah. Like a lot of great Gene. It Reminds me of ca remember Kay now that weird cardio? Yeah. Oh yeah. You're like, what the Fuck? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Put his head in your chest and Just They, they said he took two months off and his hey d he took two months off, came in the gym and DC was like, we're gonna beat the shit. I he has been here two months. And he goes, he went Shark Tank rounds and beat the fuck outta everybody. His cardio was fine. Luke Rock. He's like, it's not Luke. Rock Hole told me that Kane was the guy who would turn your fucking head around.


He, he would just get in there and he said at one point he was, he what he was doing to Luke, to Daniel to all those guys was like a different thing. It was a Nightmare. Every, yeah. What changed with Kane was he blew his knee out when he was getting ready for the, or no, no, no, no. Who he before that lost. Who lost to JDS. JDS Junior. Dos Santos. Sorry. Junior. Yeah. I just had a brain fart. Junior Dos Santos knocked him out on Fox and his knee was fucked up going into that fight. And that was the big fight for Fox. It was like one of our first big events. Huge Event. Huge event. And he really shouldn't have been fighting. He should have, he should have got outta the fight. His knee was fucked up. So Junior knocks him out and then he beats The shit Outta Junior in the rematch And he beats the shit Outta Junior in the rematch after that, the third value beat the parade.


I mean he, he beats him like in a way that takes years off your life, Right? Yeah. It changes his DNA forever. His, that pace. He just, you see these guys just Brock Lesner, they can't breathe. They're just wilting from that. Especially That heavyweight. I love that. Smash the Fight. Oh God. A Lot of it had to do with his, he was very good at boxing. He picked up on boxing so Quickly And it was all smooth, smooth technique. There wasn't no big windups where his chin was exposed. It was all very smooth. The Noo, oh my goodness, bad. I fucking bang, bang, bang, Bang, bang, bang. Oh it was like lightning. Just Smooth. I think Kain, I whose prime is the best heavyweight ever. It's hard to say because of Fedor. 'cause if you could get Juicy Fedor from Pride, I think Kain beats the fuck up. I don't know man.


I, I don't know if anybody beats Fedor. Fedor So accurate with his strikes. So good dude. Fedor walked down Cro Cop when Cro cop was in his prime. You gotta remember like most of that fight was standing up and Fedor was going blow to blow with Crow Cop and walking him down. He was very unusual. He that Rman Kea or the Rman arm bar Rman fucking suplexes him on his head. Yeah. And five seconds later he is got him into Kimura. It's crazy. He was different. He was a mo way. He beat up Noguera dude. Oh my God. Watch that fight Again. I'd like to seen some testing around those times. Oh yeah. On all of 'em. But even on the U Ffc back then, even on the U ffc back then though It'd be tough came with that Tim motherfucking Sylvia, when he was Rico Rodriguez, when he beat that shit outta Rico Rodriguez looked like a bodybuilder.


So scary. Cain Kain has Brian Cowen's chest. That dude's not on his, didn't need It. He build like a CP Ka. Kane had them Jeans a very thick cpa. A he had them Gene, he had them fucking Mayan Warrior doesn't Have Incline machine like Brian Cowen. Yeah. He had some Aztec Warrior genes. Like whatever. Kane had like, like superior genetics that cardios his Cardios giant Nuts. He had The way DC talks about 'em and they're sparring and stuff. So. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I don't think he's just throwing the prison out DC two time. No, DC Clear would clearly say the only reason why I'm heavyweight champion is, is K's not fighting. Dude, I'll never forget when, when Kane was fighting, I was on the same card. I fought Gonzaga. Yeah, he, that was the fight. He fought Lesner and when we're doing, we we're doing the fucking pre shoot stuff. He took his shirt off and I'm like waiting to go.


And he has that brown pride. Yeah. And I looked at the guy doing the video stuff. I go, Hey, if I put White Pride, is that cool? And he goes, dude, just shut the fuck up. That wouldn't go over too big. You're allowed to have Brown Pride. How is It different? You're allowed have Brown. How is it different? Well, because the Mexicans didn't really subjugate the white people in recent memory. It's a little different. It's a little different. Lemme lemme pull out my history book. Lemme bought some history. It's a big difference. 18. And what, What's what this world Stop has, Did you guys see Kat Williams in Phoenix? No. Up. Did you see That? That dude, oh my god. Not only did he lit up that dude, he had the whole crowd chant in America. Yeah, dude. He was like, mother motherfucker, this ain't Mexico. This is Phoenix.


It was incredible. The heckler. Yeah, the heckler. Oh yeah. The heckler in Phoenix. And something About Mexicans and Kat Just bro, the last to, I saw Kat Williams at the comedy store one time. He was so fucking good. He was so, like, I've been doing this for 30 years. He was like, and he was, he was playing with the band and stuff like that. He's, he's one of the great, did you See Montes podcast? No, because he's kind of does a character, You know, and he, he, you Know, he's doing his thing. But Theo's so fucking funny. He breaks like three times. He just Can't. He just can't. Oh really? Because Theo's talking about black ducks. He goes, you need to get you some black ducks. Dude, it's Theo so funny was my, and he's the best. He broke cat like four times. The Really? Yeah. It's the best. How about when he was talking to the president and he was saying, man, that cocaine will turn you into a damn owl.


Have you seen Nothing? Reports turned a damn owl. I, I saw that. And Trump's All, Trump's like, what the fuck the president in the United States. This, he talking about cocaine. But that is like really probably what Trump needed. He needed those kinda interviews. Which, Which comedians was he shitting on when he said, your friends aren't funny? I don't know. Not to make it awkward. Listen, He said that. Why would he do that? He said that because he thought for some crazy reason that I didn't want to have him on, like, somehow or another that I, he would be showing up people or something like, 'cause he's so good. Maybe he thought that because he is isolated. Yeah. That's not even, he doesn't know me that well. The first time I met him was in the studio. Yeah. I love Kat Williams. I've always been a fan. I've always talked about Pimp Chronicles. It's fucking, that's the fantastic.


It's so good. He's so wild. And I've actually taken advice from him. There's two pieces of advice that I took from an interview that he did once that I used to this day one. He said, I never eat before a show. Hmm. He said don't eat. He goes, I wanna be hungry. I better off being hungry. My brain works better. And then two, he said, I have a, a music playlist that I make that just gets me in the mood to do a show. And so I'm like, that's a good idea. And from then on I started carrying around like a, a Bluetooth machine. Like a Bluetooth boombox. Yeah. And bringing show the green room playlist that we have on Spotify. That's All the songs. But it's not hours. It's smart. You guys should do it. That's what Athletes do. It was a smart thing. I was think, I was like, why don't I do that? Like, that makes sense. Like, you want to turn it into a little bit of a party. Yes.


You get that music going. It feels good. Like we do with the Green room at the mothership. You know, get that music going. Everybody's having fun. I wanna Give you a, a compliment Longo who doesn't give compliments. I don't know where the fuck he saw you, but he's said I was fucking dying the whole time. The whole time dying. That was a good show. You killed him. Yeah. Yeah. You fucked up. You I love Hey, this guy. There's a stress Factory in Jersey. Jake Matthews. I'm very high on this kid. I like him too. Very, very high on this kid. Oh, we saw? Yeah. Is this mean Co I think Jimmy k CRTs fight got canceled. Is that correct? Yes. Jake Matthews is always exciting. Christ Always. He's super good dude. He's like one of those guys that look like he could break through any moment now. But he Is a little reckless. So he'll get a win like three and then lose one and then they put Him back down.


Well, he's fighting really good guys, Man. For U ffc. I smell him by submission. That's where I smell. Do you smell? I know. Not Listen, this guy Prada, he's real good, but he's got good striking. Yeah. Jake Matthews very well rounded. Yeah. Very well rounded, but sharp striking. Jake's striking is just crisp out, I think really Intelligent. To be intelligent in this fight. I think he should get his ass down. Is she about to sing National anthem? Heidi Andall on the spotlight. She's been with the UFC for a long time. Jimmy Reet there. I don't, is he about to? I don't even think I met her. There's Jimmy k crude. He's getting ready. Go that. Oh, he's back. Wait, what has happened? Wait a minute. Says brute is back far. So is the fight not canceled?


I don't, I was looking to see if it was that, That was 11 minutes Ago. 1 35 February 6th. A couple days ago. No, but up top it says the brute iss back. That's 11 minutes ago. So he, okay, so he's not off the card. Just Google. Jimmy k crude off UFC card. I I read that. Three different fights were off the card. I don't know man. And Cru was one of 'em. I like That fucking mullet though. Oh, okay. He's in there. Okay. I Like that. Mul. It's A healthy mullet. I like that dude. That mullet. He's, he's very good. What's he fighting? Very good ground game. He's got a fucking Kimora. I don't see That. What weight's he fighting at isn't crew to middleweight. He looks, eh, what what is your He's 180 5 I believe. Yeah, I think he's a middleweight. Thanks. Light heavyweight.


Oh, he's fighting light heavyweight. This fight my Did he to fight? Was he fight 180 5? I think he did. I do believe he did. Is this a last minute replacement fight? Jamie? Which one? This Jimmy crude bto. Or is that the original? No, that's the guy he had. Right. It's interesting that he decided to do that. And he's an underdog. And I don't know. I'm not familiar with Bol. Here's the thing, people hate on the card 'cause they're not big names, but if you notice the way the fight the card's structured, which is why I don't hate on it, is they're all gonna be, for the most part finishes. They're supposed to be on paper. Both Of these guys, you know. But they're super exciting fights. Prado and Jake Matthews is a very good fight to kick it off with. I'm, I'm real excited about this. They're both very good. It's a fun card. Yeah. It's just not one of them cards that like jumps out.


We're so spoil. If you're spoil you're like, where's con? Here's the thing, we're fucking so spoiled because in most sports, like in most combat sports, it's all about the main event. Yeah. Yeah. And they those and they either go away or they, you don't give 'em up. Most People are barely watching the prelims and Boxing. Also, UC has to fill a lot of cards, you know, dude. So you can't have 'em stacked like it's 1998. I get upset on a Saturday when there's no U ffc. I do too. I's Dunno to do. You don't know what to do. Yeah. I fucking, it just, it just makes my day complete. There is nothing better for better than nothing better for me than just chilling at home, watching the fights. I feel so relaxed. I don't have to work and I can watch 'em. Best thing on earth. Oh Yeah. You watch the screen. I I was You don't watch the actual Fight.


Oh, I watch the fight when I can. Yeah. But the problem is, there's some positions where, especially when they're on the ground, like, I don't know if someone's trapped. I don't know if how they have as And You can see it better. Yeah. All I see is a back and a dude. And I'm confused as to what's going on. You know, can't see. I need to see the monitor. Sometimes there's pillars in the way. I need to see the monitor with replays All the time. We don't know if a guy got hit or if it's a headbutt. Like sometimes I remember Matt, Sarah, when he fought Matt Hughes, I thought Matts dropped him And I did fucking drop him. Let's talk about that. Let's, the only question can we talk about, I wanted, every time I hear him say it, it's the truck. Oh, it was a head. But my head hit him. The head connected. He was still Standing. Look at your head. Look at that head. It's All its head. A Head could take It's a head, Head could take out a building.


When I, when I head that head hits tower seven, my hand. What'd you say? I didn't hear. I said that Head hit tower seven. This, this thing could go through a fucking wall and sh it out. It collapsed. When my head touched his chin, my hand went Yes. B And that's what dropped. And it was certainly both, but it was definitely your head hit him first. Yeah, but it, I did not drop Hundred percent crack. Look Matt, you always had crazy power. Nah, that frank trick. Knockout. Yeah. I just happy I got the fucking hit him. You Know that, That's, he went through a lot. He did go through a lot. But how About he's coming back? He looks really good. Who's coming back? Matt, Sarah? No, I I don't mean fighting LI don't mean fighting. I, No, no, no, no. GL just, I mean, coming back from his injury. Come on man. Jesus. GL We can stop if you want.

What Are you talking, what the fuck are you introduced To the conversation? Jesus Christ man can ask questions. I dunno. Christ, it's A trade track. Like it's loo two dial. Maybe he had somehow he information on NASA parked.


He's on cyber truck. Yeah. They knew something. But anyway, point is like, he looks great. Like he, it's been a long road for that guy to recover from that legend. He seems a lot better now. He walks a lot better. He is talking a lot smoother. Thank God I seen him in Manchester. We did like the signing over there like a year ago. How was he? How was he then? Yeah, He's all right.

He, this video of him do has No, no, no. He definitely has. That's like saying I played laser Tag. He definitely bow hunts. Pig. I love pigs A pig. Me Too.


He lives, he lives on an island. He has an island in Kauai that's sure. Infested with wild pigs. He, no, he does hunt them. I've seen videos of him doing it. I've seen him. It's just Zuckerberg. Someone gives him a bow. He doesn't look at it. He doesn't care. Somebody teaches him how to shoot. He's, he doesn't know what release he has. If I said, what do you have? You have a stand. Doesn't you have a wise guy's too rich that shit. What do you have? Do you have He's too rich for that. Why would he, do you use a hinge? Do you have a knock to it? My Favorite part, you can tell. Like if you're gonna talk bows with Joe or or pool or even cars, you better come, correct. Yeah. But this, see I just know what he goes. Yeah. I bow hunt and I thought, oh buddy. But this is Zuckerberg 2.0 and I love it. Talking About Bro Zuckerberg, He looks awesome. He's doing testosterone. He is doing jiujitsu. He's awesome. I don't know if he's doing tests. I hope he's doing tests.


I think he is. But he, he certainly looks a lot thicker. He looks great. When he came in, I was laughing at him. I'm like, your neck looks bigger. Yeah, look at your neck. Yes. He, he turned into a conservative. Yes. Just What? Well, it's convenient. Yeah. Well Also hard work makes you think that way. Fuck yeah. Hard work physically. Physically makes you like appreciate some masculine aspects of life. Do I need a light? I'll tell you right Now, if he, if he fought Elon Musk and Elon Musk is sleeping on the juujitsu. I know he is. Because sometimes when you hear Elon Musk talking about the fighting, you're like, oh shit. Stick to the fucking rockets buddy. I don't wanna see either of 'em. Fall when you're, that you, this fight is heating up kids. These guys are Going, Elon has some white Hits though. He, He could back on's a big fell.


Oh geez. He looks like warm cheese. You see him with his shirt off? God bless. I love Him. But he's a lot thinner now. He got on that ozempic sun. Oh, okay. Because Dude, everybody's, Hey, what is with that shit? He's got skin. Skin is so white. I've seen, I've seen darker clouds. But what? Well, it's a little bit of a cheat coat because what it does is it makes you not hungry and so people don't eat as much and you go into calorie deficit. But you could do that on your own. They use it for addiction now. And it's called discipline. It's a cheap, it's hard for people. But the best way to do it, if you wanna do it on your own, just only eat meat. I swear to God. You'll lose a shit ton of weights. Won't Feel good. Get ulcerative colitis. It does wonders for my I Did you have that? Yeah, I, it They, That's why I did tonight. They're using ozempic for, for Addiction and his stomach.


So Nice. Yeah, the Ozempic Hass got a bunch of other uses too. And it's also like for diabetes, doesn't it stop addiction overall though? I heard people have like Yeah, because it blocks craving pathway. Yeah. Yeah. But what is it? Genius. It ruins Your bones. It's gotta be, is there any tests on it? Like in the long run? Well, The problem is anytime you go into calorie deficit, your body starts eating itself. So what people are losing is not just fat, they're losing muscle and bone density. So Peter Tia, who's a good friend of mine, did some studies on his patients that did it. And he found that even when they lost weight, they got fatter. So they actually gained more fat and they lost muscle. Ain't that a bitch? And bone mass. Ah, yeah. You don't want that. You don't wanna Be weaker. But this is what I think, I think we're those people lifting weights while they were on that stuff?


Here's the thing, I feel like you gotta do something to mitigate the fact that you're, and also just, you can't, you gotta be rational. You can't like, just try to starve yourself into thinness because you're gonna fuck your organs up. It's not good. You, what you really should do is make sure you consume enough calories to support any kind of physical exercise you're doing. And then make sure you do physical exercise while you're also taking that stuff. And maybe then you can keep some muscle and bone. That takes discipline. They wanna just take the shot, get skinny and lean. People do get skinny though. It works. It Works. And it, it sucks being a fat guy. Right. But how fat were you Matt? How about this? Like right now I buck 85. Okay.


What? See my you. Oh, okay. You good bro? Lemme see. See? Oh, nice to see that. Listen to me. No, but lemme get my hand down my, when I was a fatty, I was up to two 30 and I'm five six. God damn. That stink. When you listen. If you, if you got fat, you'd be like, oh, Brenda's a little husky. I've been fat. When you're my height. I'm pointing to Joe too. He's taller than me though. 2, 2 30 Is A lot. Dude. I was heavy. I was heavy. That must have Hurt your joints. Did that hurt your joints? I Not so much. My joints is just, I felt like a fucking fat guy. What you eat the eye dude? I like eat Your lower back. Didn't fuck with you or nothing. Well, my lower back went out at one point and I'm sure that didn't help it. You know? Yeah. But I was, and then I got on TRT, but I was still heavy 'cause I'd be eating like a fucking pig.


But this goes back to the trick thing. 'cause I didn't wanna sound like a bully. The only reason I fuck with that guy still is. 'cause after I knocked him out years later, then I got fat. He called me up one time looking for Ally, a Quinta's number. So I go, sure. I gave it to him. He had al on the show when Al was getting off. He goes, Hey, tell the beer keg. I said hello? So I don't forget shit like that bitch. I don't forget it. I like that though. Now that he's a fat guy and I'm in shape, I'd like to take a shot at him coming. That's fair. Oh, Matthew, you Don't forget a good right hand. I hope he goes for a fucking takedown, man. You Really like, You just do that much, Matt. I've Seen, I I know he has it. So like why this guy? I, why not use it? I think, I think he's doing really well on the feet.


That's why he is, he wants to get a Koko. But Ally Quinte, people forget was that Khabib couldn't Take him down. Al Al was short With Khabib even. But still a short notice for Al. I know it's a different fight for Khabib. But he struggled in that fight. Al had his moments. Al Al did a good job defend, take down. He was Also set to fight Paul Felder. So he was spout to fight a totally different fight. Totally different fight. 24 hours. Notice he did the, he had the best fight with Habib that anybody ever had. That's amazing. Felder, Felder was, Didn't get dominated. Felder was, he lost the fight, but he didn't get dominated like a lot like Connor did or a lot of other guys did. We got smashed. Connor Had some success too in that though too. He did. Yeah. If you watch it again, like it was one round his ass whoop. Yeah. You're like, damn. He Did better against Kabi, but almost than anybody else for a while, Connor.


Yeah. Yeah. I mean, and and his camp was atrocious that time. Was it bad camp? Yeah. Why Really bad. His, his trainer talks about just, it was like a dark camp. He wasn't training with the team. He was like in his head about, he was like, it was a dark camp. It was horrible. This is post Floyd. Yes. Yeah. That's a problem too, right? You get ready for a boxing match with one of the all time greats. You gotta take six months where you're not doing any takedowns bad. No leg kicks, no nothing. All you're doing is boxing. Bad idea. You're not gonna take any extra energy and train your fucking jiujitsu when you're training for a Floyd Mayweather boxer. And he got Khabib the greatest grapple we've seen out there waiting for you ever. It's a terrible Idea. Smack when he is on top of him going, let's talk Now. Now the other side. Let's talk. He made a ton of money. Well, Did you hear it? You were right. Well, you, you were there for that fight.


Yeah. Who, yeah, who was it that said, someone said recently that I think if the Conor McGregor who beat Eddie Alvarez face Khabib would've been a completely different fight. I think so. I probably said that. I don't remember who it was, but I, I, I, I listened to that and I said, you know what? I think that's true. How do you solve that Russell? I think he was a different guy. Different guy. But I think he was a different guy. He was a fucking animal. Space management. I think it was That said that. Yeah. But you're wrestling around. That's Coach Ka. He's coach's wrestling doesn't care about that. I mean, once he closed distance, it'd be a problem for Connor. Oh, it's always gonna be a problem. But Connor was so fucking good on his feet back then. So good. Yeah. So elusive too. I like The clips of him getting interviewed back in the day saying, partying is weakness for your soul.


I know. And then his clips now of him being like, nah, he's fucking all pumped. Oh, the ship has sail. It's like, we want him to come back and ain't happen. Well, He knows too, Jimmy. Of course he knows. Oh my god. Jake Matthews is Walking this street down Jake gun out there. He know he's put on this. If you're the first find in the main card, you're there to finish. Well also he's trying to make a name for himself. And he's in Australia, you know, home country. The whole deal. Prada's in this. That's where he's from, right? Yes. And he from, I think He is, he's Australian. Yeah. You have to have your hometown boys when you have a, a fight on a, a card in the motherland. That's why poor Strickland going back there. Yeah. But trick is from South Africa. It's, it's kind of neutral ground. St. Mary, Mary St.


It's St. Mary. It's Continent. But you know what, it's totally Close. Closer than fucking Vegas where Strickland is. Yeah. Not much. I just rewatched that one. That's Gotta be a bitch. So much. Do you ever, ever fight? Do you ever fight and have to get ready for How'd you score it? It was so close. I Gave it Strickland. I What's that? You gave it to Strickland? Yeah, It was. I mean, how much do you the take takedowns? What do you, how much do you give for the takedowns? He didn't do nothing. I don't think he got struck at All the floor. That's no. So it's like, how do you score those? I thought Strickland won. I thought he won three to two. But same. It was very, I mean it's all how you, the other, I'll tell you though, Drake is does, he mixes in those takedowns and I think that could sway some judges.


Hundred percent. They see big moments instead of the whole round. He's a Big dude too. He, he also pushes, pushes forward. So yeah, he's got, you remember Strickland's the one who pushed forward always. He's got and, and but Octa gun control. When you, when you, when you go through the judges last. No, I understand. But, but the thing I drink is he's gonna be moving forward always. And, and I think Shawn is used to moving forward himself. So he's gonna be fighting on his back foot. But Then also Strickland's not getting points. 'cause his defense is so good. He's, he's blocking a lot of shots. But it looks like they're landing. But he's actually Blocking. Yeah, he rolls Good with that Philly shell. But how much did that cut? How much did that affect him if that happened early on? He talked. He said he was a one-eyed guy early on. Yeah. He talked about, plus The judges see that that's damaged.


That's an among judging Criteria. What, what, what did, what caused that? That cut a Headbutt. They said, right. I not, was It a headbutt or I'm a punch. Yes. I'm not, I thought it was a headbutt. It was a great fight though. It was still a very good fight. People That say it's born, I'm like, man, I thought it was, it was great. It was a high level, very high level for I'd imagine du plus you think you're hard to get ready. 'cause you can't find anybody who spars like that Can't mimic them. Right. Right. It's like he almost fights like a drunk guy in a bar. Oh, like pros Oscar, good luck getting ready for that. Fuck. That Was awesome. His last fight with, Oh my God. He puts him, he like trusts his like spider sense. He goes right in front and he's like, and he crazy goes, it's crazy Man. And his head movement has gotten so much better in those counters, those pull counters.


God, he hit him with a couple of pull left hands and then a right hook counter after that. Oh my goodness. It was blah blah. It was like, duck the punch, blah blah. What, What do you do with Yi though? You know, coming Up, what do, well it's like one more and then maybe tries Alex again. I got one for you. What about Robert Whitaker at 2 0 5. Gary, Robert Whitaker. Gary. Is that Robert? What Robert wants to do, he wants go to 2 0 5. Really? Yeah. That's crazy. For a guy to start at one seven At one 70. That's tough. You've seen it's tougher and make 85. Well, He's bigger now. Robert Whitaker's fucking thick. Imagine. I mean, we've seen it before. Little about Rumble. Rumble starts, his one 70 moves up to Heavyweight. He, I was doing, I was doing Warrior with him.


He was two 30 on set, two 30. And not fat. He sucked down at one 70 Was two 30. He was so big. I, I ran, I ran into him in a hotel once. I'm like, how the fuck are you ever one? 70, 70? His head is big. He was so big. His, his shoulders were as wide as a barn. And he sucked down at one 70. He and he, and he didn't have an ounce of fat on him. Told he was 2 35. He's walking around at 2 35. Can't be healthy. No. That should be Illegal. But when he would get in there, oh my God. He would hit guys. It would just go flying. What did he die of? I don't know. Some sort of organ failure Cancer. He has an organ failure, Some organ thing. Tragic. What is that alp? What is that? That's one of them. This is Tucker Carlson's nicotine powder. Oh, He iss got his own thing. Yeah, that's what a, they're good. Good. They're really good. Are they?


Yeah. They're very good tropical food. Well, the, the people from Zen didn't like him apparently. Oh, is that what happened? He said he, he said something joking around that'll make your dick grow. Just playing around. And they, and they said something about, you know, I don't fuck with Zen either. We Don't think that and don't, don't, we don't agree with what he said. It's not true. Like a duh Duh. Nobody really thinks it makes your Dick grow. I didn't fuck with him before. I definitely don't know. Scott, why Don't you, it's a corpor, don't you? Fuck. Corporations are owned by ceo. Don't like the nicotine. They're run by people. Love People black buffalo Who don't want to be involved with anything controversial. And they probably thought that that being involved with Tucker Carlson was controversial. Yeah, that Was smart. So he started his own thing. So he started his own thing. It's really good. They're gangster. They're better. That's, you've seen Tucker drives like an old school F 100.


Like just Yeah, because he doesn't want the government to have access to his GPS it No electronics. He's got a carburetor. Love It. I was like a, well, If you're that guy, you're doing two hour episodes about a guy who supposedly sucked Obama's dick. Dude, That was wild. I had to listen bro. I had to give it a go. You gotta be, you know, watching your six Fucking Obama, bro. You're fucking, what Did you do Dude? That was a fight, man. That Was a very good fight. Jesus.

There's a Trip. Boom. There's the take down.


Tucker's Way bigger now that he is on his own. Yeah. Oh yeah. Way Bigger. Way Bigger. He's so good. He's undeniable. He is. He's A super nice guy. Yeah. Yeah. Like I had a friend of mine had him on his podcast and he's, he has this lady who works with him that's like real liberal and he said she didn't wanna like him, but she loved him by the end of the show. He's like, he seems like A nice guy. He knows he's a great guy. Exactly. He knows exactly why he stands where he stands. Like he's really thought out every position. It Feels like. Well he is not a liar. He was a little Weird when he was on Fox. 'cause you know, he's pushing the agenda. But then when he went on his own, I'm like, yeah, fuck. Well, towards the end of Fox, he was fighting people who were towards the end of Fox. Towards the end of his run. He was like the only guy on the news talking about real shit. Yeah. And what he left and talking about things that were very controversial and people did not want him talking about That's They fired him.


Right. They fired him when he, He was at the top. That's what's crazy. He was the number one guy on Fox. That was the dominion shit though By, it was a lot of different things. Yeah, there was multiple different, I mean it was, no one was happy. They Both the Fox and CNN ratings suck. Cock find kid gets more views Watching that shit. Yeah. It's, at this point, it's a weird medium because there's too many commercials. You have to watch it at the time that it's on because that's How they make money through All the advertising only. And it's all pharmaceutical Companies it's just too hard to compete with the internet when you have that hindering format. But also The news on internet comes out way faster. Oh, yeah. Than on fucking mainstream News. Yeah. News totally different. But I mean, they're, they're good for like, people that have, You know, editorial talk and breaking things down in a funny way and showing you clips of people going nutty and Yeah.


You know, it's, they're good for, for certain things that's different than the internet. And then they put clips of those things, those things, You know, it's kind of like, it's become almost like a viral internet show. Yeah. 'cause each one of 'em, like the 15 minute ones, when they put 'em out, you know, those get a lot of views, probably more than they even get on television. It's Like, touch point. Oh, Now it's weird because it's like, regular television is bullshit. Nobody wants to watch it. Nobody wants to watch regular Tv. Justin don't trust it anymore. Don't trust it. You just don't trust any of it. They even have sitcoms anymore, like new ones and shit. You know, honestly, miss Pat is a really good one, but it's on Bet's app. She's great. She's great.

It was like positions and counters and moves. It's like always like, you have to be fucking psychotic and obsessed. That's chess loved. It's just, just how long can you do it for?

No, it wasn't, it just wasn't good enough to, to hang with the best guys. 'cause like on the feet, he'd be at such a disadvantage, a liability. And it's so hard to get guys down. It's hard.

He's Got a God pummeled. Yeah, he's getting pummeled, rape, Choke. Let's go. Do they still call it the rape choke? Is that found? They got mad at me for calling that. I told me not call it that anymore. What do you call it? It's the Vander silver rape joke. I know. That's what we used to call it. We used to call. The problem is that we in in training, we would call it the rape truck. And then I said it in in competition. I'm laughing. I We lost this fight was canceled some, a weight management issue issue. That guy's fired. That was the only one. Oh that the one we lost today. That today's Oh yeah. Yeah. If he can go to three quarters here too. So for If I call the rape truck, what should we refer to as I Did They tell you to call it Joe? They didn't have gimme a name. I said it doesn't really have another name. And then someone said, you call it the eagle claw.

He's beating the shit. It's smart. And diving for the back and, and then up on bottom, you know He's also taking advantage of the dude exploded. And then he pumble him with a couple of elbows when he knows he's trying to relax a little bit. His kids could be exhausted. A hundred percent. He's already exhausted and concussed. He had explode to try to get to that position. He's not, he's not getting outta Here. Didn't work. And now he's de demoralized a little bit. He's too flat. He's gonna threaten the Kimora again. Let's go. Yeah. It's not much time to work. But he's got such dominant position. I'd like to see him Soften him up some more.


Yeah. Try to more Damage. Try to fucking move to him. He's trying to get the mount. He Can push that leg down. No, he's looking. Or he could threaten, sit back to more from there. Or He could take the back. There's a nice kimora guard pass from there. Kimora half guard pass there. Yeah, uhoh. Oh he just full Control. That's, he's Good. He has full control. Yeah, he's, he's fully confident This round's ending on top. The way He rode him right there, that's like I could just do this all night long. That was like no worry about losing position. He just gotta get outta that apple. I assume. A guy on the bottom, those are his coaches. They're going get up. But he's doing such a good job. Controlling, I would say get outta that half Car. He knows his escape routes. Yeah. Yeah. He doesn't have many options. But he's using the half car to control a little bit.


Oh he gets back up. There we go. Nice. Boom, boom, boom. Oh right. Fuck yeah. Rugged. Oh, landed, landed one too. He's exhausted. Dude. I like This 20 Go. Oh no. Oh. Oh. He dropped him. The Fuck.

The Worst First round. We need a second Elbows. No, we need a second row. Don't do it. Don't shit. Oh he's getting, you're Okay. You're okay. You're okay. This be a 10, eight round? Yeah. Oh yeah. Ten eight round. Eight round. Where Come from? That's ten eight. 10. Eight round. And they don't throw out 10 eights Too often. They need to throw those bitches out more often. Man. They're so st throw those.


He need 10 eights. I mean, how much time did he have on top? How much time he kept flowing? Beat 'em up. His Mouth is closed. He's breathing. He's fine. He got, Luke was Brian's rooting for? I'm not saying, I'm just saying Weird. His coaches are going weird. Don't do that again. Yeah, right. Whatever that match. Don't do that. Here's my, I don't think he landed on anything. No, no.

Oh my goodness. That's a lot. That sucks. If That's not a 10, eight round bro.


Yeah, it's 10 Round. But they need to do that more often. It's too many close rounds that they give ten nine. Oh shit. And then they give a right round like this at ten nine. That's not right there. Damn. I, I've been saying this forever. We need to get off that fucking stupid boxing system. Yeah. MMA has too many factors to just have a 10 point system. It doesn't make any sense. Why are they not changing that? I don't know. They should change It. 'cause they don't know how to kind of come up with an agreed upon Said, well Doc, doc Hamilton came up with a a another system back in the day. He called it a half point system. And he explained it to me and it made more sense. Like there was, instead of like full points for certain things give half points for certain things. You know, Remember the masses though are familiar with the scoring structure. So then you confuse them more that that's P l's problem.


The smart cage suck my dick. Yeah. Well here's another problem. Only three judges. Why? And tell me why are judges expensive? Get five judges or six judges. Yeah. Have a bunch of judges because But they also shouldn't be rings cage side. Right? Sure they should. It's Too hard to see. As long as they have monitors. They have monitors now. Yeah. But they can give you swayed by the crowd. Like they should be in disclosed area. No, there should be five them. They should be, you wanna hear the, they should be in Ukraine. You want hear the thug? They should be in Ukraine. They want, you want hear the Thuds Ukraine. You want to be there While you, you should be in a drone. You Want to like hear guys yelling at each other. You wanna be like right there. Get an aerial point. I recruits got nice shots man. Because For you to say that like well I should probably be doing commentary somewhere else too.


But No, you wanna be Like right there. No. 'cause you're not dictating the fight. That's true. But if I, I'm not And you have a Monitor, you Fight if I'm not looking at it. Correct. But some of those guys do. No they don't. As body shot. I would rather have you judge the Fight. Well, I mean it be way better. I mean Leban is obviously gonna do a great job. Yeah. Ricardo Alda is gonna do a great job. There's a bunch of people. Look, the LA card had great scoring. The LA card didn't have any egregious decisions. There was not one where everybody was like, what the fuck is that? Right? That's pretty rare. That's Rare. Because a lot of times when, when it's so atrocious. Dude, you're talking about that dude gets half his fucking pay you idiots. I Know. Yeah. It's insane. It is insane. A Tough call's rough anytime you get it. My, my wife just had a, a kickboxing match over the weekend. Oh yeah. Title fight.

It was a split decision. She fought a 26-year-old. My wife's 41. Yeah. Yeah. I'm so Proud. It's amazing too. 'cause she got into everything late. Dude. She never, when I was, when I was fighting, she never threw a punch. What? Wow. Never Threw a punch. Was she an athlete? How High? Nothing in high school. Nothing in high school. Just a little Italian girl. How old are your kids, Matt? My oldest is gonna be 16 next month. So they did And did they go to any of your fights? No. And they've been to all, all They don't. I was gonna say, they, they think the mom's the fighter literally know the dad. No, it's funny. Yeah, no, it's Amazing.


Those Italian ladies have genetic anger. She's, she's got, you know, United States, they got a genetic anger inside of them. Yeah, They're strong. And Ang Your wife's Italian too? No, No, no.

No, she's, she's, she's Irish. Half Sicilian, half Sicilian, half Irish. Oh, she's Half Sicilian wife. Yep. Oh.


Altos wearing a lot of good solid leg kicks. Isn't that crazy Matt? Like your whole career. Did you get calf kicked once? Not Once. It's a new trend. I'm So happy it came after. Did you get Kicked in the, did you get kicked in the thigh though? Not, not a ton. Oh, A lot. Well, I mean, yeah. In training. In training. Fight someone the fights, right? No. Matt, who was that? I, I was good at catching it and coming with a ray, to be honest, I think guys to kick 'cause you can take Them down. Oh yeah. I, I, I was good at catching it right hand down the middle. But isn't it crazy like, there's never been a technique like the calf kick where all of a sudden that came along and everybody had it and changed the course of fights and it's nothing crazy. Nothing crazy, nothing crazy. Just lower. And we still Dunno why. We still don't know why the ties never did it or do it. Why? Well, they, they, they stand with that left leg light.


Oh, is that what it's because they don't have to worry about take down. So they stand straight up. So they stand straight up and you see the ties fight. That left leg is very light, so they check it. It's just not good for getting taken down. It's not a good strategy unless you, you have elite like BJ pen type balance. These Guys are fucking banging, Man. Yeah, he's coming back. He's so fucking tough. He's so fucking rugged. He's actually, but he's also like kind of like catching a lot of the sh shots off his glove. No, he's putting up a good round After getting Dominated. Yeah. And he is actually, a lot of the shots are grazing. He's, he's Got, well he's landing a lot of hard leg kicks, man, over looking. He did it again and again and again. Left's gonna' gonna get chewed the fuck up. What are you saying? Did you say Crude's gonna knock him out? Yeah. I think K Crude's gonna knock him out.


Really? He's landing pretty flush. The kid's not moving. Yeah's gonna, he's also exhaust. Oh, you might be right. He just tagged him with two hard ones, man. Yeah, he's catching him a lot Now. Crew's just the better boxer. This kid's hands are down. Oh, He's getting those low kicks though are brutal. Oh, oh, oh, oh. This kid is Rugged. Jesus. They're both God duh. This is a good guy. He's got enough Snap on it no more though. Fucking Not good for your head. Another low kick. Not good for your head. I'm telling you. He, he lipped a little on that one. Okay. He don't like it? Nope. He's trying to change stances. Yeah. His left leg iss fucked right now. Dude Was earning his fucking, I didn't see That. Oh. Gotta kick mullet back of the head. He kicked the mullet. Oh, he tried to do one himself.


Like Charlie Brown though. Huh? Oh that was terrible. He caught, that's bad. But it's also his left leg is toast. Yeah. Oh. Try spinning on that thing. He didn't know, but he's like, fuck yeah. It's like, oh this thing don't even work anymore. That's A great round. A great way To it round. That's a great round. I don't know who won that round. I think crew, dude. Think recruit got this. Yeah, he won. I think the other guy's gotta go for broke. He has to. Especially that first round. Ten eight. Even if you're won that last round. He's Tired though. It's Yeah, he's head one round for sure. At least one point. Yeah. Even if that guy got ten nine this round. Yeah. So he has to And that's a draw. It could be a draw if he loses the next round. Yeah, I don't think so. I think crude's well had, do you Have to Crude again? I mean, you Just don't know. I think also they're in Australia, they're probably gonna favor cr. Yeah, Well recruit's catching them more.


He definitely hit him with some good shots. Yeah. He hit him with the more meaningful blows for sure. But damn fucking those fucking kicked dude. That's a lot of damage. His soccer kicking his leg. Fuck. How much does that count for? Oh, I don't think as much as head Shots with the judges. The judges Don't because Definitely not as much as head shots. But man, it should mean a lot like when Pereira hits you there, bro. It's just a few of those. And you see guys like, even guys like Jan Bevi who's made outta metal. That guy was limping. Like he didn't like it. He's like 43 now. How old is he? Jan is like in his forties, but still top of the he people keep leaving him outta the discussion. But that guy went to a draw with Uncle Iev. Yeah. And ouch. I mean he, he's the first guy to go to deci.


No. Second guy, Bruno Silva went through decision with Alex too, by the way. That You're Joe, that that that low kick is causing some problems. Oh, he keeps switching up bro. His left leg is fucked up. Makes Sure gun shy as Fuck. He's landed like 30 of them. He keeps kicking him. Ya's Kick his light heavyweights pretty light too. Well, I mean just people are sleeping on him. They're not bringing up Yon Behoves to the discussion of like, who's next? It's Yie. It's these guys. It's that guy. It's like you gotta bring Yon into that discussion. And he just went through major surgery. He had a shoulder surgery. Yeah. Oh Jesus. Yeah. He tore something in his shoulder. I don't know when he's ready to return. I don't even know if he's done rehab. I'm not sure. But I mean, outta respect, I feel like you gotta bring that guy up.


He's an animal. Hey Joe, outta left field. But with the stem cells, you, when you get that shit out here, do you get the IV or you Yes. You can get the out as well. Yeah, Because I plan on going to Columbia with my, well they can do way more down there. Okay. All right then. I'm taking that Trip. They can do a lot, but it might, I don't know what the actual dose you need is. So this is what Brigham's argument is at ways to, well he is like, look, we have an amazing results with what we can use here in America. And I, they definitely use more cells in these other places. And there's certain things they can do like in Mexico, in Panama and Columbia that they just can't do here. I, the question is, is it more effective?


This is the problem with it not being like legalized with the FDA. Oh, okay. Because if it was, and you could do in Mexico what you could do here, then you would be able to say, oh this is too much. This is the right amount. Do more than this. It's just like your body doesn't utilize it. It's like there's a number that you're probably gonna get to. That's the right amount of cells. That's the perfect amount. We don't really know. All we know is it works. We, you know what works though? The settle the sciences. Oh yeah. I had a full length rotator cuff tear and my shoulder, it's gone. Oh wow. See That's what I'm saying, man, I know that shoulder issues and now I'm feeling my right shoulder bad.

He's pretty fucking good at judging fight. He's been around for fucking ever Gabriel last round. Your guy Brian? He did. He has it in 1919. Okay. See the, the thing is, it's like those leg kicks have compromised him so badly.


Yeah. And he keeps landing them. Like crew just can't get off. He can't move. Right. Right now. See, like even I just, the distance scored there. Yeah. But He's forward. He's fallen forward. His left leg is all fucked up. He scored again though. He's, he is, he is making contact with his head. Now He's making contact but he's like, he's limited to like one leg in his arms. Yeah.

I, I would've to go watch the second round and not talk. Yeah. I think, Oh, back kick. Honestly, he caught him with the toes though. He Spent more time on top. And Did he get a ten eight round on that first? Yeah. You are also assuming a ten eight.


Yeah. The kick go. The, when you land a back kick with the toes, it doesn't have much on it because your foot gives great knockdown. So like when you land it with your toes, like that sidekick style your foot gives, oh you really wanna land it with a heel. Oh Damn. Like John Jones did with steep a Ooh gnarly Lord heavyweight to do a spinning Lord Kick and perfect. Like Right. You see his, we, we watched it and slow moed and watch his ribs cave in. Nasty bro. Like halfway into his body cavity. Rough. Why is he sticking his to out his tongue Seconds? Dude, he's doing that for like fucking 10, five seconds. This The last few seconds of the fight can Jab that shit. You lose your Tongue. He's gonna be limping for a, for a good two weeks.

Majority draw. Really? Wow. He should have, that means he didn't get that. I don't Get it. That's the 10, eight round. The first round. Two means the other guy won the next two and that's it. I don't, oh, one judge gave it for crew. Wow. That's surprising. We'd have to watch that second fight or second round rather. Who's close? Nobody got robbed. Like you wouldn't say crew got robbed.


Shit, I have no problem withdrawals. Oh no, we got the heavy. Oh, dudes heavy. That should be a quick Diego Lopez versus Yaya Rodriguez. What they're gonna do, that'll be sick.

I mean, they're just letting him have his victory lap now before they start talking about who's next. Ah, That was, they should, he deserves It. But if you, you would want, I'd like to see San Hagen, but he has to have a win. Right? Like he lost to Omar. Yeah. I wouldn't be mad if they just gave him a shot though. Hey, TGA Lopez dismisses.

I was there, I was seeing Darren, the owner of PFL or GFL texts his, his manager and he goes, he in and he goes, yes. So he didn't have straight dialogue with Rashad, but he assumed the agent representing him. Oh, when he says yes, he's good to go. I see. So he announced and Rashad's like I never said yes.

And it was in a transition though, so he's good. Right. My first instinct was that was an illegal knee, but he kind's a little, I think he knocked Him down first, Joe.


He definitely did. Oh yeah, he definitely did. Elbow to the fucking tfa. Looks mad. He's upset. I think that they stopped it. Or did they? Is it the knee? It's The elbow that put his ass down though. He wasn't defending himself. It was, it was, but that knee. But it was in transition transit. Here We go. Here we go. Here we go. Watch this. If it's in transition, I think you're good.

It was a, it was a PR class. That guy's Not my Captain America. No, that's not my captain. 'cause pussy. Well, that's a giant like Steve Rogers.


Isn't it weird that they feel like they have to say stuff like that to keep working? It's weird. It's So, but the movie studio goes, it's not good for fuck face. It's not good for numbers. Now Americans aren't gonna go to fucking Captain America. It's Terrible for numbers. That's what happened. Yeah. You know, he's out. You know who really fucked up Batista?

He's taking that girl up in the sky to make out with her. Matt looks terrible, bro. Matt, The dog's a bad choice, huh? Admit that. Yeah. Matt kind of took me, the dog took me out. It, you know, I thought the dog would be a bad choice. I thought the dog, but I thought the dog's a bad choice. I don't think James Gun could do any wrong. I agree. He's great. He's the Man. He's great. He's the man. I'll see it for him. All three guardians of the galaxies were fucking Phenomenal.


Phenomenal, phenomenal. He Knows how to make you care about characters that you never heard About. I don't care about that dog. Like a fucking, like a raccoon. That's fake. Superman dog.

It's James Gun. I'm James Gun. Didn't they try canceling James Gun for being mean On set? I think so. Yeah. Did it What? Gr Too talented. No. I think it was some like tweets he did back in the day. Some shit. Some Bullshit. Some bullshit. Whoopsies. But anyway, Yeah, he was saying funny things.


Whoops. We're all looking forward to it. Yeah. Except me. Well, I got mom confused. I stopped rooting for the Hulk when he started wearing glasses. I was like, you're lying to me. This is not hu that sucked. No is Not. You can't have the Hulk. He's Bruce banner's fucking brain. And the Hulk's body is bad eyesight. It's supposed to be. He changes and now he's this fucking ferocious monster. It's true. And he doesn't remember what fucking happened. Wait, now he My glasses. You're saying? Yeah. The new Hulk has glasses and he, he, he lost. He lost weight and he got shorter. Well, listen, he lost the fight to Thanos and he became a pussy. I'll tell you what, the 2008 Hulk was pretty good. What's size I the one with Ed Norton and Hickson Gracie. I like 1977.


Yeah, that was a good one. That Hulk was awesome. Yeah. Hulk the 1977. Eric Was such a pussy. Eric Bono was great. Do you know the real problem? He was all right. I think Ed Norton was the best one. But here's the problem. He is the pants. The pants don't make any goddamn sense. They don't make any, how are they standing up? I wanna see that big green dick just swinging around while he's smashing things. There's no way he's wearing 160 pound dude's pants that don't make no sense. Facts. He weighs 8,000 pounds. He's as big as a fucking building. And somehow another, the pants cover his dick. It'd be great if his dicks stayed the same size. Look at the size of him. Yeah, that's the whole humans. That's what the whole Is supposed to look like. Didn't made him smart. Do you think the Studios tell they like, shut The fuck up, Dude. No, no one's gonna go see it. They don't care. They're all in the bubble. Who's They're Mark Ru Ruff woke guy talking about politics.


I like him as an actor though. He is a good actor. Great actor. He a lot of Fox catcher. Crazy. They're crazy people. Yeah. They're Really good actor. I thought Edward Norton was good. Edward nor was My favorite. Edward. He was my favorite. Hadix in there. Fucking breath. Yes. Smacked him in the face. Yeah. Tried to keep him calm. Remember? That's gotta make Sure Eric Banner was his, his control. Bannon wasn't bad. The B But look, that's smart. Hulk. Hulk is smart now. Now makes You know, he wears t-shirts. Oh, she Hulk. Don't see, that was a pile of shit that she Hulk was a woke pile of shit. All the new one. Was it woke? Oh, it was woke. Didn. There's a guy looking to Thank God. That's over. There's one. Oh. Oh fuck. It was brutal. Thank God. That's over. Is it over? It's over. Yeah. It's definitely over. Thank you bro. It's gonna be illegal soon. Here she Comes. New chair. I'm calling it.


What do you think Trump's gonna make Being woke? Literally illegal champ for a wild soon. Do you hear what he said about Prince Harry? They were asking him he was gonna deport Prince Harry. Prince Harry talks shit about it. He goes, no, he's having enough problems with his wife. She's Terrible. Oh, he's funny. He's so Funny. Animal. They ask him, he's gonna deport Prince Harry. Yeah. Look at this. Say what you will. He's still, he's a funny fucking dude. Man, look at this. Killed Focus in this girl's eyes. She's Such a beast, dude. You just gotta worry about the injuries. You know, if the neck's gonna arise. Right. Where's she at now? Yeah. 'cause she's fallen out. Two fights in the said fuck it. It's go time. Gave her title shot. Yeah. It's so hard to know if she can even get through a camp, right? Yes. It's so hard to know what these people, when they have like real bad injuries and then after the fight they'll tell you like, my camp was a a shambles.


I couldn't do anything. Like What'd I bet on you. I had a Broken foot. Well how about like, Aspenal wins the title. He, he couldn't train. He couldn't wrestle foot at all for like 11. Takes fight 11 days out against serial Gun. That's right. No knee. Blown Out. Fucking Knee. Blown out knee. Takes it up. Yep. Takes it up. And decides to take him to the ground. Yeah. Take Cyr the ground and wrestles him. And just shows. Showed that he's Covington Broke his foot in the first round. That That was in the fight though. Leon, that's different. But Still that's different. He was just a really Bad Break. Yeah, but that's in the fight. Yeah bro. How fucking do he, how good did Joaquin Buckley look against Colby? Fuck. Fuck dude. Joaquin Buckley's a problem. He's Joaquin. That good is Colby. Well he knocked out. Look what he did. The Wonder Boy. Wonder Boy. Yeah, he's that good. He's fucking, He's good. He's fucking dangerous at one 70.


And he's got crazy cardio at one 70. I Still wanna see him and Ian Gary. Oh yeah. Because that was originally supposed to go down. Yeah. And then they swapped it. Ian Gary is fucking amazing. Yeah, that would be A real good fight. Think about Ian. Gary beat MVP. MVP looked great against, you know, MVP. Awesome Bro. MVP is the fucking man that against Shi Bull. That was incredible. That was great. 85. 85. No, he wants to go up to two. Oh. Wants fight y. My thing is do it. Make the fun fights like cowboy serone style. Do the fun fights, but then come back down, do 2 0 5 and then come back down. Yeah. Let you don't fight the big boys fight. You's a thin two. Oh fiver. Yeah. Yeah. But y he is a different thing man. The style matchup though. It's, well, it'd be very exciting. Here's the thing, on the outside, no one can touch MVP.


You can't close the distance like he can. No one. He's got that elite at 37 Elite Point fighting style. I always said that. Like that's gonna be the next problem is point fighters. Because they got that blitz, that ability to cover the distance. It's so fast. They don't have knockout power. Some of them do. Name one that does wonderboy. Wonderboy had a point fighting style. I mean he basically started out in karate, you know, and then developed as a kickboxer above the leg Kicker. But then when he got to the elite level, he was at knocking guys out. Well He couldn't wrestle with them. The problem with like Matt, the Immortal Brown was the first guy to ex expose his ground game. Remember that? He said his nickname? Yeah. He took him down and smashed him. That Was His first fight in the U ffc, wasn't It? I don't know. No, the first fight was the ko. He got that guy with that over the shoulder kick.


Where? Like Maybe a second though. It was early On. Early on. Went down with that round. It was very early on. Very early on. When he knocked out Jake Ellenberger with that wheel kick. Jake Ellenberger was like making fun of spinning shit. Yeah, He said the karate. Yeah. That's Funny. Making fun of spinning things. Remember like, I hope he does. I hope he does try to hit me with a wheel kick. He knocked out with it. Boom. And then remember Wonder Boy beat Robert Whitaker at one 70 and then Robert Whitaker's 85. Robert Whitaker was way too big for one 70. What are we doing? He was dying down there. What? Just dying. Wonder Boy's sidekick is the nicest in the business. Oh, it's so smooths. So, and it's so like it comes off the ground effortlessly and just sticks you, it's lifting like a jab. His right leg forward. When he, he, he throws it that way.


It's fucking so nasty. And it's so hard to deal with. Yeah. Because he can do All the other stuff too. So it's like, and he also, Wonderboy was one of the best ever at leaning his head back like a fucking snake and then firing at you as he's moving backwards. See I Feel like MVP doesn't have that. Like he's not landing those big shots like one boy did. It's hard to Hit on the, well he does on some guys. Yeah. You also gotta realize like not the U ffc. No, not, he hasn't landed anybody. Not K one guys yet. But look, what he did is Cyborg. It's a wake up call for everybody alive. Jesus. If he Cyborg was 77 years Old, he was 107 seven. But he caved his skull. That was bad. That Was bad. The worst knockout ever. I'll tell you what, x-rays gnarly.


Here's another guy everybody sleeps on is like, who did like, so what were his losses? Whose MVP? Doug? Who? He lost? Douglas Lima was the kale. He kicked his leg out. They lost a wrestler. That's right. But Lima was the first guy to stop him. Yes. Because Lima started. Lima had, he's one of the most slept on guys at one 70. He's a guy that I really wish had left Bellator. I know in his prime. He's with GFL. That's good. But how old is he now? Be dead. Do Haven't heard from him for a while? No. When was the last Time contracts getting fights? Contracts are a mess. They just sat guys on the show. 37. 37. My fight. September 7th. There's still Something in the tank there.


Oh, he was a monster in his prime savage. A monster in his prime. Do you remember, do you remember what Ben Asin did to him? Yeah. Ben Asin just said, oh, that's cute. Molly whopped him. I didn't see you're gonna enjoy wrestling now. Who did he fight? Diego Lima. Oh my. Oh yeah. Yeah. Douglas Champion Diego fought ufc. Yeah, right. Douglas Lima was the, it was no disrespect, but was slightly better. Douglas was a Bellator champion. Yeah, he was a beast. Man. Beast. But the problem with that Bellator title was like, nobody cared. I'm glad you're making money. I'm glad you're getting paid. I'm happy for everybody. Nobody. It's like being CFL world champion. Okay. Yeah. But we got the NFL. It's great. I hope you're getting paid. That's the most important thing. Yes. But after that, like if you want to make the splash, you want to be famous, you want to have a legacy, you kind of gotta make it over to the UFC.


If you wanna say you're the best in the world, you have to, if you're the champion anywhere else, if you're not in the U ffc, you're just not the best. Unless you do the Francis thing. You go over there and they give you $20 million a fight. Like, and it's a big fuck you to Dana. 'cause you still get to box. Yeah, you get to box. He's, but he's in a unique position. Like Francis' position is different than everybody's. Yeah. He's heavyweight and the box is the entertainment Heavy monster. Yes. Destroyer. Yeah. Knocks guys out with one shot. Like he's always gonna be thought of as the heavyweight champion until somebody beats him at heavyweight. You know what he did to Steep Bay? And then, you know, he beat Cyril, gone with a blown out knee and then just dipped lips. See you later. See I, I think pound for pounding. We won't ever fight out. I think Tom Aspenal is the best. I think Tom. Well who knows? I think Tom beats him.


Who knows. Knows John beats him. John might beat him up. Yeah, he could. John might take him down and fucking rag do on the ground. Like, you know, John easily could we, because we don't know how good John is either. And we Also don't know what happens to Tom Aspen on the third, fourth, and fifth rounds. Zero idea. 'cause no one's gotten there. No one's even gotten close. There's so many question marks like we don't know how good John is. I Right. You can't tell me John's the best of all time, or he's the best goat. But you can't tell me he's the baddest heavyweight on the planet after being an older, steep a Right. That's not gonna do it for me. Right. But Ason fucking a fucking good. And he prime Man. Well, Cy Gun almost beat Francis. I know. You can say the thing about the knee and Jones just smoked him.


What? Right Through. We also didn't know Fran or fucking Cyro. Gunn was a fucking three stripe white pelt. That's news to me. What is that? So What does that mean? Can he get that third stripe? It's a, he's gotta be able To, I was gonna say like the, the bulldog guillotine, it's like, hey dude. Nah, it, he, Well I think, I think he, I think he might have frozen. It feels like he froze the big lights there. I don't Give fuck Think he probably thinks is not used to a guy that's that good. Getting a hold of his neck. Yeah. I All the, At that level, I think he Just world champion John caught him. Yeah. John caught him. He caught him. I think John does that to him. A hundred out a hundred times. There's nothing, there's not enough hours in the day for cereal to make up for it.


It was great distance management too. John just avoided All the big shots. The timing of the shot was perfect. I can see John taking Aspenal down. He Very well. You're talking about the black belt who grew up in jitsu gym like Matt? Yeah. He took, he took up, he took Jujitsu twice. Sure. Two time Olympian. It's not easy. DC's not a black belt on the fucking ground. I wonder how he gets off his back. I wonder If he has a guard. I know. Does He have a guard? Does He have a guard? I assume It's not a lot of big guys don't have a guard. He's been doing jujitsu in his diapers. Man. You're talking about, there's picture four old. You Old assume that. But man, we've seen a lot of guys who are really good and they're on their back and they got nothing. They have no answers. I agree. But athletic as he is in growing up in that culture, you, the guard's not gonna be shit.


Yeah. It might not be. But you Know, I don't know if he's du You know, more than anybody. That big guys are mostly on top when they're training. Always. Yeah, I know. I know. So that's the problem. Unless you're a guy that's smart about it. Like Fabricio Verdu who develop, I mean, that's a rare guy who's a big guy who developed a killer. He's my, in my top 10 of all time. I always put in Fabricio. You gotta remember that guy tapped everybody. Dude. Top 10. This are you in top three Of all time of all time. People forget him. They, they sleep on him when they talk about great fighters. First one to tap Fedor. First one to tap. Kain Bigfoot Silva. Tap Ka. Come on bro. Yeah. KD Mark Hunt. Yeah. Flying knee. Remember that? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tap Kain. He he tapped everybody. Tap Noguera. Travis beat the brake. Travis brake Off Travis Brown.


Travis in his prime. Yep. Yep. Tapped everybody. Flying. Flying side Sidekick to start it out. Yeah. Savage. Fabricio overdo was a bad man. So good, bad man. Ah, she's gonna get it down.

That's The move I you to sweep the deal with A deep head. Yeah. It's like you're putting your legs in jeopardy when you're trying to mount All the time. Yeah.

But she will it down.


She's step over. She's gotta get it with a control. But, But this is a lot of fucking energy. That's All The other, that's what's, unless you're Miserable. And also Jean is way more like Rab. Yeah. Like that lady can go. She just keeps going. She's a fucking machine. She's being, oh, look at that need of the body. Dude. That's a nasty need of the body. She's a champion and she's free 100% man. Battle tested. She's made a Different shit. Come on. Talk. Not breathing that hard. She looks all right. Look at that sidekick. Oh, look at that. God. Nice right hand. Oh my goodness. Nice.

Can I remind you? That's right. This girl's a warrior. I like that you whispered that brother. No, I'm not. I love Oh, All the Respect wing shots. Jean Lee is just throwing from the out. She clip, not a separate cup coming down. She Set up the take down, Tatiana. I was about to say, God Zombies double Straight zombie. Well, you go to your happy place when you're kind of tired and getting rocked. Well, this is where she wants to be for sure. I against cage beeps though. Sure. But there's not, she's not doing anything. Well, she just can't. I mean, Jean, we Lee's I think surprising her with the take down defense. Yes. And just the Physicality. She she's been working her wrestling. That's what, look At the physicality son. Yes. And she's been doing This so fucking strong and fit. Look at this again. Look at this. Turned it around man at again.


This is huge. So she's got this round. Yeah. She's winning This round. Yeah, for sure. Has. So it's one, one now one, One. It's making it exciting. Yes. It's one, one. And if I was betting on this, I would, it's tough to, To back to China. I better get Yeah, she's Gotta get busy. Another One for China, She would've had That. The fact that Jean able to keep her on her back is very impressive. Yep. Very, very impressive. Especially when Tatiana's so good at those butterflies and elevating people. Their guard's good. But She's been working nothing but wrestling. She knew she was gonna deal with this. We all knew she was gonna deal With this. Right. Yeah. But, but somebody who like this, is that her learning curve? I bet Tatiana did not think she was gonna spend a lot of time on her back. No, I bet she did not anticipate that Jean, we, Lee was gonna be able to do this to her. Especially in the scrambles.


'cause Tatiana has been dominant in the top position, dominant right over everybody to get taken. And then also like a second round grueling pace of a five round fight. And in the second round you're getting mauled. That's not a good feeling. No. She Got that wrestling. Grit. Let's go. You know, it's Go, it doesn't matter. America Doesn't Matter. I'm I'm back on Team America. Yeah, I'm back on switch. Yeah. I wish, I bet money that I'd be hoping I'd lose it. Listen, you, you, you, you chose I did Chang in. Well I chose Champion because it's just like, there's a big difference in stepping up and fighting a champion like this Huge, when you've been dominating ladies that are of a lesser caliber. I mean, John Whale Lee's complete and now you're seeing it. And also fucking tank.


She's a tank of a lady. All right. We got one in one right now. What? It's all about the tide. Boys. Once the tide takes you out to sea, even though if you're only a hundred yards from the shore direct, it's going the wrong Water. I think it's very demoralizing when You realize you're going on the wrong direct. What go-to move is not working Right. You're wrestling is getting, I'm Pete, my friend Matt here, she beat cancer. Right. Listen you a lot of respect. I'm just Saying's got a good record. You're dealing with a different breed, different Human being. Yeah. She beat cancer. You think she's worried about a Chinese girl? Yes I do. Chinese Girl's beating her ass. Oh, right hand at. Look at that. That was a nice right hand. Oh, She's rugged though. But Ah, Look at this.


That's where it went. South Force. Yeah. You see what it so impressive. Just the fact that she's able to do this to Tatiana is so impressive. She's been drilling this. Look At this right here on the kisser, her son. Look that right hand. I watched one countdown video where they had the Iowa, You don't even know the name of the guys. I What I'm saying is that those he Knows the state. No. She was doing a lot of wrestling. And somebody like this, I I I do think it's one thing. You're not gonna beat her in wrestling, but you can neutralize the wrestling. Hey, how about let Mike Beltran, let his fucking mustache free. He's the best. I know. Let that mustache free. He's the best. Let that mustache free. Why? You gotta tuck it in your shirt. That's bullshit. U ffc. Let the mustache free. Look At her. Look at her. Look at this Round. So Important. She's got a crazy gas tank. Dude, this so important. Fresh.

I'm just saying. Jesus. You know why, Why did they n it? I don't know. Oh, look at that. Oh. Oh, They don't like it. They don't like the crazy mustache. For some strange reason. I think it's awesome. It gets in their face. Shut up. When he is in there, he Can't have No, it doesn't. It's hanging down. Might get grabbed. It's like a ponytail. Boy, You know what I just realized? We never had a woman referee. We have Who? There was that one that bring that shit up. Dude. What's her name having?


Yeah. The tall blonde girl. Oh, she's Big. Right? Way Back in the, oh Boy. She's getting clocked. Oh no, she's getting clocked. How Many women's close? I can't remember in recent times. Of female referee. Oh Jesus. Oh shit. Oh My goodness. Oh my goodness. She Just can't, she can't strike with her. No, she Can't. Dude, that was a pretty fucking hard shot right there. Goes to her happy place. Oh, she snapped her down. Goes to her. She pped her Down. Come on man. She, Oh, she's stuffing it now. Yeah, she's stuffing it now. Now she's putting on her. It's One. It's Oh, nice. Need the body. Tiana. Come on man. Vision quest. Let's go Look at that. Oh, she Caught again. Oh, that was a, oh, this is rough. The problem is the striking the difference. Big difference. The big, she's not setting up. She's not Saying striking there.


And it's also the pace, man, Sean, we leaking just maer and these pace. It's Also Tatiana. She's, she's not putting the strike the shoot shots together So that not setting up. S going. Yeah. Kim Winslow. Yeah. She is Fired. Literally ruining people's lives. They said, whoops. They fired her. Oh, sorry Kim. I mean, bring up old wounds. Look At this boy. Tati. I just finish it. Can't get her down anymore. She keeps, She does the same take down over. Impressive. That's so impressive. What John Le Lee has been able to do here. Just to be able to stop these take downs and reverse them. Super impressive when she gets them. So impressive. Yeah, but it's like the physicality of Jean Lee is just something to think.


Look at that one. Two, She's landing through Nasty. Great athlete. Nasty. Yeah. I mean, just incredible conditioning. Yes. I mean, you ever watch her workout videos? They're fucking mad, dude. Yes. Brendan. Her strength and conditioning is mad. Brendan, you wanna come over to my side now look at her. No, he's stand strong. We Don't jump ship. It's like going to electric cars. You'll never do it. Brian, If she wanted to have sex with you, you'd be very uncomfortable that she'd kill You. Yeah. She might be my type. 'cause I'm guys, Guys, Guys. I'm a fan of her too. I would beat the shit out of her. Yeah, but you 280 pounds You just said I'd be scared Of her. Not you, Brian. You. That's why I said that. Brian, Brian had Tiana At all. Right. You know, and she's not able to, to stuff. Those take downs and Tiana's like hesitant to keep going for him.


Now watch, every time she Him up, she Just walked. When she punches her head's just off the center line. Every time she's fucking Zang Has some traps. Huh? She's A tank. We, Tiana got that first take down. Oh. Oh, look at it's, she did her whole choa and nobody ever got away. That's all sort of striking. Is fucking just higher level, Man. Very, very good. Very good. Striking. She keeps catching her. Yes. That Lighter quick. Tatiana just keeps moving forward. No, this doesn't work. Oh, The difference of the striking. Yes. Oh, It's big. Much Higher level. Much higher level. Tatiana keeps moving forward in just one line. And John, we Lee has not shown any signs of deteriorating. No, no. Not at all. Look at that. Just stepping back, moving, waiting.


I don't think that Tatiana, like she's not even throwing that left hand. She's at a loss At all. She can't. She's, because she pays every time. She keeps getting Bad. See that's the problem right there. The entry. And when she does look the entry, she gets spun around. It's so bad. It's crazy. But this is how strong Jean Lee is, man. It's impressive. Look, look at that. Look at this. Fucking impressive. Is that me coming? Oh. Oh, look at that elbow. Oh, another elbow. Oh my goodness. Look at that. Oh my goodness. Champion. You're Talking about A Champion. Yep. Damnit. Dominant woman man. Yes, dominant. Just a great fighter. Forget it. That kick's not it. So good. So Good. And again, it's like you got got Rose, you got her, you got Ana. You got like the elite of the elite in this division and she's fought 'em All.


Her balance is perfect. Look at Tatiana. Her head's All the way over. She's just leaning a lot of weight on her front foot. Forget It. What do you mean? Whoa. That's what I talking about baby. That's a good shot. Finish that shit. Come On. That's a great job. Ducking. That's a good shot. And she doesn't get it. Amazing. Damn man. I that Me Too. Two, One. That was something Down. And then boom. Boom. Oh my goodness. She goes low and high. How about those elbows in tight when they were up against the cage. Those were fucking nasty. So much higher Strike. How is she now? Elbows. Yeah. She's, Ana's never been deep facing adversity deep. So now she's in the fourth and fifth. This is the big rounds. We're in the, we call this the deep waters.


The Deep, I think that Tatiana doesn't have a game plan right now. It's just she Suspend Well, her game plan was a moler on the ground, and then that's not working. Look at the, now you're forced to strike in the outside. You're fucked. Look at her breathing, man. Look at her breathing and the body Language. She doesn't really know what to do. So she's moving forward and kind. She's, well, there's body language. The tools fix the problem. That body language is not good. Her Head's literally past her front foot. Yeah. Then You got this Chinese terror waiting over there. It's a disaster. This body language right here, That's never a good sign when she's already off the stool and jumping around like that. It's A nightmare. This is bad body language. Yeah. That's, that's rough, man. This is where it gets hard. 'cause you've never done this. Fourth and fifth. Listen, guys Worked on the wrestling. Like John, We worked on the wrestling. How many times am I gotta take you? Yeah, But it's also the striking the championships experience.


It's all of it. Well, they're asking to Tatiana do a lot. And she, she jumped the cue. Oh, listen, her age to, he was all American. I just a while ago. Isn't that amazing? Isn't it incredible? I'm just explaining Fairweather Frank. Thank you. Thank you. Unbelievable. No, she can still do it. Unbelievable. Oh, she Could still do it in the fourth round. I'm still with you, Right? Unreal. I'm staying with Tatiana. All right, Let's go. I, I like your, I like your, I like your loyalty. I do. I appreciate it. Let's see what happens in the fifth round. It's gonna be going, I've been thinking Tatiana All the time. I just want her to win because I'm American. Look at her. I think she's going in fearless now. 'cause she knows She's Oh, that's exciting. Oh. Oh, right. Yeah. Oh, Jesus. Oh, she clipped her again. Now she's stepping back.


Oh, again. Oh, Christ. Like when Tatiana closes the distance. Oh, wow. She, she took her down. Unbelievable Unbeliev. Unbelievable. Yeah. What Happened? Hot on Saturday? What? Wrestling? What Wrestling? America. Yo. Oh man. Someone said three. Oh, Zane. Get the fuck outta dude. I want to, No, not three. Oh, I get the first round. Well, the first round she did Communist. Get on top at The end, Bubba. I'm just sorry. I told you. Can I just tell you with this half guard escape, it's killing me. I wanna fucking show it to you right now. What is It? I, I I Hers You mean If she uses her left leg, pulls it out, pelvis up and down. She's out. What do you mean? Like With her left leg, if she pulls, scrapes it out. Okay. And she brings her pelvis phone into the floor. She's out. Right. I'll show, I'll put Brendan on me afterwards.


I'll show you. Okay. Really? Yeah. Out it not, because once you get to your side, you're out with it. Her, her left. She, I, I, I, I, I used to use that when I was two 30, getting out from underneath. I swear to God, Matt, if I live near you, I would be taking classes From, if she had the underhook on the left side. Right. If she has her underhook and she brings her forward, gets on her side. Yes. Retract this arm. We scrape that out. Pelvis forward into the floor. But, but it comes out like Butter. But wait, but her, you're saying her pelvis on the floor, but then isn't she on the, how does she escape from that? Yeah. You gotta show it to me. I'll Show it to you. Right. You would've to be in the half guard. But when you're in the half guard, she, the, where she has the underhook on the left hand side, she could basically pop her left leg out, put it beside her and, and, and lean her body left.


And she would take her down. She would, well, well look at this head an her arm. Oh. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Oh, that's bad. Oh my goodness. That's bad. Oh my goodness. That's bad. So I'm half guard. She should at this, at this. Oh my God. Thinks She's okay until Wait. Well, Jean might get out. She's gotta get All the way over the side. Might get All the way over. Yeah. Gets over the side. Big, big problem still. She's cooking her, she's cooking her in this position. Yep. And she's waiting like, She's not doing good here, man. No, she's waiting. She is not good. And that left leg is basically free. If gets that left leg is basically free. Right. Look at that. It's basically free. What does she wanna do? Get her hips on the Ground. She wants it to the right side, but she doesn't wanna lose position while she's doing it. Oh no. Tatiana brought her back to full guard. Nicely done. That's over now. Now it's gone. But that was close. But she probably didn't want fucking knee championship experience too.


Didn't want to gas her. Her arms Out. Somebody cut her knee with a knife. Look At that shit. Oh my God. Look at that gash on her left knee. Jesus Christ. How'd That happen? That's a good question. Oh. Oh Jesus. That's bad. God Damn. She's just mauling her, pushing her face down. Just ugh. Oh, y Nasty elbow body, man. Oh, she's so physical. Man. Fuck thing about Jean Wei Lee is like, her training is, it's on the world. It rivals everybody's, yeah. It's like her strength and conditioning training is fucking amazing. Yeah. It's ridiculous. If you wanna get fired up for a workout, watch her strength and conditioning training. She's ferocious, man. And again, it's that championship level experience. Like she's been in all these trench wars.

Look at the, oh, Tatiana scramble. Oh, look at that. She, she capitalized on the scramble. Look at that. Yeah. But Now so much better shape. Yeah. She can get on that half guard. A lot of it is just being in better shape. Man. Her fucking physical conditioning is like, she can push this pace.

All that happened. Was she Jean fucking monster. Monster. What a, what a problem she is for, for Tatiana. It's tough 'cause you're 31 coming off these injuries. You had to shot the title. You're not even close to The, you got mauled and you spent most of the fight on your back. Which tough is crazy. It's tough. I wouldn't be surprised if she retires. Well, who knows? I mean, she might have had a real hard camp with all those injuries. Oh, she's getting beat up. I Just think, I just think striking wise, it's very different. There's Not a s In the days that ground pounds on from the top though. This is top control. Like, forget about the striking, which is amazing. But Jean, we lee's dominating her on the ground. I mean, beating her up. You Know who look good with the, the jasmine? Look at this. Telling Her to stand up Canadian girl. Look at this. Oh, she looked bored. She Looked really Good.

There's not enough hours In the day. There's, there's no game plan. You, you can't catch that. That gap. That's a big gap. And you're 31. So who else for her, who else is in Jean? We lee's division.

Look at this. Oh man. That was a mistake. Yeah. Pulling. She didn't have any Answers. It's just, it's a, It's just so impressive. The take down defense. So impressive. And the, the ability to scramble and always wind up on top, like right here, man. That's so impressive. That's the difference. She's a great athlete. So just a tank man. And also skills. Yeah.

You're basically a black belt. You just gotta keep training. Yes. If you can get the purple belt, you can get to black belt. You just gotta stay at it and trust the process and keep training hard.

So you got, I mean, you, you took the favorite that you got Strickland. But you got Strickland. Yeah. So you're taking the dog. What do you got? I just, I just, who do you Gotland? I'm rooting for Strickland, dude. But DDP, it's, he's hard Because he's gonna push the pace. And it's really hard If I were to put money out, probably DDP. But I'm rooting for Strickland. Yeah. The only thing about, I like the mustache. I really do. Yep. I like him with the mustache. He's like old Bronson that fucking Yeah, he is psychotic guy. He from Australia. Yes, he is. He looks Strickland. Strickland. He looks like a killer.


He Is. He's awesome. I think he's very focused. I'm fucking fired up for this. His, his boxing's outstanding. It's just, I'm just curious, I just, what changes Strickland can make? He is a great team. I think the best, You know, besides Matt's team, probably the best coaching staff they have. Nick Sick. Who's This? You're saying Nick Sick. This movie looks cool. What is this? Mickey 17, this guy from Alight. What is it Looks like a phone, like Black Mirror Movie. Oh, his hand just got chopped off. He plays the guy that's, Ooh, The director of parasites. He's made into cls a great, and they keep testing him out. He's dying. So they keep testing his, like, what can you what pushing him till he dies. And then they, God transfer his consciousness into a new body. Oh my. And then the clones find themselves. Fuck that. Oh My God. The clones aren't dying. That's like they show on the trailer.


Oh my God. Looks neat, bro. That's a real problem with like, when they can duplicate your consciousness and put it on a hard drive. What's to stop someone like Trump from doing it a million times? I'm gonna have a million to me instead back. I'm Trump. I'm Back. Have a million Trumps. If we get to a point where you can make a clone, and we're probably already done that. China's probably already have clones. I bet they have clones. Trump would already do it. But how old is Trump? He Your dog. Your dog. Yeah. So you could probably clone a person. Yeah. But can you get their consciousness into them? Definitely not. Like twins are different. Yeah. Right. Twins are like pretty close. That, that Thomas Campbell podcast was to me, the most mind blowing thing. Wild Stuff. Right?


Fuck, wild stuff. It's as close to unlocking the secrets of what? Like that's, that might be the new evolution. Like we're, we're going to realize that there's something beyond evolution. Like the, the evolution was, is within a larger umbrella. Which is the notion that this is a, this is a virtual reality. This is a simulation. It's a virtual reality you're experiencing with consciousness. Yes. And consciousness helps form it. Yes. I was literally just experiencing virtual reality. Literally. That's what we're saying. Yeah. I was just playing my fucking game when I knew what you were, when I called you and I couldn't get to you when I was inviting you to dinner, I was like, you's probably got the fucking headset on.

That's what's going on with the shooting. These kids are all head shots. Pop, pop, pop. Do you know they did studies with surgeons and they found that surgeons who played video games make like 25% less errors. Wow. Yeah. Makes sense. It's 37%, 37% less errors. Jesus Christ.

Oh, I'm so pumped for this fight. Yeah. This is wild man. I'm, I'm just curious though, what changes Strickland's gonna make to win more rounds? He does he grapple more to take down? Does hee less grapple less Or more? Does he shoot for Takedowns? He said he thinks he's gonna piece him up. That's what he said. Which means on the feet, jab, teep, a lot of jabs and peeps. I think you're gonna see DP wrestle more. I think he's gonna, I Think DDP is, I think we can see some stricken. 'cause remember this is the same coach that with Francis had him shoot more surprise everybody. Yeah. I think he's gonna, I think he's gonna do a lot of wrestling in this.


That looks legit. That staff on his left arm. That looks legit. That looks like real staff to Me. Yeah, it does. That's not good. Yeah, that looks like real Staff. So he's probably on antibiotics. I gotta think so. And if he is, that's not good for, Unless he said fuck it, let's just go topical. I bet. And Control it. Yeah. He might just control it with topical. Yeah. You don't wanna use antibiotics Because you can, You can control it with topical. If you on Antibiotic, it looks like it got dug out a little bit. Yeah, it looks like a puss. It looks like a big old giant zit. You know, that's where they get scary when they get big. 'cause you think they're getting systemic, You know, they're, get your bloodstream. I Got a boil or something called fako or some shit on my fucking collarbone when I was in Brazil.


Dude, that was the most disgusting shit. Was it? First of All, the mats were disgusting. Was it staff? No, it wasn't staff. I think it's a, it's a, I think they called it a boil here or something. Whatever it was. But just it, it got really big, like a big zit. And then it finally like, comes to a head and then at the end you pull out a little piece of phlegm. It looked like a bullet wound in there. It was fucking, I had cancer on my back. I they took out a squemous cell. Oh yeah. Me. Did you? I did be there. What fuck We had to, We had to, we couldn't let You, Can I beat cancer? Yeah, Cancer. Oh, you had a fucking little puss. I Had cancer. I beat cancer. But it, it kept itching. And I was like, the fuck is, why is this itching? And I went and they took out a piece. Oh, Jesus. And she called me up and she goes, you got a little screen of cell there, man.


It was a while ago. They just gave me a cream. I gotta put on my nose. You see this little mark here? What, what is it? What is it? It's like a little basal cell. The lady said that she's giving some chemo cream. She called, It's a basal cell maybe. Yeah. She goes just, but I didn't want to. I, they said I'll, I'll use this. I'll start it next week. We'll start of a week ago. But, and then, because they're supposed to get like crusty and it's getting all nasty. I'm like, Don't fuck around with something that doesn't, like if it, it keeps bleeding that, that's not A choice. Well, she said to go back to see her after two weeks of using it. Yeah. And she'll know if she has to cut me or anything. Yeah. Take it out. It's from the sun. I like the sun. Man. Sun. Good For you. Dude. It's, I was laying out today in the fucking back of my place.


Good for you. That was Nice out. It's good for you. All that bullshit about the sun being bad for you is nonsense. It's just you shouldn't get over exposure and get burned. Right? Yeah. I don't believe in sunscreen. They're supposed to build up Moderation. You get dark. Yeah. I don't, I don't use sunscreen. Never have. Even as a kid. Good for you. That shit's poison. Yeah. Facts. I mean, they have some like natural sunscreens, but it looks like you wearing black face. Oh no. No. Oh wow. What does natural sunscreen look like? I'll take the sunburn. Like, or you're a goth kid. Sink Cream, you know. Yeah. That's White. So you See parents lathering their kids up with 'em. Like, I've gotta give 'em some sun. Yeah. They need to. Everyone's scared of sunburn and everyone's scared of Depends on Your scan, right? Depends On what's up, Jamie. What's this? You see this fucking mustache I give staff.


I don't fucking get staff. Oh, okay. All right. That was his take on it. You see this fucking, I give staff trickling ass. You got staff. I give staff. I don't fucking get staff. Well that means he has staff. See What, you see what Strickland said at the press conference? He goes, you fight like a, like you ride the short bus like a retard. Yeah, He does fight. And then Dreas goes and you look like the one driving it. That's funny. But the problem with that is like the one driving it is a normal person. Yeah. Not a Good car. I heard. Not a great t didn't work. People liked it though. I just, Yeah. They're dumb. They're dumb. They're not thinking logically. That didn't make sense. I'm fucking pumped. Matt. Coach, what do you think is jacked?


What do you think Matt? You know, I'm, I'm going with Strickland. I made the dec. I feel like Strickland's gonna win by decision, but Smart money's on DDP. You Know why? 'cause I, he adds in those take downs. But he takes away those take downs and he puts a little more stank on it. I feel. Who knows how much that cut really bothered him in that, with that eye. 'cause he's making, he's, I I think he's an honest guy and he's say, and he's saying it fucked with him. You know? I'm Sure it did. I I I, I have to say that that Strickland stands pretty straight up. So he does seem open for take downs and I'm surprised He doesn doesn't get it. Hard take down. I know it's hard to take down. He's hard to take down. I'm Surpris Strickland taken Down is fucking skillful. And he spars so much. I know.


You know, he spars more than anybody in the UFC when they put that mouthpiece in that registers, how many times he get hit? He gets hit Less than anybody. Yeah. Wow. He's the best striking defense ever. Ever. That's why I love watching him. He's amazing. No, he's Going But deep. He's so big. I thought he won the first fight. He a tough puzzle of solve so big. I thought he won the first fight. I, but I thought it was close and Dana thought he won the first fight too. Yeah. And that's probably, he might have been compromised with that, with that eye. So He definitely was. But I think also, I think DRAs is even better. Yeah. I think DRAs just keeps getting better. Yeah. He, he's got that belief in himself. Oh man, that's un Oh and he's huge. When I stand next to him, I can't believe he makes 180 5. I mean literally when in between fights he looks like a heavyweight Explosive.


He's so big. He looked like he was two 40 standing next to Bisbing and Bisbing picture Two 20. Yeah. Well he looked real thin at the weigh-ins yesterday and he looks like he filled in a lot. They interviewed him like pretty much right after he got on the scales. Which I always think sucks. Yeah. Give the guy a few hours. Yeah. You know You're not allowed to do IV IVs. No you're not. Why? I don't know. I think it's stupid. Me Too. I think you can mask. I got an IV today. It was awesome. I Love IVs. IV vitamins and zinc. Whenever I'm feeling kind of shitty, I get an IV. NAD vitamins. Vitamin. Yeah. What About NAD vitamin? They say NAD. Oh it's great. It is phenomenal. What do they say? What do they say to you? Have to shoot it first. It makes you gay. You have to shoot it into your body first Or do you No. You don't take it supplement wise.


You Shoot it. No, You can take, You can take NMN which like helps build up it naturally. Right. 'cause it kind of a similar effect. But I think IV NAD is the most potent form of it. You Take a lot of Stuff. That's right. Bitch. There You go. You're feeling good. I like it. Feeling good at 85 years old. Not bad buddy. You, you're, when are you 58? August. Yep. Is it gonna feel weird when you say you're 60? 'cause it felt weird when I was, when 50 felt a little weird. I don't Damn you 50 baby. Honestly. I'm Fucking 50 bro. Fuck You don't look good. Yeah. Sorry guys. I know you're approaching the other one, but you look good. I'm 50. You look good. I'm 57. I'll be 58. I don't think about it anymore 'cause there's nothing I can do about it.


All I think about is making sure my body works great. Yep. And as long as I stay up on the peptides and the hormones and train All the time and constantly work out, do a bunch of different things. Cowbells, cardio, cold plunge, sauna every day. All these different things, it stays working. But if you look at A 58-year-old from like the 1960s, they were Dead men. They were dead. It's A different thing. Like 50 eight's different than what it was. Bro, I'm sweating. I'm getting ready for this fight. I'm fucking fired up. Oh, it's funny. I get nervous. I can't wait. I'm sweating. DDP has actually skinny legs. So a lot of his weights in his upper Body. I don't know if they're skinny. I mean comparatively, comparatively fucking RA's ass. He's got more ass than Beyonce. Man. That ass is on a different level. I Don't know About that.


Who Pereira you mean? I mean Perra. Oh yeah. My god. Unbelievable Bros. That's the scariest kickboxer that's ever fought in the sport. Oh you, you fuck up one time? Yeah. I just take one. No, no, no. Pereira think one shot what he did to Strickland. Yeah. Greatest defensive fighter We've seen. He just One left hook star difference. Starch though. Tagged him a couple times to the chest, got him reaching for it. Came over with that left hook night night for Izzy's legacy. It's nice he had that one time. It is nice. And the way he did it, the way he And with the arrows at the end, He has, that's enough just to be like, all right. Yeah. You know what? Oh, his legacy. There's, I think with, with Alex, like there's a difference between MMA striking like the elite strikers and then actual elite strikers.


Right. There's a big, he's an actual elite two division glory world champion. Big huge difference. But there's that dude ov that's now in MMA who beat him in glory in his last fight. Close fight decision. Super Controversial fight. Yeah. But he won and he landed more shots than Pereira. And he, he, he's got a style that like doesn't leave any openings. He's like very technical. He's like a really good kickboxer. I don't know what kind of a ground game, if anything. He has, they got DDP listed at six one. Is he, he's not six two, He looks six two to me. Yeah. But those, those guys like that, that are Russian, those Russian dudes, they learn wrestling when they're fucking babies anyway. Yeah. Yeah.


I guarantee that guy has some sort of a sambo background. Definitely. Dude. The shape he's in. Holy shit. He's The strongest. Fuck. Yeah. OV is interesting. 'cause I think he just fought on Dana White's contender series. Did they signed him? I Think they signed him. He's just gonna have that sees that Artem ov if he fought on Dana White's contender series. I think he's just gonna Have a tough path to get to Alex. Yeah. Like Alex was catapult to the front. 'cause Izzy was so dominant. So they sped him to the front. Right. It's gonna be different. No, it's different Also it's different because Alex puts people into night, night land. Yes. Ov won by TKO. Yeah. He won by TKO. OV is fucking good, man. Super technical. Jesus. Here we go. Let's fuck. Here we go. This is an insane way to make a living.


Fuck. Oh my goodness. Oh Fucking love It man. This is it. This is it. Here we go. Here we fucking go. All right. Round one. Let's go Look at that. I'm so curious on the adjustments, they, they, they make, I think Sean fights one way, man. I agree. He's gonna just do more of it. That's what Works. Such A good way. It's such a good way that jab is just so hard to fuck with. Straight up. DDP did a lot of that in that first fight too. That left switch kick beats up the arms a little bit. Getting the old, You know, because even if you block it like that sucks. It's still causing damage. That sucks. I mean it sucks your calf. Imagine why it's doing your forearm.


I know. I mean so many times guys' arms go numb and you just don't know it. 'cause they're still moving around. It's not like a calf where you see him limping. I mean how much does that shit take outta your punching power? That kick? Yeah. He was slick with that. He landed a lot of those in the first fight. It's kind of sucks. He's just, he's a guy that for whatever reason, because the way he moves, people sleep on him. Yeah. They don't give him the Respect. It's weird because He doesn't look like you're conventional elite. Oh, look at that. Yeah. Sneaky question mark kick. He keeps throwing that up to the top. It's quick too. And He's got the endurance that keep throwing them. And there's the low kick too. Sean's Really good at at checking his kicks, but he's not checking these.


Well he does that same style of checking kicks that Pereira does. Got it. From where he kinda hack. Yeah. He hacky sacks. Yeah. You know you turn that foot All the way up towards your knee. Love The jab man. Yeah man, he's, he's so smooth, man. But DD P's doing a smart thing by attacking the legs. Really smart. Attacking the legs and attacking the arm with the switch kick. And then threatening with the high kick. Ouch. Ouch. And ouch. It's just an investment for later round. It's such an awkward way of moving. It's so weird. Like Robert Whitaker and Izzy were talking about. They're like, he's the best shit fighter ever. Yeah. But how do you say that he's a world's, how do you say he's a shit fighter? The guy's a fucking world champion, but it's just, it's awkward but so effective.


Like when he took out Robert Whitaker in the first round, I was like, God, He's powerful, athletic. Oh my God. He's so strong. Just durable. It's durable. It's fucking, This is the old feeling out stage. Right. And that but that move that he's doing. Sean Sean, the Sean's moving back though. It's interesting. Oh, spinning back. Yeah. Well this is where Sean fights at his best. Yeah. But, but DDP is by doing those switch kicks and those low kicks there. He did the hacky sack on that one. Just stand in your grill. Look at Sean. Pop. Pop. That is a dangerous move that left kick. 'cause it's sneaky. He didn't land it to the face in the first fight. But he threatened with it a bunch of times. If he can land that, that's a fucking fight changer.


God look, Sean's so hard to hit. He is man. So hard to hit. Clean his instincts and his timing because he's borrow so much. Dps being Active out there, man. Oh yeah. DPS winning round. Well he's certainly landing more kicks. Yeah. Right. That's what matters for the judges. Well, damage matters. I mean if, if Shawn can get off a one, two, if he could do something significant, but right now it's like just kind of touching him and dd P'S not letting him set up. Nope. He's not letting him get in a groove. Sean does not kick that much, You know. No. And when he kicks it's very linear. He's got a really fucked up le was it right leg? Yeah. It's quad. He doesn't have a quad for Motor. It's motorcycle up for one. Really? He was just riding a motorcycle on the countdown show and fell down.


Yeah. He's crazy. Yeah, he fell down. He's crazy. I mean he's got a giant fight coming up and he's still riding motorcycles. He's too, he was wrestling with guys in Australia on a beach on a bridge throwing him into the water. Yep. Throwing back flips. I saw that. Yeah. It's an animal. He's Getting now pointed right now though. Yeah. Only 'cause he's only 'cause he's not busy enough. Yeah. DD P's winning this round. Well he's definitely more active. Oh, there's that jab. Boy you hit DDP, he gets mad. Yeah, he does. He goes bulldog mode on you. He just gotta do something significant other than just touch him with the jab, Sean.


Yeah. He really doesn't do much more than That. Well he is looking for them openings and Right. Low kick is so nice. Yeah. Timing is so nice. Yeah, this is, And I think DDP just keeps getting better too. That's the thing. Okay. And then as a champion, you know, I mean I think he's got even more confidence. Yeah. I think DDP Yeah. He has a lot more growth and adjustments to make to beat Strickland And the kicks are just a totally different element. Right? Yeah. I mean it's a distance thing. It's a, you know, it's a power thing. You gotta kind of like, you can't fire back when they're hitting you. You gotta really block 'em and think about it. He hasn't even started grappling yet. Right. So that's still in the chamber. It's just Sean is like mostly Tes and then jab one, two.


But it's almost all straight at you. Very few low kicks. This took place in the center. I mean, see it's All the Tes. He's doing a good job of avoiding those big bombs though, that are coming at him. He's so hard to hit man. He is, but he's getting his legs chewed up. Man was first round for Champ. If you're trickling, you go back to the corner like, bud, we can't keep doing this. Yeah. You, you gotta take away those legs feeling 'em, you gotta come. Here's the question down around, is trickling on antibiotics? I mean, looks like a real fucking staph infection. I know Rockhold beat Wideman. He was on antibiotics. You know, guys have won big fights on antibiotic.


That's Gracie one. Yeah. But it's so hard to fight on that stuff. You're, you, your energy is drained The worst. Oh, It's horrible. I Mean he's, unless he's just keeping some, keeping his, keeping his energy. Energy for the later rounds And What the fuck, Matt, is there a way to mitigate the effects of antibiotics? Have you ever heard of anything that that guys take? Nah man. I didn't hear anything like Heavy probiotics. Is there anything that you can take that? No, I have no clue. Dude, I, I know Rab fought his first fight when he was getting over something and I still think he won. He got robbed. But he was on know it antibiotic. It hits your Heart. Either he was on it. I knew he just got over it. But I mean, I think it was The end. They said that last fight Robb had a horrible staph infection on his shin. Oh yeah.


That He had a bad, bad problem. I broke my back. I The shin. He just like, bad. Rob, you won. You won. There we go. One round. DDP. All right, Let's go. We go, Let's go. Let's see what adjustments Strickland makes. I don't think he's gonna make any adjustments. I think he's gonna, He's gotta busier. Well, he's gotta make some adjustments to deal with these kicks. He's gonna lose five rounds if he doesn't change. And DD p's gonna start wrestling soon too. Because once Strickland starts committing, he's gonna start shooting. DDP is so sneaky with that high kick. That's a nasty high kick man. And there's a low kick in. He's check that one. Yeah, he Checked it. He's gotta get through that shell, man. Sean's Gotta get a little loose.


Yeah. He, he's gotta do something big, big that He got his bike. He's gotta be frustrating that you can just do whatever you want to. DDP and he just swarms it. Oh, There again, he is sneaking that kick in. He's gotta get busier. See, see Strickland's doing a great job of avoiding a lot of shots, but he's just not doing much. Right. And DDP keeps chopping at the legs. Yeah. It's not everything in a fight, but it's something, you know, it's like headshot that's been landed. Yeah. In this fight. It's everything. It's the only Thing. Yeah. It's all that's been landed to the body again. He's catching his elbow Though. With Yeah, but still. Thats horrible dude.


It's still points still be. Yeah, It's something. Yeah. It's the most, oh, there's a right hand over the top. He needs a little more of that. Oh, here we go. He wants to start wrestl or DDPs and Start wrestling. Yeah. I I, I'm surprised. Yeah, There's Imagine part of the game pass Wrestling. Oh, here you go. Strickland's turning the gas. This is what we need. Strickland's hitting the gas now we need this. He, he can't leave these rounds in the hands of the judges this's the second round already. Oh. Again, Checked it. I know, but it's still, it's like he's keeping him off balance with all that shit. He's looking and every time he goes to set up, which he sets up with everybody, DDP is just constantly doing this low kick with the right coming.


There it is. He's, it's like he's constantly got these patterns that he throws in this, in that stance. It's the switch. Switching Up. Yeah. Sean's coming forward. Oh's a left hand. Oh, he landed that left hand. He's coming forward. That cut his lip. Yeah, it did. Yeah. Because he is landing that in the transitions of these. Oh. Oh, That was a Nice counter. Nice right hand. Nice right hand. Oh yeah. Just no. Oh there it is. There it we go. There it is. You gotta put yourself a little in home's. Way to do home. Yeah. Let's fucking go. That's a fast front check kick, Man. I mean, he needs to get DDP to start engaging in a boxing slug fest. 'cause he, he's DDP is doing such a smart move with mixing and all these kicks. Kicking. Kicking which fucks with everything.


It fucks with your ability to time everything. Yeah. And you have to keep getting reset. You get keep reset and every time you do it, he hits you again with it. Yeah. He's not letting him get comfortable. Oh, Strickland's Nice. Sean, Where's he bleeding from? Where's Strickland mouth? His lip, His mouth. He got caught with a jab. He's having a way better round though. He's also much more aggressive. Yeah. Much more forward. This Is it. This is it. Yeah. Sean, let's go America. America. He's getting in his zone now, man. Damn. Sean can just stand right there and just, He can celebrate in the frustrating in the Gulf of America after this.


Oh, nice. Inside low kick. Let's Fucking kicks are a pain In the ass. They're a pain in the ass. 'cause he's constantly resetting you. Yep. You know, again, like he's constantly reset. He never gives you a chance. There again. High kick. He's just low kick. So the game was kicks the game. Yeah. And the fucking, it's a smart game plan match until Sean shuts it out. He's just gonna keep doing it. Well he keep rounds the keep doing this. He can keep doing this. Yeah. He's spanking rounds and it's gonna take Sean's legs away from him if he keeps doing it. I mean, Sean, as tough as he is, can only take so many of those fucking kicks to the legs. Dude. He keeps throwing. But he's, he checked that one. He's Constantly throwing shit. I know. But even checking them and they fucking below a bitch. They suck. Yep. Come on man.


He, his left leg is all welted up. Make it ugly man. Gotta make it ugly. Yeah. He's gotta, he's gonna have to stop. Just sit on the outside. There's the jab. Right hand of the body. Nice. Fucking nice. There's another hard low kick. Man. These are hard kicks man. They're a bitch. It's part of, you know, the game that Sean just doesn't do. It's interesting 'cause he's so good but it's like such a specific attack. But he's so good at it. Oh, oh, he snuck it in again. Yeah, but he touched him with that. Grazed him. Look at That. I mean, he's not getting that. You gotta realize that Counts. Counts. It does count. 'cause Sean definitely doesn't want him kicking him in the face.


Good. Ouch. Isn't his right hand? Ouch. That's a nice right hand. Oh He's Now that makes, let's go, let's go Third, fourth is gonna be interesting. Caught him there. It is crazy when you look at Sean's style, like who fucking fights like this Stands totally straight up. Does mostly practice. Yeah. That's part of why he doesn't have as much power though. Yes. But it's also why he's so fucking hard to hit that Hell Yeah. He's great defense. Best defense in, in the game. That's a, what do you think of that? Round? Close. It's closer. It was closer. But he might have been more active. It seemed like. He definitely landed more kicks. But Strickland landed a few good punches in that round. At least it was a Better round for him.


But now he's he Great condition. Look At that. You can strikes 28 to 17. Shit. Wow. He's just more active. More active. So Strickland's down two rounds now. Yeah. Yeah. He's got a, he's I'm sure Nick six's letting him know And dd P'S gonna keep doing it. And what Strickland's Just that. Then he starts who's, that's Such a great coach. It's his, the guy with the red hair. Yeah. Great coach. Such a great coach. Whoever said Shama Chama, he's Chama. There's that kick. There's a nice jab Right hand over the top. Yeah. You gotta do some more of that. Slips that shit. Look at that. Think it's, Sean just gets just out of the way of the danger zone.


Yeah. It's, it's just touching him Great eyes. Like you can just boom. Well he spars so much man. And there's something to be said for that. Yep. Something to be said for that. 'cause that's like the majority of his training is sparring. I think he spars without a headgear too and all. 'cause it's just, You know, Let's go, let's go round three. Let's go. Trick is just constant with these kicks. Fuck. And it's just like, it's such an obvious pattern too. He does it over and over again. He's got, look, he's, you see him trying to get into Ena Trick's gonna have to take some chances here. Yeah, he, that was a good check. He checked with the other leg.


He's gotta get something off and really win around definitively and push, push a harder pace. 'cause this shit like DRAs could do this from the outside and he keeps having to reset. Oh. Oh nice. That little stutter step. See that little stutter step? He's Okay. Reach is so weird. He's in shape. Fucking Drake is. Oh yeah. There is fucking check that one. Constantly Throwing shit. He's more busy, that's for sure. Yeah. It's like Sean is just not getting a chance to get things off. Like the, the, the time he's looking for the openings, they're just not there. But as it gets into the pace, if trick, I mean trick is expending a lot of energy fighting like this.


And, And Strickland usually gets way stronger than the rear Goes. Oh boy, there it goes. Yeah, I like that to the body too. More of that shit. One, two and the Hotman. Yeah. More than one punch. More than two. Mix it up. What a crazy style. Yeah, Both of 'em. I mean very few round kicks. Just Tess reaching a lot of jabs. Right hands. I see. I could see Strickland doing the bad knuckle eventually. No. Oh yeah. He Could do it. I could see him doing that. Yeah. He'd probably want to do it too. Connor keeps talking about doing it. That might be the next time we see him. Yeah. A good chance against Jeremy Stevens. Oh my God. Imagine that. Yeah. He probably said it after he had a lot of caffeine.


Do you think we'll Ever see Connor in the caffeine? I don't know if Connor's ever gonna fight again. He's worth so much money. Yeah, I don't think So. It's hard when the guy's worth that much money. And then when he got saucy, What's gonna be scary with him in his own life is when he's at a limelight. 'cause I think he's a dude that likes the limelight. You can tough for him. Yeah. What's gonna happen when he's an older fighter now or retired? Yeah. Officially no one's expecting him back. Now what? Right. Does he get crazy? Yeah. Because That's why he keeps teasing the fight, sustaining the news. But Eventually, hundred Percent. That was a good right hand by Strickland. S go Sean. It's just DDP does not give you much chance to set up.


Man. It's a weird shit like that. Strickland Just has to hope He kind phases. I Feel like he just needs to, to just, it's not gonna fade. Make this uglier. Like he's gotta get closer to him. It's just Not his style. Mm. Oh oh, did he catch that? Yeah, he got him a little bit with that. That's been, it's just, just grazing him. He just, God, he's constantly, he never rests. And he's another guy relies on his fitness too. 'cause this is an exhausting style man. Oh Wow. When you're walking in that ring and you're like, all right, five rounds, you know it's probably going five. He's, it's all exploding and like closing distance. That's a nice kick to the body kick.


He's never stopping man. He just does not give trickle Strickland a chance to reset. And Strickland's gotta get something big off. 'cause this could be the round that makes it outta reach. Strickland seems a little bit, I wanna see what happens if he loses this round. He's gonna have to be going for broke. Right. Because what he, this is the round that passes him like to a point where he can't win a decision. Yeah. Strickland comes on heavy in the fourth and fifth. But that the, their last fight, Strickland didn't do much in the fourth and fifth. Yeah. But so does Drikus. That's the problem there it is. He's gotta like do something, put a stamp on this round. Like wobble him. Yeah. He's got, he's gotta put it on him. He's gotta win this round. Oh nice. I spent That elbow landed, flushed.


I'm telling you man. And because he's unable to pressure him, he's still looking fresh. Oh, You caught him with right hand there. Open it up a little. Now It's just, he's not getting a chance to get that offense off. It's very impressive. Just, he never gives him a chance to set up. Always. I'm Just surprised. Duple isn't going for like a singular double. He Doesn't need to. Yeah. Why would you? Yeah, you're up three rounds. Speed. Yeah. Why would you risk it and get more tired? 'cause he can do this for five rounds. Oh, he clipped him there. There You go. That was a crazy like swinging right hand. He still has that in his back pocket. Look at out. Fucking kicked out.


Oof. It was hard. Low kick. Yikes. That's kick His low and hard. There You go. There You go. There You go there, There. And That's the round. Listen to Coach Callen. And that's the round. Gotcha. You, We worked on wrestling. Guys Upped his feet. Sure. He gotta do much the takedowns because Sean gets back. But he's gotta give It to him now for him. He's gotta give it to him. There it is. Yeah. Go over the Shit. He's got a really good, Seans down three rounds. Yeah, He's down three rounds. That's And he knows it. Yep. And he fucking knows it. That's rough. He seems a little lackadaisical. I wonder if it's the antibiotics. Yeah. I wonder. Or is it DDP style? It's both. It's a problem. It might be both. Hard to, Yeah, probably both. Probably come by both. I wonder what Nick's saying to him here.


We gotta open up. Take some chances. He's Not taking this, Shawn's not taking any damage at all. It's just he's getting his legs kicked and it's just scoring. No, He is, he's losing the fight. Yeah. He's saying you gotta push here. We see If I'm, Yeah. All right. He says boom. Look at that good right hand by Sean. Yeah. Boom. Oh, he caught him with that Man. He got him with That one. This is his elbow. Boom. Yeah, but he caught him with his like back Of his arm. That was nice. Yeah. Yeah. Instead of the flush elbow. He's gotta get, fuck he, he, he looks a little, he's gotta get going.


He's a little tired actually there. Yeah. It could be the pace, but it could be the fucking antibiotics too. Yeah. We're not gonna know later. Nice kick to the body again. Yeah, it's A pain in the ass. A front foot kick though. Right. So it's not as powerful, But Yeah. But it's landing O'Brien, it scored. Right. It's losing rounds. Yep. I like that. A chin, chin, chin. I like that shit. That chin, chin, chin, chin. That was nice. Come on, Shawnee. He's Gotta put it on him though. He's gotta really put it on him this round. Yeah. He doesn't seem to be falling up that right hand. But it's tough to put it on 'cause fucking DDP is so dangerous.


Well you don't wanna get in a slug fest with DDP, right? Yeah. But you kind of have To, It's like the other choices. You stay back and you lose a fourth round, now you're down four zero. At A certain point you gotta throw caution for the win, man. If You want the win, you gotta say fuck It. Listen, you wanna hurt him. You're gonna be there to get hurt, but you're gonna have to take that chance. Yeah. Otherwise you're just gonna, it's gonna go this road. What we're doing now is not working. Yeah, Yeah. But it is a pain. The ass, every time you come close, you get kicked in the stomach and fucking just, ugh. You know? It's just the conditioning of Ooh, nice. Right hand. The conditioning to fight like this. Oh, he hurt him. He Hurt him. He hurt him. He did hurt him. And he, he him. Yeah. They break his nose. The bridge of nose. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. He's trying to fix it, it looks Like. Yeah. Seans trying to fix his, he got caught his, he caught It.


Looks like he's trying to straighten it out. Damnit. Yeah. That sucks. His nose is broken. Smell his nose is Broken. He smells it too. He's, he must have felt it too. Maybe when he punched him, what Did he just hit him with that? I don't know, man. But all of a sudden it's getting weird. Look at his nose. That nose is a mess. That's Not good. He got his nose. It's Like it's painted red. Oh. Who knows What the fuck he felt if he, this Is V. Oh my God. He's leaking. It is a big round for the champ. Oh, right hand. Another one. Oh Man, they, they say they damage doesn't, it's Gotta be. Fuck. Rick is just such a fucking bulldog dude. Rick is Smelling blood now. But you gotta be careful. Not fun to fight. You can't breathe broken nose.


Fuck This. Ah, that's, it's a rough fucking game. Strickland's defense. So fucking good. God. Still good. Still Good. Duple is just wild. Yeah. He can't touch that nose. Reckless. I mean, he sees him with this nose like this. This, Yeah. A little tired. Little tired. Of course. Come on Sean. Of course. Look at this style. But the thing is, he never stops coming at you like this. Even though he is fucking ex dog tired. He's so game. Oh man. This is a nailbiter right here. What is It is like he has these patterns that he sets up with. Oh shit Man. Big breath By DVP.


Well Sean's nose is destroyed. Yeah. If he touches him there. One more time. Fuck that. It's fucked. Oh, nice. Right hand by Sean. Yeah, Sean. Since he busted his nose to him way better, he kinda said fuck it. Now he's sitting more in the pocket. Well he is got a Oh, oh. We tagged him again. He's gotta realize he's, that's what you gotta worry about. He's in trouble. Yeah. It's not, I mean, he's down. This is like four rounds. Yep. Wow. More significant damage done too. Man. I just, It's like that Rory McDonald nose that time. Oh, I couldn't see. Oh, the Rory said he went, my face was went With Robbie.


Lola. He was never really the same after that. No, never. Oh, right hand. Right hand by Trius. That was a big one. Can't breathe. Fuck this. Yeah. Shit. Ugh. It must be like just fuck These Aren't fuck this knife right hand. He's just gotta Fuck it doesn't, doesn't feel fight anything punches though. Woo. Drake is just so wild. Look at this. Just exploding man. The guy's got such fucking cardio for a, a guy who explodes like this. It is so impressive that he could hold up this pace deep into the fourth Because He always looks like he's in the, like in the brink of slowing down.


Yeah. And it never happens. Oh my goodness. Jesus Christ. Man. Dude, 40 more seconds of this. Oh, right hand. He's rolling with it. But still, God DRAs is just swinging for the fences with every punch. I feel like ever since has hurt his nose. He's getting a little sloppy. He's trying to zero in. Well he just can't get hit there again. You know, I mean, it's destroyed. And he really hasn't been able to hurt him. He hasn't done one thing that really rocked him.


There's Nothing significant by Strickland. But you have to, even if he does the fucking windmill on the next round, he's gotta do something. Man. He's gotta throw some shit. He's gotta stop him. He's, he's down four rounds. I don't know. He's gotta stop him down Four Rounds. Look at his nose. Oh my God. Look at his nose. Dude. It's shattered. That's what he tried to do. You saw him trying to push it back into place. Yeah. Fuck. Oh my God. It's shattered. That's, that's rough man. Fuck dude. Alright. Hey listen Steven, you need to finish. You already know that. Right? You need to intercept his combinations. You can't fucking just stand there and take him off. You've gotta intercept his combination. It's gotta be an elbow. Oh Jesus Christ. Hey, You've gotta get this shit going right Now.


Sucks. Oh, look at that Bo. Oh my goodness. Let, It's crazy that he had to touch it. That's crazy. Trying to Set it. I think he said he reset it. Yeah. He goes I said it. I said it. Yeah. But that's how crazy that punch was. Anybody take chances, take risks. Gotta take chance. It's fucking, It's great coaching. Push that. Chances take risks, push that. Ooh, all or nothing go out on your shield. That's, that's the only thing you can tell him. Hey Listen, I know's a 220 pound South African world class fighter take chances. Get crazy. Yeah. Get crazy. Good Luck. Oh hey, before you go out there, you got a broken nose. Have fun. He reset it. He's probably had his nose broken in many fights.


Oh yeah. But far Nose. He keeps touching it though. Which is not good. It might be like moving around. He might feel, feel the bones moving around. Oh man, I'm DDP. I'm shooting some take downs here. Hell, There You go. That's exhausting too. And he can't hold him down, so. Yeah. Yeah. True. You know, he might say, fuck it. Yeah, this is working. John's gotta really hit the gas. He's gotta really hit the gas. He gonna let everything out here. Yeah. He's gotta push It throw even at the wide punches, just Throw. But he's so responsible defensively, it's hard for him to just enter when he knows he is open. I I, I know the fan base's gonna hate on DDP 'cause they're gonna say it's not exciting dude. He's dominated shit. Oh, This is exciting as fuck Man.


It's been a one side show. This is exciting as fuck. The fans that don't like this are not fans. They just, just, people want blood technical. Yeah. It's a good fight man. It's like his strategy. He's so smart. He chops at the legs constantly. Yeah. That kept him off balance. Kept him switch, kicked to the body and then to the head. He's landed the bigger shots for sure. There's another one. Bigger shots. Keep Pressing the action. Yeah. And, and he's not letting Sean set up. Like Sean always wants to move forward and set up and he is just constantly chop at the leg. Do do we know Kate side? Because I'm sure he'd jump in the ring. 'cause that's next for sure.


Yeah. You think so? That's next. Yeah, that's next. That's another spin, two spin in a row. That's gonna be, I'm really excited about. Oh, the comms out. That'd be wild man. He's not changing the way he fucking fights. No, No. And I mean, Kenrick has stopped that take down Ken Hamza. I don't know. Fuck around in the third, fourth, fifth round. Right. Because this guy, guy Kent's so compelling. Yeah. This guy's so fucking game. I mean he's always there in the fight. I was impressed with Whitaker keeping his calm until he got his face crushed. I'm like, look, he's keeping his calm And then he has his whole teeth Broken. Yeah, it's rough man. Apparently he had a weak jaw anyway, like that area. He broke his teeth. He was born I guess. No, I thought it was an injury. Were fucked up. Oh really? Yeah. He was born. Yeah, he was born Something with his two, his bottom teeth.


So he's had a, a few of 'em replaced before. Yeah, he's hopefully they did a good job this time. He's Got a new grill now. Screwed him in deep. Alright. Sean does not have much here. He's not showing anything that could end the fight. I mean he's really gotta open up, but he doesn't want to get coed. He's tough with that broken nose. Yeah. I mean this is how he fights. Right. He fights responsible. He's not gonna like go, he's guy go reckless. He's, no, it's just not in his, no, his whole DNA Oh oh. He tried for a guillotine. Imagine He got a fucking yellow DA. That'd be hilarious. That would be great. He is a black belt in his DNA. Sean's got an underrated ground game. Is he a black? I'm think he's a black belt. He's a black belt. Yes. Yes he is. From who? I don't know Man.


It's just, this is the way it's gonna go though. Yeah, yeah. You know, you gotta realize you're not Also, it's like this is the last round two 15 to go and this has been most of the fight like this. That's it. Just make a decision. Just throw. Yeah. And you can't wait. 'cause you wanna try to take this guy out. Like you gotta get this guy. But the thing is like, it's easier. Like you just hit him again on that nose. I know. And he's feeling it, man. Yeah. Oh yeah. It's gotta suck. Oh it sucks. Look, he hit it again. It's fucking pouring blood. And now he's only breathing out of his mouth. So he's got his mouth open. It affect your cardio Like a motherfucker. Oh. Took that kick to the body. That was a hard kick. Dre is, is just on him, man.


Yeah, Well and Crazy fight. Yep. Kick to the body again. And then as soon Astrom wants it gets something going outta range reset. Now it's like you're already like fucked up so you might as well just fucking just throw. Yeah. Yeah. But it's like, deal with it. It's so hard for him to just open up. Yeah. And put himself in danger. It's not In his Nature. Not, and he's got a fucked up nose. Yeah. Hey listen, it's always easier when we sitting. I get it. But No, it's way easier when you're fighting. No, you're wrong.


Oh, Head kick. Got you. Got a minute left though. To make something happen. You gotta, yeah, you gotta go. You know, or else we're all Fucked up. Like if, if this was flipped and you tell DDP, hey you gotta get him outta there. He's coming out like a fucking South African great white, you know? Yeah. Because that's in his nature. God. You gotta throw caution to the wind now, man. Against your nature. Or not. 40 seconds. Oh, another kick to the body. He just out class Strickland. I mean Strickland needs something real big. 30 seconds to go. Dude, this fight's over less France. Oh right hand. Nice. Unless he tags in Francis and gone. Oh jab 10 seconds left. Even Then, even then, Oh no, Francis is, I would've loved to have seen Alex at middleweight against DDP.


That would've been very interest. Two interesting. Alex. And so he's gonna fight hums. Then you get Alex at 2 0 5, that's five. And then DD p's. Oh dd P'S not become a superstar off this fight, but he beats ham's out. Now we're cooking with gas. That was an ass whooping. You know, technical ass whooping. I wonder if there's more to it. I wonder if there was something up with him. Something. It didn't look like the normal Strickland, right? Yeah. Yeah. But DDP fought real well man, you just kept, I'm not taking it away. Strickland didn't have that gas. He usually has. Well he might have had staff something. You might have had staff. Yeah. We never know. You know. But You were wrong at that one. I was wrong. That One running rough night for America.


The smart money Was on DP. But I have to go strong. Is it comms out versus Drake Is next? Yeah, because Even in the press conference, DDP goes, I wish I was fighting hams out this weekend, but this will do. Did We ever see him fight a, a really good grappler Hamza? Not comms tomorrow? No, no. DD No. We haven't seen DDP fight anybody that level. He's, but Hamza's the highest level in the sport. But even wrestlers, I, I don't remember seeing him. Who's he fought? That's really looking to put him down. No, we never seen him off his back. Boom. It was that big right hand that changed everything. There was a nice elbow, that spinning elbow, this one right here. Boom. That was the fuck That one, that was the game changer.


That Was game game changer. I mean that look at his Eyes, that changed the whole whole fight. Rolled his head back. Some Was never the same. If that broke, it Was fucking rough. Man. Such a smart strategy, Matt. There's that high kick to the face. Ouch. But he's, he's still very good at taking, You know, getting hit and he, He gave him a lot to look at there. Lot to, what Are you saying? He didn't take as much damage but that that Look At his fucking face. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. That That one. You mean Sean didn't take as much damage? No, he took damage. He got hit more in this fight than I think any fight. Right. Any fight other than the re fight Was, he's able, that was quick. He's still able to kind of like Brian, his nose is shatter, shattered. It was one big punch that fucked things up. Mostly bro. He got beat up. Like Brian, his nose is shattered. He got beat up. He got fucked up. He got beat Up. One good shot to his face.


You know, it's Fucked. I'll tell you Drake is looks great. What kind of, what kind of, he's got a, that's an operation right? I mean he's gotta now get it all fucking set. Yeah. Clear unanimous decision. So they probably gave Strickland the fourth round. Yeah. Yep. Trick his two plus C gentleman. He's a problem man. He was a tough puzzle to figure out. He's a tough puzzle if someone's, he figure out. Very tough fight to figure out. Big fucker for 180 5 too. That's a big fucker. Smart. I want to see that fight though. Smart fighter man. He did a fucking great job of setting up, throwing that low kick switch kick to the body.


Kept that pace up for the entire five. Where you want just about everyone. Absolutely. I mean I said it before, Crank that shit up. I'm hear what he says. I gave, I gave him my, oh I'm sorry I couldn't get him outta here, but I hope you guys enjoyed it. I had be a bit smarter about it. Thank you Cindy for showing me love. I know you guys proved me, but the end of a fight. An absolute And what he's deserving of a lodge. Thank you Cindy.


You are incredible. You a nice guy. This guy classy. He's a class Act. Classy Class. Act, yeah. Wrestling Allowed for you to win the fight. You said you were not forced to take down, you got won this fight, you won this fight strike. Did You know that you'd be able to do that? Being that Sean strip in such talent strike? Yeah, that was my game plan. I said when you make a fact about striking, I knew that there's a chance he's gonna, he's gonna arrest, try and wrestle me. But obviously the man doesn't mentor to war me. He was just straight about it. He wants to stand back and I was willing to give that. I tried to force him to make it ing fight, then I can engage. I got that take down. I didn't plan it, but it was there. I took it and since I made the achilles quote of making facts, I said there are no facts between Lions and Ben.


This is another one of Achilles. And since he stand across the ex, the gon is there. No one else is there. No one. He's talking to Hamza. You're talking to Alex Pereira. Oh wow. Ooh. Here. That's gonna be a different game. Oh yeah. That's a night night when you get Game. It's a very different game. Yeah. See is using fucking wrestle men to try To finish. Yeah. I mean I probably know. Probably get tased. You know he said his coach tass him. Fuck. They tase him.


What they tase him in. True. When they do something wrong, they tase him. Really? Oh yeah. His coach has one of those fucking police things. Get arrested American bro. It sucks. He just said a probably get tased punch Back. Took me about 30 seconds to a minute to get Everything. That fight wasn't close fellas. Nope. Fight wasn't. He keeps getting better. Let, he's got his endurance. He can't even stop talking. Look at this guy Like that. I want hear what Sean has to say. Thank You so much. Me Too. I hope he doesn't bring up the staff. He can't, right? Can't can't talk about that tomorrow. Too soon. I hate with fighters. That's when they say too soon. Yeah. Talk about that tomorrow maybe.


Maybe DC asks him. I would definitely ask him. Was that staff? What do you want antibiotics? I would've been probably my first questions If you ask it, it's fine. I'm just like, Yeah, some staff would. Was there anything surprising you with this fight? But I Don't deal with staff, but that's not the reason I lost. All right. All credit To DDP. Right. Let defense talk for you. But is that staff Obviously the fight. Was there anything that was surprising above this that you didn't experience in fight number one? I'll make this quick. We can take this for a sec. Hey, I fucking love you guys, man. I broke without fucker broke my nose. I was like, oh, that doesn't fucking feel right.


Popped it back in place. I kept buying for you. The Dutch man is a bad motherfucker. He kicked my ass. Very square. Drops a hit. Take your microphone DC I'm leaving. But hey you guys, I fucking love you guys. You fuel me and I would break my nose for you fuckers. Any day in the week. Have a good, Alright, Give it up. It's a good night, fellas. Good night. It's a good night. I had a good Time. Well, Let's start. Are you giving a teaching a jujitsu class now or are we gonna wait a little Bit? I do a map. I glad you showed It. I need to stretch a little bit. Oh, Brian.


All right. Oh man, good times. That was fun. Good times. That was fun, man. Thanks for having me. Did You feel down, old down La Sean got beat up. Everybody Kind of root for him. Thought I thought it'd be more Competitive. Very impressive. He, he fucking, He's not gonna beat that guy. Jimmy Norton beat me in the picks a little fucker. Did he? I think he picked both Drake. But now it's crazy. It's, I thought Robert Whitaker was gonna give him problems with that style. I really did. I thought Robert Whitaker with his leaping in style and he's like very light on his feet fast as shit. I thought he was gonna give him problems and DDP shut that shit down and then fucked him up. Caught him with that right hook. See, I I, I would give DDP the, the advantage of hams out right now.


Not to Bet on it. It's hard to say. It's, we don't know what happens to Za there suddenly question marks. We don't know. Hamza just shoots from like 15 feet away and gets ahold of your legs. Of course when I Look at Kamar, he didn't do that to Kamar. Usman didn't do it to Gilbert Burns. He, we go on the third, fourth and fifth. He gave Usman for the first three rounds a nightmare. He was Taken down but he couldn't finish him. That's that's an older Usman. That's true. That's not a vintage Usman who was in their prime duty P he was taking him down decisively. Who was Hamza supposed to fight? That was a last minute replacement was Usman And they put in That's right. And then they put in Kevin Holland. That would've been horrible. That would've been been bad. That would've been horrible if U Ffc was like, we're getting backlash. That would've been, we're getting some backlash here. Let's Kevin you down. He is like, I guess that Would've been Crazy.


Stalls make fights and you never seen. Drake is fight of a good wrestler and comms out's one of the best. And you gotta think his endurance is probably gonna be better at 85 than it was at 70 because of the cut. Yeah. For Hamza is like 85 is really where he should have been all along. But again, he gassed out against Usman. That was that 85 Usman went up to 85. Well Oman's a world champion, You know, and the third round Usman did what a world champion does. He rallied and then Oman's fucking dangerous stand world champion's a good shots. And he's bigger. Yeah. Oh yeah. You Look at Gilbert too. Gilbert. Gilbert weathered the storm and then he gave him hell Dana White confirms Hamza Shamiah was next. Wow. That's fight before the fight though. I wonder where that is.


He's, that's gotta be vague, right? I'll tell you Homicide, that's gonna be Saudi Arabia. You think so? I think he's got a UAE passport now I think To America. Trump. Yeah. Yeah. I think he gets to America now. I mean it's not like, like share a bullet. Probably never gonna fight in America. He can't let him. One eyed fighter condition. Now if you can have one eye fighter, Apparently the UAE is having a problem with it too. Yeah. What do you mean be cool man? United Arab Emirates? Yeah. Like when he fights in D in Abu Dbi, they're, you only got one eye. It's kind of crazy. Yeah, But They still do it. Well They let him do it in Saudi Arabia, you know? Yeah, true. He's The captain now.


I'm Very curious about that shot Comes out, fight What fight they can make. Puzzle MVP is what a puzzle. Yeah. I mean Sharp bullets couldn't do nothing to him. But even on the feed, Ian Gary was getting lit up too. Yeah, Ian Gary had to wrestle. He Just had a wrestle. Ian Gary impressed me even with his loss with Shop Cut. Oh yeah. He Was the closest to ending it. Great. Yep. And he's well-rounded. Great. Great fight. Oh, You can get, be a champion. Yeah, he's, oh great. Yeah, he's Championed and you need a fight like that. Super close fight. I mean, you know the biggest disappointment this year, the Armi and pulling out the day of the fight that Do we, what the fuck happened there? Backseat Up you. Yeah. Wake cut. I mean you gotta think how much is, I think wake up. How much is that guy cutting to get to 55?


And How juicy was I I'm saying he's on pd. I'm saying what I'm saying juicy. Like how much muscle Muscle did he put on a lot and then he cut all that weight. He's five Seven though, right? He's really short. He's probably five eight and he probably walks around one 90 Jacked. I mean he's thick. You see him off season, he's fucking thick And you're not and you're not getting that fight. D was like, he's back in the line now. You're like, really? There's no way. That's a back back issue. You think it's a weight issue? Yeah. Yeah. I think that he said something is a way of doing it. He's Big, like I think number one lightweight arm on secret and Michael Chandler our negotiation for a fight at Miami. Oh Shit. That's a tough fight with Chandler. He resumed training is nearly a hundred percent after back injury. Forced him outta the fight. I think it's just the weight. I think you cut that much weight. Your muscles just cramped the fuck up and he, he couldn't move.


Apparently that's what was happening to Kabi. Remember he missed a lot Hip Tony Ferguson. He kept getting fucked up with his kidneys and All the weight cut. Just think about how much weight that is that you're draining outta your body. Like Ian's probably getting at least 25 jugs of water out of his body. 25 1 pound jugs of water. He's not a big guy. Yeah. Think about a 16 ounce, like a Pepsi. Yeah. He's getting 25 of those out of his muscles. That's crazy. Nobody works around on, I think he's gotta be 180. He looks big man. He's so, and do you see how fucking mobile that guy is when he is doing all his different like mobility exercises? He's so flexible.


Crazy back. Shit. I don't think so. Shit. I think it's All the weight. I think it's a weight cut Issue. Yeah. 1 55 was hard for me to get to too. It was Fucking, isn't it? The worst part of the sport is the, the weight cut that that they do that 25 hours before a cage fight. It's so crazy. Oh shit man. Well now this guy's fucking at one 70 that are like six foot five. I would've been really up to date. They would've been holding my head. That would've been, Who's that guy that Joaquin Buckley beat. He had to take him down. He was, he was beating him up on top buckle. Big fucking tall dude who was, yeah, huge. It was a dangerous fight for Joaquin at once. He guy's big for one 70. Like real tall. Super tall. It looked awkward.


Yeah. Tall and long. I didn't know they had a what mouthpiece That guy was, boy. Oh Yeah, that's Right. That guy's good dude. I'm telling you. Buckley at six foot five. What? 1 76 foot 5, 1 70 I I had the belt it that weight. Five six. What would That look like? Buckley's? Probably five 10. That's crazy. Isn't that crazy? Five dude. 85. Man. Where he doing good? 85. You flip it around. It's my height. Got A big head. Buckley did a fucking amazing job in that fight. How did he lose that fight? Was it a decision or did he, do you know why? Yeah. Do you know decision unanimous? Did ever find out Why Za Beat just stopped fighting. He was so good. Yeah. I don't know man. He was so good. God, he was good. He looked like a world champion and But he became a doctor or something.


Right? Maybe he decided fuck It. I think he did become a doctor. Did he a doctor? Is he a nurse? He's like a gay lord fucker. Hey, I think he said doctor too. I mean he Is a nurse. He said not a trans nurse have to go through some pretty, a real doctor. Did he fight a 45? He was like six two or something or Yeah. Yeah. He was tall as fuck. Mark Henry said he is the best fight he's ever seen. Yeah. He said he was a hundred, a hundred percent world champion training. He was like, he Was wild. He fuck outta jail. He had, he had a good sparr with he with with Henzel, with fucking anal Joe at Longo's. Really? Yeah. And he throws wild shit, man. He was, he was. He was. That guy was good. He had it all wrestling, striking everything man. Yeah. Everything super technical. Yeah. Yeah. Well he ducked as a beat.


No, stuck as a beat. Maybe He just decided this is not for me. Fuck it. You know? He's really a smart guy. Yeah. He's gonna Be a doctor. Lot other options. I mean, how's it end? I mean also if you're a doctor, you really know what's going on with your brain, correct? Correct. And you keep sparring started. I kept thinking about that. The more we learn started, I keep looking at that shit and the more we learn, I'm just like 10, five years from now when you have some kind of an AI mouthpiece and they're just able to fucking correlate how much damage is. When is the comeback za be? Oh, he, he training footage does? No, he just stays in shape. Really? Yeah. Are you sure? Yeah. Break silence with a impressive training clip can bigger. Wait, let's see what his training clip looks like. Let's see. Oh, throwing a lot of kicks.


They could just be just speed in shape, man. Yeah, probably. Who knows? And do a job. I don't know. Maybe he's fucking, looks like he's fucking training again. Yeah, he does. Look at It man. I hope he comes back. He's so awesome Dude. He's awesome. He was wild to watch. Yep, he was wild. Did he ever lose? Not in the UFC. I don't know if he had any defeats in his career. Amazing. Did Zaed have any defeats in his career? Young Jamie. Phenomenal. Look at Dean Thomas with the plaid shirt on. Oh dude. Every time you look, you see Dean Thomas Everywhere's Great. He's always, he's got the sharpest clothes when he is at the UFC sometimes. Does the comment He does close. Like He loves, he loves to be busy. That Guy. What did the beat?


Yeah. Earlier in his career on the ufc. Oh. Early than his crew. But he kind of went out on top. Yeah. I mean who knows. It might not stop. Yeah, He was supposed to be, it was him and Tati las to be the What if 2019 was his last fight? That's pandemic. That's six years ago. That's long time Ago. Holy shit. That's six shit. Fucking years ago. He's not Coming back. If he did it, it wouldn't be Good. Yeah. At what point in time do you say Connor's never coming back, is it now? Now. Right now, yeah. You see him like, Dude, he's got more money than God. I, he loves the attention. So I mean he like the spotlight. But are you gonna go through a camp and go fight in the fucking cage just for attention? You have All the money in the world. What's going on with that left leg? Oh shit. It has to be Army Chris for again.


He did. You know? Yeah, He did. I mean, and I don't his career too late in his career. I Don't think anybody's ever come back from that injury. No. He looks healthy though. I mean, Connor, look, I mean he looks healthy. He just looks like he's out of his fucking mind. I'm just saying that that injury is really a strange, it's the Worst one. It's the worst. It's the worst. If anybody's ever come back and been the same though, I think Connor would fight if he wasn't giving the attention from BKFC and doing all that wild shit. If went away a PFL heavyweight that snapped his hin and came back and fought. Well, I think, but he did it when he was younger. Yeah, I've seen that before. It was in MMA. I seen it in kickboxing. It always just made me like, oh For worse. A little ever hesitant. Go kaki and Tyrone Spong, that one. Whoa. I'm gonna say yes.


'cause you want show. I don't. No, no, no. Tyrone. Tyrone Spong just hit him right below the knee and it just snapped like a twig. Just like Chris dude. That's just like Anderson. I remember Longo telling me, he goes, man, Oh look at Sean's nose. Oh my goodness. Longo was telling me that he was, Chris was killing the pads that day on the back before they went out. He's like, he was legs. He's a hard kick, Chris. Yeah, well the sound that made Snap dude, My friend, my friend was at, my friend was at fucking LAX and a woman with her husband stepped off and a a fucking giant. My fucking truck. One of those black Uber acts Escalade ran over her foot right now, watch it.


Got she. She was a little heavy, so it hit her and she went like that. And it got her. So my buddy, strong guy picked her up and he goes, Brian, I go and he goes, her foot came off. I what? He goes, her foot came off. I go, whatcha are talking about? So she fainted in his arms and her foot was there ground. So he picked on the Ground her fucking foot up? Yes. Oh my God. Ripped off my, and he, he said, oh my God. He put it in Her lap. He goes And he goes, he goes, you're gonna be okay. You're gonna be talking to her. The whole time the guy turned out to be really wealthy in my front of the body. He, they took him to the hospital and all that and I guess they saved her foot. Apparently they saved Her foot. They sewed it back on, I guess. Oh my God. It's like Little, because he kept in touch with him and he said her foot, he, they, I guess they saved her foot. Can't be normal. What happened to that guy to get his foot? Foot Came off off the nerves.


Lorena Bob Cut. She didn't use her foot a lot. What Happened to that? That guy ever get his dick going and found it. That guy started doing porn. I heard Frankie Ween or something. Right. They Sewed it back on. But that is the fucking craziest thing. Imagine that'd Stick field skin would be hanging off. He, because her foot fell off. Foot was off. She had, she had a long dress on. I guess She was a Big girl. Yeah, big. She had Big girl. But Her foot fucking came off. Oh my God. It was, it was like it was on the ground. Hold on. Is Dean Thomas wearing makeup? No. They just had a close up On, they put a little bit on you look at Gilbert. Yeah. He looks like a Yeah, it is Gilbert. They always force you to wear that makeup. I don't wear shit. They always try to get me With the powder. They don't want you to be oily. That's why Like, so what I know to me it was always so offensive to wear makeup while dudes whole faces are hanging off.


Yeah. That's wild. You know, imagine, imagine if you're stepping in there and I Rainy Alna. Remember that fight? Oh, when? In the sphere. Oh my god. Where it was like a hatchet wound. Imagine if I had makeup on and I was interviewing her. Yeah. You wanna even touch me? That was the crazy thing. She looked, I've never seen a head like that. I rainy al Donna. No, no. You're Thinking you wanna, Yeah. I've never seen crazy. I felt bitch she was trying to cover it with a towel and stuff. Joe's like, nah, you look fine. She's such a great home mom. Oh shit. In her prime. She was a monster. Oh My god. She was a monster. That fucking division man. That 115 pound women's division. Woo. There's some banger fights in that division. Unbeliev. Unbelievable. Maybe the best division in the sport for women. Yeah. You know, in terms of like wild fights.


Not a lot. Not a lot. Fight much competes with that. That's And what made you bring a feeling Davis, by the way? You just watched that The other day? Yeah, well my friend Jake was talking to me about it and then I watched it. He said, dude, she just ran over and Mackenzie dur. I was like, really? Yeah. I'm like, that's impressive. And then I watched it last night on YouTube. Oh Jiu-Jitsu's good. I had it down. She did a seminar at my place too. How about that hip toss too? Oh, it was Beautiful. Oh my god. She has judo background, right? She started ju That's what it is. Yeah. She has a judo background too. But yeah. And, and she's, you know, I think Mackenzie's so good in Jiujitsu that she thinks she could not thinks, but she's good at squirming at stuff and everything. But woo. Yeah, she had that. Fuck, she locked her up tight And that top pressure was nasty. Yeah. Ooh. So technical.


So good. She's Got a very good juujitsu, That girl. Yeah, it's like juujitsu like as just a sport as you know. Like you look at the highest of highest level guys right now. It's so exciting. And, and now that like CGI like Craig Jones Invitationals giving out a million bucks. Twins are unbeliev. Yeah. Oh my God, they're so good. Fuck. That's one thing I really like about one fc. You know, they had all those just straight up grappling matches. Like Mikey, remember Mikey Atch tapped that dude's rip that dude's knee apart. He wouldn't tap shit I've ever seen. Remember that? Dude? That's nasty. Nasty. He just kept ripping it apart And you know, his knee's gone. You gotta, it's gone and he won't tap and it's just rip crap pop. And Mikey was like, it was disgusting. Like, why'd you make me do that to you?


Now Mikey signed with the U Ffc, right? Yep. Did not for fighting, for No, for just for fight pass fight. Pass those Fight pass invitationals. Which is great that they're doing that. It's great. His, His guard is the craziest thing I've ever seen in my life. Mikey's Good. I've never seen it like that. It's So funny man. There's so many tournaments now more than ever. But I still enjoy watching it used in MMA more than anything. Juujitsu. Yeah. Oh fuck it. Yeah. Oh yeah. That's what I love. I mean at Damien Meyer versus Ben Ashkin fight. Oh My god. Jake Shields versus Damian, You know, one of the biggest travesties of all time. What was that when they took Damian Maya off of Oman's back. Oh, a hundred percent. A hundred percent. Oh They separated all that. That arm was just stopping him from taking a full and and he can't hold that forever.


He can't hold that forever. They separated that separat. Oh, I just think about that. It Was infuriating. He could have been a champion because They didn't know what he had. He had Kamar Oman, he had that left hook over the top early on the fight dry. And he's basically taking his back and Kama iss in deep water working. And Kamas only loss up until that point was his first fight. Rear naked choke fuck. And it was climbing in the round and everything. And It's Damien Maya. Yeah. Who was like one of the greatest stranglers of all time. He's gonna strangle you. He would've got greatest. He's on your back. It's gonna happen. He was one of the greatest stranglers of all time. Yeah. I mean, just phenomenal Juujitsu, His fight for Ben Asra was fun. 'cause it was both, it was almost like a throwback where one guy's using more because standing up, they both kind of nu they both didn't do too much, but one guy's using gro sweeps, Uma plotter reversals, pure juujitsu.


And then you got Ben as using all his, he's doing the big take downs. So it was, it was just such a great fight style, verse style type fight, You know, great Fight. It gives you An idea, it gives you a, an an appreciation for how good Gordon Ryan is. Like all these amazing guys And he's so like, what are the big fights that are coming up next? Like what do we got Alex? So we don't know what's gonna happen right now. I hope. As crazy as it sounds, I hope Ilia goes up to 55. I really do. To fight Bofski Diego Lopez. 45. I'll take that. Ilia goes up to 55. Fuck. I don't care if he only defended title one time or didn't agree. Who cares? You want Ilia to fight Mock Jeff? Let's go. Let fucking go Faced a couple of those guys first, like you just said.


Yeah, be nice, but also, who cares? Let's go. Let's fucking go. I have a mock. That's if you wanna make the big fight for July, you wanna make that big fight in July. Is it the Vul Kovski rematch? I don't know. I think Kinski people wanna probably see him win one or he gets KD by Islam in the first fight. He gets KD by Islam in the second fight. Yeah, I don't see him fight to period either. You want see him, you wanna see him fight, You know. Well he gets, excuse me, he gets beaten by Islam in the first fight. He gets Ed in the second fight and then he gets Ed by Ilya. So two koko losses in a row in one decision. Kind of as, even though he is a legend, you kind of wanna see him beat a contender. Get a win. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe. And Dio, I mean, Lopez.


Well, I I wouldn't hate a rematch. No, I wouldn't hate a rematch. It's not, It's like must see tv. No one's asking for It. It's one of those ones where I hope Alex is a hundred percent and I want to see it. He should be, he shouldn't have fought him back quickly after getting Caleb by Islam. Terrible idea. Three months, four months later he took a shot. And so you took a shot. So if you wanna Do a big July card, you would do, you could do that Ache. Hamza versus Dus. Hamza. DDP, John Jones. And as that the Greatest card of all time be so sick, that'd be the greatest card of all time. Fuck you imagine Alex D is dude, two guys go up. DRAs goes up. Ilia goes up. Drake is versus But then again, look, an golia is tough man.


Tough shit. That ain't a gi No, that ain't a gimme. That's a tough fight. Super tough. I mean, uncle LE's wrestling is gonna be a problem for Alex, But here's, he's not really a Wrestler. He's not really a wrestler. He's more of a striker. He's a striker. And he, he said he is gonna knock him out standing. He's got what he says until he feels that Fucking, oh, look at that one ten one ten. Even fight Dan Hooker. Justin Cage. He's gonna be wild. That is gonna be wild. Ooh, What is this with Dais is March? Yeah. Yes. March. Lemme see what else is on that card. Oh my goodness. Maurizio Roofie and King Greenie's bro. Roof. He's nasty. Connor. That guy's good. Roofie is nasty. He, he's fucking good, man. That's a great fight.


That's a great fucking fight. Nice. I like it. And That's another one that just falls short. Is that Alex Moreno. He's fucking good man. He's fucking good. He's, sometimes he gets a couple of stumbles, but another guy that's, he reminds me of Matthews a little bit where he is. Got the really good standup and he, and he's got, I like his Juujitsu a lot too. Some good fight nights. Caner and Rodriguez. That's a good fight. Oh my God. I Bro Soto and Sonya. Don is a tough fight for Souto. Sonya. Don is fucking dangerous, man. I thought so. Without tapes. Fun. So I thought Soto retired. When is that? He was, but he can't. He wants to come back. He can't. Wild. He Gotta get back February 22nd. That's that fucking juice. Oh that is? That is real. Soon Weeks. Brendan Allen. Ooh, that's A good card.


That cheap silver is nasty too. Yes. Don Cruz is out. He retired. Yeah, he's, yeah, he ripped his shoulder apart. Poor Curtis Blades. Oh, that sucks. With Dominic. He always had some problems with Health is Getting out. Ar Boss Is still fighting. Still fighting. Yeah man, he's fucking still good too. This is crazy. God, how about Ricky Simone?
