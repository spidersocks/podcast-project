You're like, what? Oh, I can see the double meaning on that. I'll, I'll put on. I meant that. Oh yeah, definitely. Well that's the difference between like writing it and saying it.


Right. You write it and you're like, I think I know how to go with this. And then you get on stage and say it and you're like, oh, that's the funny part. Yeah. Yeah. This is, this is fucking ridiculous. The fact that this exists is ridiculous. Yeah. I'm always embarrassed if I wrote something then say it and it's not even close. How the fuck was that thinking?

This episode is brought to you by Montana Knife Company makers of the best, most sought after knives out there. The company was founded by my friend Josh Smith. He's been making knives since he was 11 years old and became a master bladesmith at just 19, which is wild 'cause there's only about 140 to 150 Master Bladesmiths in the world. Plus these knives are made right here in the USA, right in Montana. And they're designed, tested, and built by hunters. For hunters. I've been loving the Magna Cut Blackfoot 2.0. When Master Bladesmith, my friend Josh Smith, launched Montana Knife Company. He set out to create the ultimate do it all knife, small and light enough to pack on a goat hunt durable enough to completely field dress a moose and shape a gut cape, skin and de-bone with ease. He called this flagship knife the Blackfoot, And it remains his go-to blade. And I love it as well. It's truly the only hunting knife you'll ever need. Although MKC is still a young company, the demand is already crazy. Literally every time they drop a batch, they sell out in minutes. So if you want to be the first to know, sign up for SMS alerts for exclusive knife drops and their email newsletter to get notified about Restocks.

I watched Tibble killed a rabbit in the yard and I heard it screaming. So I like went out to be like, I pulled him off the rabbit. Oh man. And when I lifted It was funny. He was all muscle. I was holding him under his chest and he was just whoa. Like he could feel him, feel him breathed. Then I put him back in the house and as soon as I put him down, he fucking scratched me and walked away. Whoa. He was mad at you. It was crazy. Wow. He was mad at you. He ruined His fun piece of shit. Yeah. This is what I live for. For real. Wow. Bro. You Can do that revenge thing. I got called Gay by my cat. Did I tell you when my dog, my dog got honey dick by a coyote and tricked into breaking into the chicken coop. Yes. Honey dick. What? Huh? Yeah, this, this coyote became his friend.


He was this big mastiff and the coyo, the coyotes knew they couldn't eat him 'cause he was huge. So they became friends with him. Mm. So he thought they were dogs. And so the coyote hopped the fence is like, Hey, you know, there's a chicken in there and we can get in there. Oh. And he is like, I can get in there. Okay. So he fucking tears open the chicken coop. 'cause he could at any time he wanted to. The coyote grabs it and the coyote hopped over the fence. I watched the coyote hopped over a six foot rot iron fence. Like it was nothing. That's awesome. He leaped up in the air, touched the top of the fence with his feet, and then put his back feet on and hopped over with a chicken in his mouth. It's Like a Mexican. Wow. I was like, I am under, you Saw it taking the chicken? No, I just saw the chick. We were playing time. I was playing a board game with my family in the living room.


And one of my kids out, one of my kids yelled out, it's a coyote. And then you see this fucking coyote run across the backyard with a chicken in his mouth. Just get to that fucking fence and leap it like it flew. Like it was like gravity. It wasn't real. Were you like impressed or were you mad? Super impressed. Yeah. Well it's like that. You can't be mad. I was mad. I wanted to kill it. But it's like that's, that's what they do. Yeah. And that was impressive. But That's all you, that chicken's cost is worth you saying that. Oh, a hundred percent. Percent. Yeah. A hundred percent. But then Johnny realized that there's this whole, that was like one chicken was brooding and when a chicken's brooding, you have to separate them from the other chickens.


'cause they won't lay eggs and they pick all their feathers out. They think they're gonna make a baby with this unfertilized egg. So they would just wanna sit on top of the egg. Oh. They don't wanna go around it. It's a weird psychological thing. The way to break 'em of it. You take 'em and you put 'em in a little tiny pen by themselves where they have to stand on a post. So then they, they can't nest. Right. And then they do it for a few days and they're like, oh, I'm over it. And then they go back to being a regular chicken. They're not the smartest things in the world. Sure. But this, so this one was in this little tiny one. But then Johnny Cash realized I could just go through this wall. 'cause he was a 140 pound mastiff. He was huge. So he just tore the chicken wire, opened himself and killed nine chickens before I got to him.


Holy shit. Yeah. That was a couple days later. But the, the coyotes had talked to him and convinced him like, chicken eating is fun. October 7th. Seventh, you're good in not eating these chickens. Look how pig you are. You can eat the chickens. Good point. It tricked him into doing it, man. I, he had never done that before. And then he's hanging out with this coyote. And the coyote is like his homie. Damn. Honey Dum. Honey dum. What's that? What's that Term? They probably sent a female coyote and just like, Ooh. Oh, the Mormons do smells like Pussy. He Doesn't, the Mormons out in Salt Lake. They sent other cute ones to try to convert you. Try to get you in. I heard it works. That would work on me In a second.

But You can drink energy drinks. Did you know that? Really? No. My friend was a Mormon. He was down in these fucking giant monsters. I was like, bro, that is way more caffeine. Yeah.

We all know Americans are still recovering from years of surging prices. Now, some in Congress wanna make cuts to Medicaid. A program that provides critical healthcare to 72 million struggling Americans, including veterans, people with disabilities, kids and your friends and neighbors. 40% of American births are covered by Medicaid. And Medicaid covers healthcare costs for a third of children with cancer. Working families rely on this program. It has 77% support. Nearly nine in 10 Americans oppose Medicaid cuts. Did you know that 12 million Medicaid families live in rural communities? Many of these people voted for President Trump, but they didn't vote for this. If Congress cuts Medicaid, a lot of rural hospitals could close and a lot of rural families will be hurt. No matter how you look at it. Cutting Medicaid just doesn't make sense. Tell Congress not to cut Medicaid. Our health and our communities to depend on it. Paid for by the coalition to strengthen America's healthcare.

I was always said that he was the most under appreciated two superstar during the Conne McGregor times. Oh yeah. I was like, you guys are missing out. Like you got Conor McGregor. But Nate Diaz just beat him and said, I'm not surprised motherfucker. Yeah. Not just like, I can't believe it. It wasn't storm the field guy. I'm not surprised. Motherfucker. The fuck's it choke. That was what got me. That's what got me into the sport. What about this? I was at that one with Epstein.

What are you talking about? These have to clear. Sues reported $9 million. Wow. So they robbed him out of 9 million bucks. Pre-fight, deal in place, promoter, blah, blah, blah. Yeah. So he beat him, but he he's owed $9 million. I hope he gets his money. Me too. Damn. Yeah. Also, he's doing that. Right? It's hard to get a money on a person who doesn't have any money though. That's impossible. That's the problem. You get an old Ferrari. Yeah. You can have his stuff. Nate. Nate does. They do like juujitsu shit. They'll do like seminars. Yeah. Yeah. He does a lot of stuff all the time. Makes plenty of money doing seminars. Then Nate's a legit jujitsu black belt Belt. He's a black belt purple. They belt always say purple. Right. What he'd always like as he was doing this, he'd be like, I'm much just a purple belt.


Right. Like, shut off dude. Yeah, He was. They were. And his brother. It was one of the best of all time. That was always cool him. 'cause anytime I've hung out with Nate, I've never hung out with Nick. But they always, he talks about Nick with this reverence. There was a time, there was a Time, I've never seen anything like it. People missed it because most of it happened in the strike Force days. And you know Nick, it was a small Yeah. Nick's prime. Nick's Prime. He was a bad motherfucker dude. He was a terrifying guy. 'cause he had the most insane cardio that's ever existed. He's, this guy swam from Alcatraz to the shore. He swam what? Five times? What? Five? I said twice. And he corrected me online. I said five times since then, he's probably swam a bunch more.


So he's probably like 10 times now. He's still 11. Shit. Yeah. Swim from Alcatraz in the ocean with the sharks. The thing that was supposed to keep people from ever escaping that island, people voluntarily do it. And he's done it a ton of times. Trained by that. His fucking cardio was off the charts and you just couldn't keep his pace. He'd put a pace on you and hit you with like 50% punches. Yeah. 50% punches. But constantly having your face. Why? Talking shit. We gonna do, bitch, what you gonna do, bitch? Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. And then every now and then rip one to the body, rip one to the body, pop, pop, pop. And you're exhausted. And you can't breathe because when someone's punching you, you can't take a breath. So even if he's only punching you like this, you're, You're all tense.


He's relaxed. Wow. He's a better boxer than you. He's better at Juujitsu. Whatcha gonna do? Take him down like whatcha gonna do? And That's, yeah, I Know. How did he ever lose when he lost? It got to a point where later in his career, St. Pierre early Though, everybody slows down. But in Strikeforce he was in his prime. Like one Frank Shamrock. Yeah. Nick Diaz versus Frank Shamrock. In, in Strikeforce. A great example. Whoa. That's A fight. He beat Shaara. Ooh. He beat his ass. But When he lost in his prime, why? How did he lose? Well, he didn't really lose in his prime. Well he, he might've lost a couple of decisions in his prime in Like three rounders. I'd have to like go back and look at it. But like, he submitted Gome, which is like this huge thing in pride with a go-go Plotta.


Like off of his back while he was high, he tested, he tested positive. So he was tested so positive after the fight that like he had to be fighting high. Damn. Yeah. And just, he'd be like, yeah, Fuck yeah. Fight high. Let's go. Bitch. That New Rock movie looks fun. Oh yeah. Oh, the Smashing machine. I haven't seen it. He's not gay, But yeah. But the trailer is amazing. Jamie bring up Michigan. Walking onto the field versus Ohio State. Oh shit. He won't do it. Won. He has the left. He won. How would Say that? We Won. We're living high right now. We don't need to Win. Go back. Did you win Michigan? No, he won the national championship. What's is we Shit, There's a lot of, we shit, A lot of we shit going on dude.


We fucking dude it. Yeah. Me and Nate almost beat Leon man. When I slapped him, it was crazy. We got the belt. The bitch slaps. That was the other thing. Who'd hit you with bitch slaps? It's crazy. I mean, I never thought about the 'cause his punches were like, I didn't know they were 50% like that. Oh yeah. It's like you just can't breathe Full. He'd tire himself out. Exactly. For sure. So He is putting a pace on you that you can't keep up with. Yeah. And he's not hitting you at full blast. Like Nick would throw kicks like for fun. They were silly kicks. Like they didn't, they were never gonna hit you. He would throw, like, he would pretend to throw like a wheel kick or throw a high kick. He wasn't even trying to hit you. He was just trying to put something in your face, put something in your face, and then let you know that he's so relaxed in there with you.


He'll throw silly kicks at you. Yeah. And just beat you up. I might go to that New Orleans fight. I think Poirier is fighting again. Yes. Poirier is gonna fight. Max Holloway. Right. Ooh, That's a hot one. Ooh, That's nice. That's the last fight of his career, right? Uhoh That's in Po. New Orleans maybe. Exactly. Holloway's a Poer. Well, Poirier going.

Little fuck. I know. An airplane. He was ready. He Had that geared up. No, I knew he coming in. But until you It looks like a movie. It looks like a Movie. What? I sent Jamie yesterday. You you wanna get mad? Yeah. Let's get mad. Let's get mad. Oh, the LA Fire Fund. You know they had this big fundraiser show.


Big fundraiser. They raised a hundred million dollars Contributed to What it all be. Wait Till you find out where the money went. It is. It's James Lee did a thing about it on Instagram. No. Yeah. And there's been articles written about it where people are like, where's the money? Uhoh This the way they distribute the money is so crazy. You, you're gonna, you're gonna read this and you're never gonna wanna donate to charity again. 'cause you find out what charities are really, what a lot of these like non non-profits are really about. The lady running the charity that got the money makes almost a million dollars a year. Bbl m me too. Yep. This a bunch. Same lady. They're all, it's all No, But it's all, everyone's like, well, lemme get a taste. Same fucking lady Killing. Listen, listen to this to, I looked into it a little bit.


We'll watch it. But I would, what they say though is that within the first month, they distributed half of that money. Hold On before you press play on this. Don't trust folks to distribute. That guy with a fishing hat is not a reliable source. My number one source of news. Getting and then he's trying to, he's he's trying to blame the Annenberg Foundation. That is one of the richest fucking families in California. They have, they're worth so much fucking money. And it shit wonder How they got money. I mean, fire, It doesn't, doesn't matter. It's like liberal ass. Jamie. I'm fucking they paying liberal ass fucking how much? Just play the video. How about play the video and let everybody figure it out for themselves? Let's platform this guy. Okay. Yeah. Play it. Liberal Jesus Hunter Might be one of the biggest scams in disaster fundraising history.


And as usual, I'm bringing the receipts. First off, according to reports, the fire aid benefit concerts raised over a hundred million dollars supposedly for LA fire victims. Cool. But since then, residents have been asking where did all the money go? A hundred million dollars raised for residents, community things and funds that are supposed to help with politics. And there's no Accounting. He played football. Hmm. Let's figure this out. Guy was, So according to the fire aid website, it says that all direct donations will be distributed under the advisement of the Annenberg Foundation. According to the IRS nine 90 form. The Annenberg Foundation Con is a 5 0 1 C3 based in Concha, Pennsylvania.


I Live there. Conci baby. This lovely Office building. One massive red flag. I know that building that only 33% of their annual expenses goes towards actual charity programs. The rest goes to administrative costs like executive compensation. Oh, if you look at the numbers, they treat you pretty good over there. Starting with top dogs. Cynthia Kenard, who's making three quarters of a million dollars plus another six figures in bonuses. She started the Fire basically almost seven figures just for one person there. Here is Cynthia, AKA sin hanging out with Gavin Newsom. Pretty discussing or strategizing about Like how to solve Wood. Wood. Both of them. Six be, yeah.


Anyway, just to give you a point of comparison with another nonprofit, doctors Without Borders, they spend almost 90% of their money on actual programs versus less than 1% on administrative costs. Local journalists have also been asking where's the money? They found quote, the fire aid website names only three Palisades organizations that receive grants among almost 120 organizations listed as receiving Couple Jew ones. Keep going. You can see who got couple Jew ones in. Hold on, lemme read it. Why'd you stop? Because he is focused on the Palisades. I just Play 20 organizations. We'll talk later. More specific to Pacific Palisades. What? To Israel. And Those three are Ka Israel Haba of Pacific Palisades and Palisades Charter High School.


Listen, Scorpions thing was tried to Directly reach out to The Annenberg Foundation. They were kind of given the run around various extension numbers. Somebody saying they would call them back. No one called back Customer Service. Also referring to some mysterious man named Philip. No last name. He was never found. This is just crazy. So essentially what they're doing is taking the a hundred million dollars, then paying themselves roughly 70% of it. Wow. And the rest of the money, they're dishing out to various other nonprofits with their own administrative expenses. And that's how a hundred million dollars just ends up disappearing. A Yay. Wow. Benefit. I'll believe it. Maybe he's selling the truth.


Maybe he's exaggerating. But the very least 30%, This is the NL, the cancer research. 70% ghost administration. 30% goes to the actual cause. These nonprofits. That's crazy. Yeah, that's, Yeah. They're for their own profit. That's crazy. And well, It's just a loophole. Loophole too. Loophole. It's a loophole. They found a loophole to make a great living by being virtuous. And then they see a fire and they're like, sick. We're all getting raises. Well all we're saying, Jamie, is that this guy is saying that 70% traditionally goes to administrative costs. 30% goes to the actual problem. Right. That's for all charities. But if, but if. Right. That is for all charities. For a lot of charities, but not Doctors Without Borders. Which is one of the things that he brought up. He Just picked one though.


Right. But he, he was comparing you with this stuff to, he's like, I'll pick a charity. And this, he picked probably one of the worst ones. You know, we've gone over the charity stuff many times. There's, there's good and bad Charities. Right. There's good and bad charities. But the point is that this a hundred million dollars you're saying, was distributed to a bunch of different places. Not just Pacific Palisades. Looking into it to a hundred million was a number that got used in advertising to make everything look big and look good. Probably. I was my part. I was trying to say too, assuming that it is a hundred million, there's a bunch of companies and a bunch of like artists that said, I'm gonna pledge a million, I'm gonna pledge a million. And they never, and you have to go collect it all. You don't know if they all send it in. Oh, you know how many times I've pledged Stuff? I pledged a million dollars to not Dame's. NIL. I haven't done one single game. Did you do it by Yourself?


Were you in your apartment? No, I was at the fucking championship game watching Ohio State win. And I was going, not Dame needs a DT tackle, I'm gonna give 'em a million bucks. For real? Yeah. And then they were like, Hey, you wanna give us that million bucks? I was like, no. A pledge Is that Legally binding? It was a pledge jamo. Well that's, isn't that the weirdest thing about colleges? Like how much money colleges get in donations from people that are like really wealthy that used to go there? Yeah. Yeah. I didn't even go there. Didn't go. There's a big thing with college. I just wanted to win before my dad die. Yeah. That's why these college kids are getting money now. It's kind of crazy. I talked to one at Barsol in Chicago, he's played at Indiana Center and it's like, how much per year? He goes 300 grand to transfer to Indiana.


Oh that's Whoa. For a year. Notre Dame, pat Cogan. What? He transferred to Indiana? Yeah. He, he was from Notre Dame. And it's just like, that's a good living. I don't have to go into this for my life. I'm gonna take my degree and like actually start A life. They should be doing that for those kids forever. A hundred percent. They're making money off of 'em forever. They're sold out stadium. The only negative is you can't have a player for four straight years. Yeah. There just needs to be regulation on it. Yeah. Because this now that now they're letting 'em pay players. So now it's just the fucking wild west. They gotta, they gotta make Wild West. They need to do that shit for the Olympics. Gotta make, make it, make four year pledge. Even then it's Olympics. The big schools are all gonna the get all the best players. Olympics, they don't get nothing. The Olympics, they get rich. Zero. Everybody else gets rich. You beat up by a man That can happen.
