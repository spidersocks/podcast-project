I'm so happy to be here, buddy. Thanks for, I'm happy to have you here. I I, I was excited to see you. We know each other a long time, and and I, I was excited to come to Austin. Of course. We were just talking about how zookeeper was 14 years ago. That's shocking. Like, How, how I, I know. I hate that. Fucking flies by, man. It's terrible. It's terrible. It's, that was a fun time though, that Oh, yeah.


KJ was so excited that It was very fun. That was very fun. I, yeah. I, you and KJ was Sussy. Yeah. Right. That's how you guys, that's Oh, you guys. I've known Kevin for 30 something years. Yeah. I've known him forever. It's funny because even your standup, my watch you standup the other night. You guys remind me of each other. There's something, something, you, you take your time on stage. You set it up, you say your shit and you live in it. Like you, I, it, it's, it's, it's, it's not the same, but that you guys, you can tell you guys are buddies. It's something about it. That's, that's, you feel like a, everybody feels like I fucking, I would hang out with that guy. That's cool. But, but did you and KJ start standup together or How'd that Well, we didn't start together exactly.


I started in Boston. He started in New York, but I met him when I was like, I guess two years in, about two years in where? Where'd you guys meet? In New York. At the Strip or something? I think we met at East Side. East Side. I don't think I did. That's downtown. No, east Side Comedy Club was on Long Island. Oh, Oh, oh. Yeah. That I used to go there. That was in like hunting, tennis Huntington. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Great club. That was a great club. I, that was Richie Mannie's place. That's Right. That's Manni. But now that's a funny bastard. Yeah, he's a funny dude. I, I first, one of the first comedy clubs I watched, I think I saw Carol LeFer at the East Side Comedy Club. My sister lived in Huntington, and, and she said, do you wanna go see?


It wasn't my first, but it was like first couple. And she said, do you wanna see a comedian? There's a club around here. I said, yeah, yeah. And I sat in the back. I, I think it, I think I might have been like 15 or something. 16. Wow. And I. And I. Saw a Carol Leaf or Kill for like an hour. I think that was exciting that that club was rocking. Yeah. It's gone though, right? Are there good clubs along the island now? Like what's That? Oh, geez, man. I don't know what's happening. There was always governors. Governors great. That always existed. Yes. I remember there was a few bars that were comedy clubs that I used to do there. I just don't remember the names right now. But back in the day when I was young, I would go out to the Island Governors.


I don't think I got on there much. Maybe a couple times when I was young. That was kind of a rocking club. Oh, yeah. Steve O wasn't Steve. Do you remember Steve O Steve? No. He was a, I know Steve o the, You know Jack Ascot? you know Jack as No. There was another guy, Steve O who was a funny comic. And John Mulrooney. You remember Mulrooney? Sure. Yeah. I remember. He was kind of huge out there. He used to be a cop, right? I think so. Yeah. I think so. He was, I remember Mulroney was, by far, him and Kevin Meany were the two guys you didn't want to go after. I remember Mulroney would just destroy a room. He was so loose and would dominate the room, and then they'd bring you up and you're like, oh, goodness gracious.


I saw Kevin Meany once at Catch Rising Star in, in Cambridge, and it was insanity. It was when he was at his peak, absolute peak. I wasn't even thinking about doing comedy then. I was just a comedy fan. Right. And I went with a friend of mine from high school. I think we were both like 18, and we went and we saw him just fucking destroy for an hour. To the point where I, I got outta there. It was like I had an ab workout. I was in pain. Yes, yes, yes. I was like, Jesus Christ. Yes, I know. He Was so, he was so in the groove. Like everything he did was funny. I I, man, and I've never in my life killed his hardest. Kevin and Mey I mean there's nobody who can kill that.


I remember me and Rock would be on the side at Catcher Rising Star watching me know Meanie, do whatever he did, and he would just like, yeah, I don't think I can get laughs that loud. It fucking blew out the room. Every time he was on fire. He was on fire. But it was, it was weird. It's like, it didn't sustain. Like he, later in his career, for whatever reason, it just, the whatever he had for those few years, like in the eighties and the early nineties, it didn't keep going. For some stranger reason, he kept doing standup, but something was missing. Right. I don don't know what it was. Did he, He, he, I know he killed on The Tonight Show with Carson.


I'm, I'm sure he might destroy and did all I, I don't know what he wanted. I don't know what, what the next thing he wanted. I just remember maybe, didn't he do a TV show, uncle Buck? Yeah. But that was not that good. Right. you know, that was the John Candy movie. That's that they turned into a television show. Yeah. And I. I think, you know, there was always the thing that he was in the closet, and then he came outta the closet. And then it was kind of like right before he died. I'll tell you, I di I, I did a Boston Club comedy connection when I was 17. I ate it. I came off stage. I mean I bombed. And my dad was there watching. It was a terrible feeling. And, and even the mc, who, I don't remember when I came off stage after eating it, I'm walking, you know that awful feeling of walking through the crowd and they're looking at you like, Jesus, dude.


And, and then the fucking mc stopped me. He goes, Adam, Adam And, I. Turn around. you know, your head's spinning and shit. I go, you know, I look at the guy, he goes, class clown And, I. Go. I nod my head like, yes. He goes, maybe stick with that place. P laughing. There I go. Okay. you know, I fucking walked off. And then I went into the dressing room 'cause I was wanted to hide and meanie, meanie, you funny kid, blah, blah, blah. I said some nice shit to me. I always remembered, oh, that me fucking good dude. Man. He, he was lifting me up. Yeah. Some encouragement from a, a real comedian, when you're just starting out can go a long Way. Yeah, man. Because it's so, in the beginning, it's so shaky. You don't know if it's gonna work out.


Like, what am I doing? Oh, you feel, you go home at night, head spinning. What Am I doing to myself? Why am I doing this? Yes. Yes. It's fucking insane. It truly is the sickest feeling. Ugh. And then there's the days or nights you go on stage and your shit's, you're not doing good. The cr you're eating it, but you have a confidence and you're like, I'm pretty good at this, even though I'm fucking eating it. Right. I, I feel pretty good right now. You feel like this is, I'm gonna figure this out. Right. Right. Exactly. Yeah. I'm gonna figure it out. Yeah. Your movies kept my family sane through the beginning of the pandemic. That's, we, we went on an Adam Sandler run where like, we watched basically every, we, the only one we didn't watch is Little Nikki.


We didn't, For whatever reason, we never got to that one. 'cause we, we watched other ones like two, or I watched The Zohan. I might have just seen the Zohan 20 times. Wow. I fucking love That movie. Thank you. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. Such a funny movie. Why didn't you ever do a second one That's fucking always talked about it? I mean, dude, the, the, It's a no brainer. It would, it'd be a little tough sell now. Right Now, we'd have to wait a minute. Put that one on the shelf for a little bit. Yeah. We had to put that one on the shelf a bunch of times when we were about to do it. 'cause shit would go on. We'd be like, maybe it's a tough time to do it right now. And then we just, we got it. We did it. We, we, the intention was good to try to say, let's try to get some peace out there.


But, and then another part of it is I'll never fucking be in that shape again. Mm. I can, I don't think I could ever do that. And then you Can hire a trainer. Get a trainer. I know, but I can't stick with it, buddy. You are doing great. How the fuck are you eating so good? And hitting it so hard? I, I'm like, you know, I used to fucking take working out so serious when I was in maybe up to like 25, 26. Yeah. And now I can't fucking do it. I, I play hoop then I eat And, I. Every, even while, every time I'm eating, I'm going, what are you doing, man? You don't need to do this. I can't stop. Just have a little bit of thickness all over. Yeah. It's something that just, you, you have to stay on the horse.


You can't back off at all if you back, especially as you get older. Yeah. Yeah. You back off at all. You just start, what is this? You start feeling this thing. Oh, I know. I have a new, what's this? Know buddy. Well, you fucking walking now. And. I. Go. Jesus. That'd be fun to look like that. I always fucking wanted to be. I had, I had no shit when I was 18 to 23. I hit it so hard. I never looked like you, I never was Jack, but I was, you looked good during the zhan. Pretty Good. Really good. Pretty Fucking good for me. Yeah. That was, that was as good as I can get. And I. Ha. I naturally had a little something going on when I was real, like the, the college years. But that now it's fucking rough. My kids go, why my daughter, one daughter, Sadie's always saying, dad, get the trainer from the Zhan.


Why would you ever give that up? Why would you want, why did you stop? I was like, ah, it's a lot of work. Yeah. But didn't you like the way you felt? Yeah. Well, you should do that. Get that feeling back and stuff like that. but I just can't jump in there. Well, She sounds like a good coach. She's good. Yeah. She's, she's The right shift. Saying the right. Saying the right stuff. She's right. Everything she says. She's, I, I, I have a, a thought where I, I, it's, I don't promise her. I go, let me think about that. That's a good idea. The whole thing is just not overdo it in the beginning. Start and slow where it's maintainable and then slowly build up. That's the key. So you give yourself new goals? What, when, when? Well, I never stop, but I mean when you get started.


Yeah. And the be the thing is like, people try to go too hard. Like, oh my God, I'm outta shape. I'm gonna run fucking 10 miles and I'm gonna lift weights. And, I'm do Yeah. Then you're too tired. Yeah. And then you're so fucking sore in the morning. Like, I can't keep this up. Yeah. Yeah. The whole key is just give your body enough where it's, it's pushing it, but it's not exhausted. You're not breaking your body down. Right. You're just strengthening it slowly. That's good. You gotta get sick the same way. Or you gotta get better. The same way you got sick. Right. You got sick over time. Yeah. Over time, eating food. Right. Yeah. That's good. Fucking up. Yeah. And then you gotta get better that way. Over time. Slowly start to morph your body back into a good condition.


That's Good. I like that. Everybody tries to go too hard. They try to go too crazy. They do get sustainable. You get excited to get it going again. And then, and then you Get injured. You break yourself down. Yes. You hurt your knees or hurt your back. It's like, it's too much Tear or something. Yeah. The key is just not do too much. Just do enough and just cut back on. You say, I'm gonna only have two cheat days a week. Two days a week, I'm gonna eat whatever the fuck I want that five days a week I'm gonna eat clean and then break it down to six days a week. I'm gonna eat clean. Wow. And one day a week I'm gonna fuck off. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. If you could go one day a week, just fucking off. Yeah. You can get a lot done. That's amazing. Yeah. The fuck off day is from start to finish. You can do whatever you want. do what You want. Fuck you want. One day. That's, and then the other days, the, the good days.


What, what do you like? Do you eat a breakfast and all that shit? Yeah, Sure. Yeah. Yeah. I, I skipped breakfast lately. That's my new move. The last year is Like intermittent fasting. I guess so. But I'm supposed to fucking, you know, lock in on eight hours or six hours. And. I always say I do one to nine, say, then around fucking 10, I go, let me have some grapes. And then I go, I think I'm not supposed to have grapes. And, I go, ah, a few grapes. And then it opens up to some other Shit. Grapes aren't the problem. The grapes lead to some bad Shit. The grapes lead leave D waffles. Fucking skinny cow. This, that's the new thing. Skinny cow. Ice cream sandwiches in the house started a little problem for me.


What are skinny cow? They're supposed to be a little better for you. 'cause the calories aren't awful. I think it's like one 30. So I go one 30. Usually they're fucking like three 30. So then I eat two, two of 'em. I go, it's still under that three 30. Then I go, if I have a third, it's still in the threes. So I eat a third and then I fucking go. I gotta Stop, man. Yeah. If you want, you really wanna be serious about taking, just hire somebody. You got money. I got the best guy, the guy who did me for the Zhan. And he's, I love him. It's just, I see him And, I love him so much that I go, let's keep this a friendship. Let's keep, I don't want, I play so much basketball though.


That keeps me, okay. It doesn't want me to take my don don't wanna take my shirt off. but I don't. How often Do you play? Maybe four or five a week. Where I, I get out there and run. That's great. That's Pretty good. That's very good. That's good. That's very, that's a key. If you could do something that you really enjoy doing. Yes. you know? Yes. If you something that keeps you active, that you enjoy that, that makes it so much easier. 'cause you're playing a game, so you're getting fit for sure. But you're in the middle of a game that you Really like. You don't, you don't hate that at all. That is the best. I think that's the only thing I got that you, you, you, you fight that. That's fucking fun. Right? Martial Arts are fun. Yeah. Martial Arts are fun. K KJ always fought.


I never even thought one time, kj, we left a hotel. And, I think he just came from fighting with one of the guys who were teaching him some shit. And he was so riled up from it. He put me in some fucking crazy hold all outta nowhere. We were walking, we were going to dinner. All of a sudden he came at me. I was like, holy shit. And he fucking grabbed me, twisted me around. Had me in some weird hold. And I said, oh, okay. He's just letting me know he can destroy me. But, but I remember just going, yeah. That's, that's fucking something I should get into, man. but I just can't, I'm not flexible at all. You, you're very flexible. Yeah. That helps. Well, I started stretching before I hit puberty. That's the big thing. Or during puberty. Really?


So it's like, while your body's thickening, you know, you're, you're keeping stretch, stretching, keeping loose. That buddy, that makes a giant difference. I never, I, by the way, KJ would, being in flexible is very odd. He can put the hands on. Yeah. He's fucking weirdly, He's a very athletic guy. He just, he just eats like a fucking army. He does get excited. He, I sometimes, when we were young, I'd say, tell me your McDonald's order. And he'd be like, okay. Three quarter pounder, three Big Mac, whatever the fuck it was. Oh. He goes hard. It was his McDonald order is Insane. Goes Kevin go hard. But he, like, he also, when he was on a podcast, tell me fasted once for how many days did he fast for? Yes. 60 something or Yeah.


Some insane amount of days. It was like 40 days or something crazy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maniac Something insane. And then I think he ate a, a sandwich and it really hurt. Hurt. I'm sure you're stomach much, probably like, what the fuck is going on? Oh My God. He's a madman with that fasting. Yeah. Well, he's a, he's an intense dude, you know? Yes. He just an intense with eating too. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But if you ever watch him hit the mitts, ever, ever watch him hit pads. Yes. He can fucking strike. Yes. I know. It's, It's kind of shocking. Yes. People that don't know him. Yes. You see him crack mitts and you're like, Jesus Christ. Holy shit. He is. Yeah. He's fucking legit. And he and he can roll around good too. Oh yeah. When he was getting ready for Here comes the boom. Yeah. Like, you know, when he was training with Mark de Lata, God damn dude, he was cracking those SI know, I know.


He did let me know in that one thing he did to me. you know who did that to me too? Farley Farley. We were in the hallway on, on at Saturday Night Live outta nowhere. Oh no. We were at a fucking hotel. And he came at me real fast. Put me, grabbed me, put me in some shit, pulled hard And I. Felt every part of my body crack. And then, then Farley laughed. And just like with Kevin, they kind of looked at you like, I could fuck you up if I, if I wanted To. Farley was a big dude too. He was a big boy. He was like maybe 5 8, 5 9. But He was like five, eight wide too. He was wide. Yeah. Fucking athlete though. Moved nice. Well, When he moved around on stage. Yes. Yes. you know, when he moved around on SNL, he was fucking, that was part of the thing is he was so explosive.


Oh yeah, man. Like part of the funny in him was this fucking insane. Yes. He, he had this explosion inside of him that could get out. I only met him once. You Did meet him? Yeah. I met him on the set of news radio and he was Oh yeah. In the middle, the throes of addiction. So he was ah, he was gray. Like wet cardboard. Ah, yeah. It was weird. It was weird being around him. He just looked sweaty. He was like, Hey, how you doing? I was like, Hey, what's up? Was he there to see Phil or he was There to see Andy Dick. Him and Andy Dick were hanging out. And I. Think they were both off the rails. They Were having fun. Yeah. They were having a good time. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Fucking that sucks. I hate it. Well, he was, yeah. It's horrible. But He, that was a good time of life though, huh?


That news radio shit. Oh yeah. That was a lot of fun. It Was Spade and, and, and, and Phil and No Spade wasn't on that, spade was on that other show. Just shoot me. He was on, just Shoot. but I thought he did a couple of couple of Things. He think he did. Yeah, he definitely did. But you know, a lot of people did, you know. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of people did. Was That your first episode? Big thing To lock into? That was the first big thing. I did a small sitcom that nobody watched before that called Hardball. Hardball. What, what was it about? It was a baseball show on Fox. Yeah. I think I remember last Like five or six episodes. What were you on that? I was a baseball player. Oh, that crazy. Did you play Baseball? I did. In high school. Oh yeah. A little bit until I started doing martial arts. And I about all sports.


Gotcha. Gotcha. That's cool, man. I want me to tell you, my martial arts, it's not that big of a deal, but I grew up in Manchester, New Hampshire. And a lot of guys were tough, you know, fought and shit. Fights would happen. And then I had the idea, I drove by downtown, I saw this guy, I can't remember his name. M something, And. I. Fucking saw a kickbox. And I was like, lemme take kickboxing just in case I could fuck somebody up. 'cause I, that'd be fun to have that secret weapon of kickboxing and you know, all of a sudden be able to kick someone in the face. That'd be great. And so I talked my buddy into it, or maybe he talked me into it. but I think that, anyways, we both go and fucking like 15 guys in there from school all, all already doing it already.


Advance And, I was like, all this did was make me realize these guys can kick the shit outta me. I thought guys I could take, I was going, oh fuck, that guy can crush me too. I had no idea. but I would. I, I'm never flexible. So I, I just, I think I quit after like four or five sessions. Flexibility is something that everybody can gain. It's just you just to go through the process. Flexibility is not something like, you know, there's like certain amount of explosiveness and athleticism that some people just don't possess. And it, it take a long time to get there. But flexibility is something that you just have to work at. I I, I've seen very inflexible people become flexible. Yeah. Yeah. What, what? Just by doing it every day. Doing it every day and just sticking to a routine.


You just gotta force yourself past the pain. you Know? I'm just nervous. It's, my hamstrings are gonna pop. They're so fucking tight. You know, it's just, you get, you ever see one of those things where you, it's like a, a strap and you, you put your foot into it. Yes. You like, pull back. Like, Those things are great. Yeah, I know. I know. I just Take a yoga class. Yeah, I know. I know. Go to Hot yoga. That's a cheat code. No, that's a good one. It gets real hot in there. Yes. And you get a lot looser. Yeah. That's good. That's good. No, my, my wife's good at that shit. The whole, my whole, my daughters do it. I just fucking, it hurts my lower back and my hamstring so much that I end up just going. All right. I get up and do a fake water break and just stare at him.


So how was working on this special? I saw you in Vegas. I saw you stare. I did. In, it was very funny, man. Thank you buddy. Very funny. I really enjoyed it. I appreciate it, man. I, I, I had had a great time making this special. I had a great, I have a great time on the road. I can't believe it. you know, I fucking quit doing standup for, you know, like 20 years or something. What Made you want to get back? I think I was doing grownups and Rock and Spade and Schneider and KJ were always talking about next weekend I'm going to Niagara Falls. And I'd be like, these guys are all fucking having fun on the road. And And I, And, I. And then I think Apatow was doing a Carnegie Hall.


He was hosting something and he said, you wanna do some standup again? And I. Just go, yeah, yeah. Let me do that. And I. I did it just to make sure that I fucking put together 15 minutes or something. That got me back into it. And did you just piece it together by doing small sets? Or did you, how did you write out? Was I don know? I was, I was, I, I think maybe I did a couple of improvs or something that maybe, maybe I went to the improv a couple times. But mostly from doing Letterman. I used to do Letterman and do two segments.


So I'd fucking sit down with my buddies, write jokes, and just go out there with jokes and kind of trusted that. Yeah. That's a good joke. And I. Think I started doing that with standup too. Just going, ah, this is pretty good. Lemme just do it. And then like, when did you start booking gigs? Same shit. I called the guy, this, this, this great guy whose daughter was going to school with mine. He would talk about booking acts and shit. I said, I'm, I was thinking of doing standup again. You wanna book me some shows? And then he just booked like a 10 city tour for me. And I said, all right. I better fucking put an hour together for This. Wow. So how did you, what, how'd you put the hour together? Did you go to the improv? Improv? Did you Go the store?


Where'd you go? A couple times at the store. Improv. I would drive outta town, you know, the valley, maybe Hour. Like the haha, That kind of shit. Yes. Yes. Anybody Flappers. Exactly. Flappers. Flappers. Good spot. Good spot. Try shit out. Yeah. Yeah. I just did a bunch of, maybe I went down to that Comedy Magic Club. Is that still Rocky? Yes, I did. I did. Yes, for sure. Mimosa Beach. That's a great club. Yeah. Good. Yes, exactly. Except I remember growing up, I would always see Leno and Joe. What, what is it Joe? Not not, is it Brogan? What was it, what Was Jimmy Brogan? Jimmy Brogan. Yeah. The Booker. Yeah, The book. But he did Did stand up as well.


He did stand up and they were so clean and they would fucking annihilate And I always felt self-conscious. and that place for how Filthy I was. And I. Like, these people don't wanna see this. Well, the Comedy Magic Club is like the cleanest club in the country. That Right, right. Yeah. Yeah. I And Jimmy Miller used to book it. Did he? I think so. Okay. Yeah. Al used to always go there. Yeah. It's a, that's a great little club. That's A good club. So I've forced myself to get a good album. Now. I got I mean when I'm, when I was on the road, the last tour, I was, I have so many, you know, I have so much shit that steps on other shit. So I can't really do it. All right. 'cause if I already said this, so that this joke doesn't make any sense now.


So, but I was fucking doing two hour shows and it wasn't that big of a deal. Wow. Can you believe that? Yeah. I mean. 'cause I remember struggling to do an hour of my whole standup life. I'd be like, my God, how fucking the crowd's so bored with me Now I can't come up with new moves, you know? But now got enough shit. Keep 'em rocking. So How long have you been steady doing standup again now? I think like seven years. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. It must feel good though, right? It's nice, man to get back into like a real flow, like a real headline or flow again. A hundred percent yes. And go, oh yeah, I missed this. I Did miss it. I didn't even know I missed it. It's The most fun. Absolutely. You, you, you fucking were loose. That was, you set yourself up to, to do a live fucking special.


I don't think I could handle that, man. My head be spinning way too much, man. But you but I had to over prepare you. Yeah. Yeah. You, but you, you didn't have, you didn't have any pauses. You were just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. How long were you doing that set? Well, I did, well, you know, 'cause I have my own club that helps a lot. Right? So I was doing two shows a night, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. So I was doing six hours of standup a week. Which is a lot. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then I was doing podcasts and all the other UFC stuff that I do. So a lot of work. Right. That got to be too much. So then I knocked it down to three sets a week, three headliner sets a week. And then I would do a bunch of short sets.


you know that bottom in the barrel show that I told you that my friend Brian Simpson host, that show's the best. It's, it's like a premise factory. Yeah. Because you have this whiskey barrel on stage, it's filled with notes from the crowd. Yeah. It's all just different ridiculous ideas for premises. And you reach your hand in, you pull one out and it's just, you know, frogs are gay. Right. Like, whatever. It's, and you just start ranting right about, and you try to come up with bits and, you know, and you land you every now and then, and you land on good shit. One, you know, you get one or two every set that you write it down. You're like, this could be something that's Amazing. Yeah. And A couple of them made it onto the special. That's incredible. Because it's like they, it's a premise factory. Absolutely. So I had, I had a lot of, I was getting ready to do a special in, I was gonna do one in August of 2020.


But then, you know, obviously in March everything shut down. And I didn't do standup for eight months. Right. And it was just, and and then I thought about it, And I was like, you know what? I just feel like just working on my material now, I just feel like just working on standup, but not, not even thinking about the special. Yeah, Yeah. Yeah. That's a great Feeling. Well, it's just, I just wanted, I was just enjoying working at the club. Owning the club. And then there's so many good guys at the club. It was just such a fucking hot spot. Right. There's so many people there. Shane Killis and Mark Norman and Ari Shafi and fucking Brian Simpson and Tony Hinchcliffe. It's just like every night we just, just murderer's rope. Right? Yeah. Yeah. And we were all just cooking together. That's big. And then when Netflix said they wanna do a live special with me, at first I was like, fuck that.


I don't wanna do that. And I said, no. I told my manager, I was like, no. I called her on the phone. I was like, what? I don't wanna do that. Yeah. And then I was driving home. I'm like, why are you scared to do that? You fucking pussy. And I was like, as I was driving home, I was like thinking it. And then I, when I got home, I called her back. I go, don't say no yet. I go, lemme think About it. Wow. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've had that with feelings. Yeah. And then the next day I said, all right, I'm gonna do it. And she's like, you sure? I go, yeah, yeah. I'm gonna do it. 'cause I'm scared of it. That's Ballsy, man. I was fucking Terrified of it. Of Course. I, I, I, I, I'm, I'm scared thinking about doing it. I would, I would never fucking do it. But, but you killed it. You killed it. You were loose, you were rolling, you crushed. But I didn't that set in order for three weeks straight. Right. So I had it locked in.


Yes, yes. For three weeks. I didn't do any No d which I always fuck around. Yeah. But it was, there was no fucking around. Yeah, yeah. No deviation. That's right. That right. For three weeks. Right. You were, you were steady. Exactly. I also wrote all the bits out by hand. I wrote 'em all out. Even the ones I already knew. I wrote 'em all out. I wrote all the transitions out. I listened to records. I watched videos. That's big. Yeah. I beat myself into the ground. Yeah, that's good. Yeah. I over prepared. Right, Right, right. I've done that. So then when I got up there, there was no, what is next? What is next? There was no thought about You didn't have have a beat sheet somewhere, just in case you got lost. No, no, no, no, no. That's fucking balls. I would never be able to do that. but I wanted Cheat it, like a regular show. if I had a regular show, I wouldn't have a cheat sheet. Well, I fucking just, I never did when I was young.


But now I, I need fucking a word. I need to look somewhere and see the word. What do you like, put like index cards on the tape? On the stage? No, no. On a monitor. I Just look down and Go, you know, it says like, you know, just, just word popcorn and then I'm ready because my head goes to space. I get spacey as I got older. When I was young, I was prepared and blah, blah, blah, boom. Yeah. And I did my shit. And I think it helps me kind of relax a little bit, just knowing that if I'm lost and looked down and see a word and go, yeah, yeah, yeah. Do that next. Bill Maher brings like one of them conductors fucking things on stage where, you know, like they have like, yeah, right. Where you put the news, the music rather. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He has that and he just has his ideas written out on that.


It's good. So he could just look down at it. I get addicted to that a little too much sometimes. I, because, you know, Largo in la I go up there, the Flay runs that place, and he lets me go on and, and, and try shit out And. I have a music stand. And I fucking, I'll be at work All day working on movies. And then like 10 minutes left to go, I go, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me fucking And I got a couple guys in the office who help write jokes with me. And, I go, lemme try this, this and this. And I. Just put the sheet down, go on stage, try shit out. Try new shit out. Nothing better than a new joke. Yeah. It's very exciting. That's the best. If it's working. Usually does work too, because You're excited. Well, you're enthusiastic about it.


And if you really have thought about it and prepared for it, it's like a new thing for you. So it's this exciting new toy. Oh Yeah. Yes. Yes. And you can't wait to get to that or open with it or whatever the fuck It is. Yeah. When you do movies, do, do you just come up with a premise first? Like, when you decide to do a film, like if you decide to do Happy Gilmore, how do you, how do you like, make your movies? How do you start? That's I mean. That was just lucky premise. Billy Madison, I remember I thought, oh, this could be great. A guy who, a grown up who does elementary school again. And that's a great idea of being, I get to be goofy, get to bully these little kids, then all of a sudden connect with these kids and have fun growing up again.


So, but part of my head was like, well, Rodney did back to school already. So everyone's gonna say, I just ripped off back to school. Rodney went back to college. How the fuck do we kind of do it a step away from that? And I called my buddy Hurler, he who I went to college with. And he writes all the movies with me. Or, or he, he's, he's just a, he's just a great funny man. And I. I've written almost everything with him. And if he goes, Ooh, that's good. Then we usually go from there and, and we try to fill it out after that. Same thing with Happy Gilmore, wedding singer, Bobby Boucher, all that shit. We were just like, came up with a couple of lines of what we thought as a interesting idea and then see if we can fill it out.


It's so funny because your films get loved by the public and hated by critics. It's so hilarious. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, you are the lead. Like whatever the Rotten Tomatoes critic score is. Yes. Yes. For your films means zero. It means nothing. Right. It's only the audience is what counts. That's All we thought about. Yeah. Yeah. Because your films are all so fun and so silly, and so, in my opinion, so underappreciated. Thank you, Man. Because like, this is one of the things I thought about during Covid. It's like, we watched it every night. We That's cool. We watched like, every film that you made while everything was locked down. Amazing. I love that. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. And my fucking don don't know man.


We lucked out. We, we, we, we worked our asses off. Like, you're working your ass off now. Like, this is, this is took it very serious. But you Caught like a silly groove. Yes. Yes. And I. Don't think anybody else has that silly groove like you do. I like you caught that groove with so many movies, man. Yeah, Yeah, yeah. We d I mean, when IW first started, Jim Carrey was crushing Stiller. Mike Myers, a lot of, a lot of goofy movies were getting made. And I, certainly fucking love doing them. And I love being on set, making those kind of movies. I love fucking editing that shit. M making thinking about kids laughing.


I always loved that. Thinking of college kids throwing, you know, throwing a tape in, sitting down, watching together. We, we, that, that was on our mind when we did it. When you first started out, did you want to be a comic? Did you want to be a standup comic? Or did you always think that you wanted to do films? I think I wanted to get into the movies. I was fucking nuts, cocky as shit. In my own weird way. I think a big thing that happened to me was I told my friends in high school I was gonna be fucking big and I didn't. So you had to, I had to do it. I told the boys, I was like, gonna be fucking great. And then when I would check in with 'em, I remember being on Payphones calling after even eating it at Catch Rising Star.


I call 'em Fucking did good tonight, blah, blah. Yeah. I go, yeah. I said, what'd you say? I said, this Joe fucking killed. Meanwhile, I fucking ate it every Time. So you're faking it until you made it. I was Like, I, I but I, I dug a hole for myself. I'm doing great. Robin Williams said I was fantastic. Robin Williams. I remember one night saw me eat it. And I was just like, oh man, I ate it in front of Robin Williams. but I changed the story of like, yeah, he liked that shit. There's something that could be very valuable about being delusional and being young. Yes. Very delusional. So stupid. Man. I did this thing once. Do you know Owen Smith? Who the hell is that Hilarious, hilarious comedian in la But he had this, he's one of the best comics alive, but he spends a lot of time writing and doing shows.


I'm sure I know, Unfortunately. Which I think he should be headlining arenas. He was just at my club a few months back. I saw him. He's fuck. He's a monster. Gotcha. The point is, Owen had this show that he was doing for a while, where you'd find your oldest notebooks and sit down with him and go over your oldest jokes. And it was so bad. They were so, it was like a 1991 joke book, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I keep 'em all. Yeah. And I was going through and we were reading it. And I was like, it's so bad. Oh yeah. I had him like, built in heckler lines. Oh yeah. That I wrote that were terrible. And then this guy was saying this to me and that it's like, oh, oh, That's so funny. Man. if I had to go back there and like, give myself advice, I would say, you gotta quit.


You're terrible at this. Oh my God. Yes. Don't do this. What Are you doing, man? Yeah. Don't do this. You sound atrocious. You're you're not gonna make it. You don't have It. So same thing. Yeah. There's no way. but I Fucking thought I was fucking phenomenal. but I would look that at the crowd, not laughing, going, these fucking, these guys fucking nuts. They don't see how great this shit is. But when I, it's almost like I was with my fucking giant Afro and my father would be at the table and he'd be like, you need a haircut? I'd be like, what are you talking about, man? He'd be like, you think you look good? I'd be like, I look great. He'd be like, you don't, just so you know, you don't look great. Be like, you are, you are so off on that, dad. It's funny. Delusional thinking can sometimes Yes.


Carry you to the, like, once you develop some skill that delusional is like a little guardian that keeps you protected while you actually develop talent. And that goes away. 'cause I, I'm more nervous now. Well, I had that fucking fear as a comedian. My head would spin when, when I, I Colin Quinn, he had a, a club, the paper moon in the, in the city. It was the paper moon around when you, when you were growing up, it was like the Boston Comedy Club. Like a small place like that. I Think that that became Paper Moon became the Boston Oh, the same club. Yes. I think it was downstairs. Oh, that one. No shit. So fucking Colin liked me. He used to get me on stage.


I was going to college around there. And I, All day long would be practicing on the elevator in my dorm. I'd be go blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Saying the shit. Right. When Colin would bring me up, my fucking head would spin. I'd forget where I was not making any sense. I would say two jokes and then I'd be like, oh my God, I don't don don't know what's coming next. And I had that going for a while, but I still would go home at night and go, fuck it. I'm gonna be so fucking good at this. don don't know what it was. Psycho. Psycho. It's youthful delusion. Yeah. Yeah. And it's also, your central lobe is not fully formed yet. You don't even understand the world. You're just, you're a little meat puppet. Oh my God. Yeah. Yeah. But that's how you make it.


That's how you make it in kind of everything. Like you, you're delusional, you know? Yes, yes, yes. If you really believe in yourself, that counts for a lot up to a point. Because there's people that still believe in themselves. They've been doing open mics for 20 years. And you Right. Nobody's stepped in to say, Hey, this is never Right. Right, right. Gonna happen. Right. Yeah. Yeah. You have to have a spark. Yeah. Yeah. There's gotta be a little something in there. And then you could build that little something to something special. That's Right. That's right. Same thing in, in sports guys who Oh yeah. Keep going and keep trying out and keep doing something that, but some, some people break through it. It's, yeah. It's interesting, man. I de definitely had a, an amazing time as a young youngster.


I had a couple of people that I locked in with. We were buddies. We all had that same thing of like, I'm good. I'm good. Even though it wasn't that good yet. Yeah. Yeah. I came up with Greg Fitzsimmons. There you go. Greg And. I. Were, we're both like confused and wondering if we're ever gonna make it and just, you know, we do a lot of road gigs together. Yeah. And we were hoping, but the, the whole idea was only just to like, one day you'd be a professional. That was the goal. Not really have any kind of a career. Career, yes. But just like one day to make a living telling jokes. That was the dream. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Like you couldn't even, Ima like, almost I would see guys that were actual pros.


Yes. When I had a bunch of like day jobs doing construction. Oh, driving limos. Oh yeah. I did everything. Oh, gotcha. And so then I would do these nighttime gigs and I'd meet the real pros. Yes. The guys who just made a living doing comedy. I'm like, what must that be? Like? Yes. They saunter in at nine o'clock At night. Oh my God. Yeah. They've been playing golf All day, laughing. The Kevin Knoxes. Yeah. Man. And all those guys. Yeah. Yeah. And I would just like, they were like heroes. Like of course you're the, you actually made it A fucking bad Asses. Yeah. Outside of the system. Completely. Oh yeah. All you do is tell jokes. That's it. And people Love You and they come to see You. And the same jokes a lot of the guys, they were just like, that's my act. I ain't fucking Right in Boston. Yeah. They never did television. So those guys had Yeah.


Right, right. And people wanted to go see those same jokes again. That's right. Which is crazy. That's right. Yes, yes, yes. Like Steve Sweeney. Did you ever see Sweeney when he was in his prime Absolute best, biggest destruction too? Yeah. Yeah. Oh my god. Steve Sweeney in his prime would light up a room. Yeah. In a and with Boston Accent and Boston material. You couldn't follow him. No, No, no. He Was, he was a monster. I think he went on the very first night I went on Stitches. Sure. That was the first place my brother brought me to Stitches. He was going to bu he got me one of those five minute open mics. That's the first place I ever did too. Stitches. Yeah. Wow, man. Yeah. Yeah. How'd you do, Eh?


Yeah, I got a couple of chuckles. You did? It was like enough to where I was like maybe 21. 21. Yeah. Yeah. I was like, maybe. Right. Gimme something, man. The second time I got some laughs. That's incredible. Second time in I was like less, less nervous. Wow. And like, I had listened to my rec record. I had a little tape recorder that I brought with me. Did, yes. And I recorded It. Oh man. Yeah. So How about that humiliation of the silence on the record? Oh, it's terrible. Yeah. But it also made me realize like, what was wrong, like, you know, just because I was studying it, like kind of the way I study martial arts. Like if you, you would watch films of fights and then I would, you know, go, oh, there was a little bit of a timing problem there. And I could have done this.


I could have done that. Yes. And so with my second time, I did stand up, I had the, the humiliation of listening to the first cassette. Yeah. So I listened. And I was like, lemme tighten this up and maybe this could be a little better. Oh my God. Tightening it up. Right. A little more there. but I got some laughs the second time, which was like crazy. I was like, wow, I might be able to do this Shit. Man. Both had stitches. Yeah. And then I think I bombed the third time, and that was the first real bomb. And I was like, Ooh. Punch in the face. Fucking scary. Yes. Yes. But every time I bombed, I feel like it taught me something. And And I would get better. Fucking, I ate it last year, last summer. I went up to the comic strip and fucking ate it for 10 straight minutes.


And I went, oh shit. I forgot about that. Forgot about that punch in the face. That is a roughy. I ran into you at the airport. Yes. And you were telling me you just did some fucking horrific corporate event. I ate it there too. Oh, that was I mean. if I listened to the tape, I'd say you were okay. But Oh, it, it's humiliating. Yeah. I, you had just gotten done with it when I ran into You. That's so I was shells shocked. I remember seeing you and your wife. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I had that fucking glazed look. Those corporate gigs are So Ron White just ate it at one recently. He goes, I don't Know why the fuck I agree to do that. I know. He goes, they just came. And I said no. And they said, more And I said No.


And then they came up with a number. I was like, all Right. Holy shit, buddy. Yeah. Same fucking story for me. Those are deaf. I'll, I don't think I, Those things are deaf because the people that are there, yeah. They're working with all these people. So they're all like, kind of tight. Yeah. They got shit going on. Yeah. Yeah. And they're not really thinking about the comedy show. They're thinking about This is like a social environment with all the people. They're working their way up the corporate ladder, and they're concentrating on all their shit. And they're also, they can't laugh at anything inappropriate. That's True. Yeah. I saw Mike over there laughing and all those sexist Jokes. Mike's a real piece of shit, You know? Yeah, that's true, man. That's good. I I, I swear to God, I felt bad for them.


I was like, Jesus, they paid me so much. I fucking feel terrified. I didn't kill for, but, but it happened. Yeah. Hinchcliffe just did one recently too. He said the same thing. I'm like, that's why don don't do those. They, it's not do comedy where people come to see comedy and that's it. I I don't get hired for a birthday party. Get the fuck outta here with that. It, it was a, the only fucking reason I did it was Paul McCartney did it the year before. So they go, well, they don't do this much. And, I went Paul McCarney. Well fuck, I'm doing that shit. Yeah. But Paul McCartney can just play his songs. I know, man. I, You know, and like, his songs are great. They're Classics. He's not gonna miss, He's not gonna miss, he's just gonna play the, and if they don't respond, that's on them.


Yeah. It's like, you know, you fucking nuts. You didn't, You just a ban on the run. The fuck is wrong with You people. I know, man. That's good. Yeah. you know, like musicians, they can always just get into their song. Oh, Shocking. They don't close their eyes. They don't need nothing. Yeah. They don't need you. They don't look around. Yeah. They Do. They don't need you. We're fucking looking out at everybody. That fucking dude's not loving it. God damnit I know we Rely so much on other people's response, But the moments, I don't, those are the ones I was saying to you, Joe And, I, I've, I've eaten it before, but still felt I did good because I fucking remained kind of confident. Right. And, and believe it in my shit still. But the ones where I look out, I see them hating me.


And, I go, yeah. Why am I here? Man, this is, that's a bad feeling. It's a terrible feeling. I say bombing on stage, like sucking a thousand dicks in front of your mother. Yeah. Yeah. The Problem is, it's probably worse than that because somewhere out there, that's probably a guy who wouldn't mind sucking a thousand dicks in front of his mom. you know? He'd be like, look at me, mom. We'll Give you bitch. You, You made me I 99. Let's go. My mother would 100% at the end say, you could have done it better. Yeah. You could have sucked him hard. Why did you stop on that one? Man? He wanted to explode in your face. And you, you stop. I feel bad. You should call him and tell him you'll suck his dick.


but I. Yeah. Yeah. I'm with you buddy. Yeah. Stand up. Standup's the best. It's a crazy thing. And then no one could teach you how to do it either. You have to figure it out yourself. 'cause your way of doing it's different than my way of doing it. My way is different than Kevin's way. Yeah. Kevin's way is different than fucking Seinfeld's way. Yes. Everybody's got a different way of doing it. Absolutely. And nobody can teach you how to do it. You can learn some things. Yes. From watching other people. You can learn some things from Oh man. Yeah. But how about when somebody fucking great watches you and says, Hey, you know what you could say here and gives you a great line. You're like, oh my God, Thank you. Yeah. No, that's huge. That what a feeling. You just made my okay thing into a fucking one I'm excited to do.


Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. There's been a couple of bits that I've had that got attacked from a friend that's just like, pops it up. Oh, it you're like, how did I ever do it without that fucking life? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Sometimes like a fresh eye. you know, that's one of the things that I always admired about how Chris Rock used to do it. Yeah. Because Chris Rock would go on stage. Yeah. He'd work his stuff out and then he'd have a bunch of guys that you would hire Yes. To sit in the back of the room Yeah. And kind of workshop with 'em. I Got, I do, I do similar stuff. Very smart. I have these young guys who are fucking way funnier at writing than me. And. I. Only 'cause I'm fucking tired. I'm tired. I walk into the office And. I'm like, I thought it this funny thing last night. Maybe something there. I'll say it to 'em and they'll go, oh yeah.


And they'll fucking write something interesting. And, and we come up with something together eventually. Well, you used to co collaborating when you do films, right? Yes. Yes. I always do that. Always got a bunch of guys that, that helped me out throughout the whole movie. Yeah. That's such a good process. Yes. Because, you know, one mind is great, but a bunch of minds together in different perspectives. People are gonna see things from an angle that you're not gonna see. Yes. That's exciting. Same shit. Same shit. Somebody comes up with a great thing to do in a scene or a line or a maybe you can be doing this at the same time. And actually, whatever the fuck it is, I mean me and the hur, he, when we write these things, we, we, we think a lot what it's gonna look like, what, what, what the, what's going on in these scene and what the jokes are, that kind of shit.


But on the day, you definitely having a couple of buddies around making it better is the way to go. Well, you always have a very tight ship too, like doing zookeeper with you and like, and, and talking with Kevin. Like you work with the same people pretty much. Yeah. Every film. Yeah. Yes. Which is really huge. Yeah, that's good because it's always, you have a very family environment, like always did. It's all family. Everybody's fun. They're all, everybody likes working together. Yeah. It's, no one's an asshole. Yeah. It's an easy, it's an easy gig in that sense that like, you know, you're gonna come to work with people walking comfortable. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. Everybody's having fun. Ke Kevin's Kevin got that going. You got that going. Yeah.


Yeah. You have to have that. That's gigantic. You Got, you got like a lot of great standup friends, right? Yeah. You, when you do the road, you, you just bring your, your guys with you. When you guys, like, how many of you go up on stage when you take gigs on the Road? if I do a gig, I bring usually one guy who's a beginner and then two guys who are headliners and, And and who, how much time does everybody do? It depends. Gotcha. Like this, when I did the live special, yes. I brought this kid, Ari Maddy, who's hilarious. Yeah. Ari did 10 minutes, well, he did 15 minutes the first night, but on the live night he did 10 minutes. So 10 minutes to warm the crowd up, and then he brings on Ron White. Ron White murdered. Yeah. For 15.


And then he brings on Tony, Tony murders for 15. Wow. And then I go on after that. So You're fucking tough to do that to yourself. Put on big, heavy hitters, because that can, that can get you in a hole sometimes too. People Crushing so hard. but I, as long as you're having fun, it doesn't 'cause the audience is having a good time. Yes. Though, my philosophy is, I, I don't want bad comedians going in front of me. I want people to kill Yes. So that when I go on stage, everyone's having a great time. Yes. They don't ever feel like, oh, they made that one guy for 20 minutes. Oh my God. When was he gonna get off stage? No, I know, I know. Because there's some comedians that like to do that. They like to bring in terrible acts, so they look like a hero. No, that's bad. That's bad. That's Bad. It's Bad for the audience. It's for your audience. Bad for your own brain. You just fucking, just, you're getting lazy doing it.


You're getting lazy. It's, it's a soft way to approach it. So like, when I do shows at the club, sometimes I'm going on stage an hour and a half into the show and it's like, yeah, same here, man. It's like Brian Simpson. Shane Gillis. Yeah. Yeah. Mark Norman. It's like killer after killer murder going up. Yeah. And then I'm going up late, so you gotta, it's like running with weights on. Like, you, you gotta like, come outta the gate hot. you know? I, I, Dude, I rem when I first came back to stand up, I was bringing all my buddies with me and they were killing. So it was good crowds. So everybody would stay up, you know, everyone's like, I know I was gonna do 15, let me do 25. And so by the time I got up there, I was following like six or seven guys murdering, and it was fucking two hours in.


And then I was supposed to do an hour and a half of that. I'd be like, shit, I gotta figure this out, man. I'm not ki I I mean. I'll Cut my That's too much. That's too much. You wear the audience out. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I feel like when a show gets over two hours, two and a half hours, it's like, I don't wanna see a three hour movie. No. No. you know, if, if I'm gonna watch a three hour movie, I'm gonna be at home. Okay. Yeah. Where I can pause. Yeah. if I have to take a leak, go eat, go have some popcorn. Yeah. Yeah. I wanna like, for three hours sitting in some auditorium somewhere watching a show. That's a Lot. It's Gotta be a banger of a show. Oh, man. Where you're so engaged when you walk out, you're like, Wow. How about that feeling? When you know, holy shit, that this arena, I've, I'm losing them for about five minutes.


Let me fucking get 'em, get 'em back. How about that? When you see people who started the show off with like Yeah. And then they're kind of like tuned out going, what is happening right now? Yeah. Why you talking? People only have a certain amount of attention span. Yeah. Yeah. you know, that's why I admire bands that still, like I saw Guns and Roses in Greece. Yeah. And They do three hours New shit. Or just No, all the classics. All the classics. you know? Welcome to the Jungle. Sweet Child of Mine. Can't fuck with them. Yeah. But they fucking go hard for three hours. Those guys are a hundred years old. They're fucking, they're still killing it. And He's singing three hours. Axel's ripping it for three hours, shit. Yes. Same with The Stones. I saw The Stones a couple years ago at Coda, the Circuit of the Americas here in town.


Yeah. And it was insane. Yeah. Mick Jagger's a thousand years old. Yeah. And moving still like a motherfucker. And He's fucking moving. Yeah. But no damn baby. Yeah. Yeah. He's still fucking dancing. Can't fuck with him. Yeah. All that energy. Yes. He breathes. It's funny, They do like Stones do two a week or something. Yeah. That's a really funny shit. 'cause when we go on the road, it's like five or six. That's the way to do it though, when you're 80. Yes, yes, yes. you Know you need recovery. Yes, yes, yes. And also, Mick Jagger works out every single day. He has two trailers Wow. Filled with gym equipment. Wow. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. Two of the trailers when they travel with the Stones is just Mick Jagger's gym equipment. What a fucking stud. A light little body. That guy looks like he weighs one 20 or some Shit.


Looks like one 20. Yeah. He's ripped still 80 years old. He got a six pack. Got The mani arms ready. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fucking ready to go. And still has his pipes. Still can sing. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. And Keith Richard could still play the coolest. It was incredible. Yeah. Watching them live was like, I couldn't even believe they were there. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It was one of those things where like, I was almost like, I was, I felt like I was on drugs. I was like, saw, am I really seeing the Rolling Stones are, they're actually there. Like, I could throw a rock. And I could hit Mick Jacker with a rock. My God. He's right there. My goodness. I know. And then how exciting, like when Keith and Ron look at each other and laugh. Yeah. They laugh together. Fuck. That Was incredible. They're still enjoying it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like, and when we were kids, there were no old rock stars.


Right? Yeah. Yeah. That's right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. They didn't, they didn't. Elvis like was right. Yeah. Yeah. You know, he died in the seventies. Right. So he was already dead. Wow, Man. Wow. And so, when we were kids, we thought of rock stars as like Van Halen, young, wild people on stage jumping around. That's a young man's game. Yeah. No one ever anticipated 80-year-old rock stars singing rock and roll in their eighties. No doubt. No doubt. By the way, I heard David Lee on your show. Yeah. He's been out a couple times. Man. I mean that band to me. When I was in high school, I think I was in ninth grade. The first time I fucking heard him, I was into Sabbath. My brother got me into Sabbath, and then I heard, I was walking up to a fucking party, was like one of my first house keg parties.


And Van Halen was blaring over somebody's pioneer system, and it was fucking like, ain't talking about love, but some shit. And. I. Remember just going, what? This is the greatest shit I've ever Heard. Oh, yeah. They were the kings in the eighties, dude. They were the kings when I was in high school. Yes. Everybody knew how to make that Van Halen logo. The V notebook. Yeah. Yeah. The notebook. It was either VH Queen, A ZDC Zeppelin, a d DC kiss. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. They were the kings. They were the kings. Yeah. But, you know, we never thought, like, we never thought they'd be still doing it. No, that's right. And, and then, then you'd see Van Halen the last few years live and you'd fucking be still as excited. Yeah. He still looks smooth as shit.


I saw with David Lee Roth maybe four or five years ago. He's, He's such a character man. Oh, yeah. you know, he doesn't have a phone. He doesn't have, he doesn't even keep money on him. I went to dinner with him and he has a lady that drops him off with me and is like, she's like his handler. And she says, I have her number, she has my number. She's like, call me if anything goes wrong. Alright. Right. you know, and, and just, you're hanging out with David Lee Roth having dinner with him. You know, I love, I love him talking about fighting with you and, and he, because you loved him throwing those crazy roundhouse kicks. Oh, yeah. He was a real martial artist. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. He used to train with Benny Es. That's Right. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.


Yeah. He's, he used to do those things on stage. We'd do like a jumping split kick in the middle of the air. Unbelievable. Yeah. Look at him. Yeah. He is a real athlete man. Yeah, Yeah. Absolutely. He is a stud fucking sweet dick on him right there. But they look at that, at that guy. Look at picture where he is. Got his pants hanging down. Yeah. Just, just enough. Show a little hippo. What Is that? Show some dick root, he's a character man still to this day. He's out to lunch, man. He'll Say, say some interesting shit. He's smart and knows his, knows his shit. Whatever he is into, he is, he's deep into it. That guy moved To Japan to train Kendo, which is a sword fighting art. Right, right, right. He said that just him and his dog.


Yeah. Lived in an apartment in Japan fucking for like years, Man. Just training kendo. I fucking, anytime you heard that they weren't getting along, you were just like, they what? Yeah. Fucking anything. You know how that goes though. Yeah. Oh. Anytime you would Four fucking people too much. Yeah. Shit. It's gonna go wrong. Yeah. Especially those egos and the bands. And then girlfriends don't like that guy. And then, you know. Right, Right. Yeah. That shit happens. Like, Valerie Tonelli apparently didn't get along with David Lee Roth and Oh, Okay. Yeah. That's gonna, that's gonna be painful. That's how it goes. That sucks. It's hard for bands to stick together.


you know? I think that's way Harder. I remember you too would always be in interviews, talk about how cool it is that they're still a rock band together. Yeah. The four of them loving each other. If you can get a band that enjoys each other's company, that's a fucking tremendous, tremendous asset. Yeah. Because so many bands, like I was just reading today, that Pete Townsend doesn't talk to the rest of the guys in the who. He doesn't talk to Roger Daltry. They don't talk to each other. Wow. Wow. Like how? That's funny, man. I just saw them. I just saw the, who had a, a benefit and they fuck and destroyed it was Daughtry's benefit. and that he, he brought the who on there, and I think the drummer was maybe Ringo's kid.


And, and if I rem or, or it's either Ringo's Kid or John Bonham's kid or, anyways, it was great. But Pete and Roger were funniest shit. Ragging on each other and saying Quick little insults. And it was like massive laughs like a comedian. But then they'd fucking have those hits that just take your whole body over. And it was great. Yeah. don don't know where they stand now or why they stand that way, but I was just reading an article this morning. Yeah. Oh yeah. That they don't talk to each other. It makes sense. They got a lot. Like, I remember hearing Sabbath on tour would fucking all show up in different planes. Mm. Like, I don't know if any of it's true, but you're like, fucking Tony Yoni and Ozzy don't fucking hang out the whole time.


Like, well, There's always a problem in the band where the lead singer becomes the number one guy and everybody else is kind of secondary, you Know? Yeah. Yeah. That's going to make you pissy For sure. The band's called Van Halen, but the main guy's, David Lee Roth. Right, right, right. That's the guy everybody wants. Ain't talking about love, Man. you know Badass. Yeah. Oh my God. Hot for teacher. He was the man. Yeah. And so, like, I could see how egos and feathers would get ruffled, and then the girlfriend on the side, like, you know, the band's named Van handle it. It's not name Lee Rol. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Definitely. Definitely. That's gonna happen. Fuck that guy. Fuck that guy. And you gotta stand behind it. He's Got all the groupies and Yeah, man. Well, but I, they had some, him and Eddie both had the different people who would talk about who's the greatest.


It'd be like David Lee Roth was just the smoothest and funniest and fucking Well, the greatest front men of all time. Fuck it For sure. He was like a standup. Yeah. Just dominated the crowd. Just like, I think there was some tape going around with, remember, remember some shit. Just like, that's okay, man, because after the show, I'm gonna fuck your girlfriend don. Don't know. Maybe that was David Lee Roth, somebody else. But as a kid you were like, oh my God. Fucking what? That was the coolest shit ever. But then I remember Eddie Van Halen when the, when Jump came out the video and seeing him smile and throw down that fucking lead. And he was just like, is that the coolest fuck on the planet with like, overall Hell yeah. No shirt over.


I went with a fucking no shirt, overalls move one time. Really didn't go over, didn't Get On stage, didn't get the respect. Not as a standup, but thought I was gonna get more respect. but I was on stage at a battle of the bands. I was, I used to sing and play guitar in a band. And I went my, my, I think my mom tie dyed my overalls and shit. And I was like, I'm gonna do it. I'm going. And I showed up and people making too much eye contact with me, not wanting to look down at the fucking overalls. Pathetic. It's a bold choice. It was A, it was one I couldn't make. Now one Of the funniest choices is what, what if you look back at like, the, the metal days.


Yeah. Like, you look, you look back at like all the guys who dressed up like gay bikers. Right, right, right. From Judas priest. Judas Priest. Yeah. It's Rob Halford. Yeah. Yeah. Tricked everybody. Yes. And dressed like a gay biker. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Because he was gay. I loved it. Yes. So he's like leather pants and the fucking leather biker helmet on. Sure. And the vest with no shirt on underneath. Yes. And all these guys started dressing like that. Of course. Yes. Yes. And they didn't even understand. Yeah. Yeah. That they had been tricked into dressing like a gay biker. Yeah. Yeah. I love that, man. That's great woman. I saw. So cool. I saw them at fucking Radio City with Iron Maiden. Really? That was a biggie. Wow. That was up in the balcony. Screaming. Screaming. I wanna a dress like you.


No, that was, it was good. Yeah. Look at him, man. Boy. Yeah. Yeah. I mean. Come on, dude. Fucking the Hellan. Yeah. They were nasty. They were nasty. That's a tough looking guy. Another thing coming. Look at him there with his fucking crazy outfits. Yeah. Yeah. It's just so funny. All the different styles of bands that existed. Oh man. I had fucking pleather pants. I wore fake leather pants for a bit. I, I didn't know my body wasn't great. So I was like, you throw that shit on you, you look like a rock star. Then I'd fucking see the pictures that my mom took of me after I looked at like, how the fuck did you let me out wearing that shit? It never fit just right.


I never had the body for, like, I would walk into a clothing store growing up. There was a place, you know, Sarah Silverman, the comedian. Sure. Yeah. I know Sarah. She's, she grew up in, in same town as me and her parents had a, a store called Junior Deb, I believe. And it was downtown. They sold Levi jeans and all this shit. And, I. Remember just going, okay, I'm gonna get some cool ass Levi's. Go to school, look like a badass. And I. Remember when I would see, when I saw a three-way mirror, I was like, these aren't fitting me like that. I thought, you know, they don't look, I don't look as cool in my Levis as I thought I was. You had an idea of your image.


I want, I wanted, I saw other people wearing that shit, going, all right, I'm gonna dress like that guy. But it didn't reflect the same when I had it on Again. Youthful delusion. Delusion. Yeah. Yeah. Did you wanna be in a band before you wanted to be a comic? Wanted that for Sure. What kind of music did you guys sing? We did a, a lot of Aerosmith, a lot of Van Halen, a lot of Sabbath Zeppelin. Aerosmith just canceled their tour. I know, I know. I guess Steven Tyler, you know, he had that neck injury where he, he fell and, and broke one of the bones in his neck. Yeah. Yeah. And apparently he just can't sing. He Can't open his mouth to sing the way. Well, they were planning on doing a thing with the Black Crows and Oh, wow.


Yeah. And they just, for whatever reason, you know, decided to put the tour out and get, get going. And then he started and he was like, I can't do it anymore. I'm done. That is painful, Man. Yeah. Because the guy's whole life was that. And by the way, fucking did you like Aerosmith growing up, Loved them. They were The, the bad boys that every tune was nasty. Oh yeah. That shit was the nastiest Push that microphone up to you, basically. Sorry, bro. No worries. And, and yeah, they, they, I loved my band. Played literally like 10 Aerosmith, who we'd always fucking play kind of cool ones. Not, not the massive hits, but the whatever the mama kings and the Walking the dog and Yeah.


Kind of cool shit like that. Well, We both grew up in New England and they were the kings. They they Were the kings of New Orleans. They were the kings. Yes. Yes. That was, they were the fucking band. WA af. Look at that. Yeah. A a f Fuck. Yeah. Yeah. Joe Perry. Yeah. BCN. Yeah. Yeah. B-C-N-A-A-F. What was the kind of alternative? Steven Tyler, He was the fucking man could hit every Fucking, now how about the fact that I read something that Yeah, he's a cool bastard. And I met him and they're all great guys. Joe Perry. He's a great guy too. Fucking Best. That's a New England accent too, on Joe Perry. Oh, yeah. It's funny to hear the boys talk. I think somebody lived in New Hampshire. Maybe Steven Tyler lived in New Hampshire. 'cause I, that's, that's where I grew up. And they, they definitely, they owned New Hampshire.


Well, they were the kings of Boston. Yeah. Like, they, they were fucking gigantic. Yeah. I remember the controversy when they did that duet. They did that song with run DMC when the did walk this Way. What the fuck? I know. Everybody's like, what's going on? That don't make no sense. I know. Meanwhile, that's a fucking great song. I was, Was my fucking Aerosmith came back. Yeah. Like they, they became the Kings again. Exactly. Yeah. That was their big comeback song. They're kind of faded for a while. Yeah. And then walked this way, came along and it's like, that was great. Young people started getting into 'em again. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. It's funny how bands like, they get, you know, like generational. Right. Even though they're great. Like, ah, that's the people that listened in the seventies.


Fuck those people. Yeah, yeah, yeah. you know, now we listen to this. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. And Then all it takes is one thing, and then people start going through the catalog. I'm Jesus Christ. Holy shit, these guys are Incredible. Same. I was doing, fuck, who the fuck was I listening? I, I play a lot of the old shit for my kids. And then all of a sudden you just go, wow. They had so many Bangers. Bangers. Yeah. Yeah. Especially the young drug taking days. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The Wild The Wild Aerospace Days. The first three, the first three albums kind of shit. Like Zeppelin too. Yeah. Oh, Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That I mean it's a different world. Yeah. Yeah. Every comic wants to be a rock star. And I think most rock stars wanna be comics. Yeah.


This, this, some of that too. Yeah. There's, there's something about the freedom of comedy that they appreciate. Yes. Yes. You don't have a band, you don't need anybody. All you need is a microphone. You don't have sound guys, you don't have anybody. Can you believe that? Yeah. Yeah. That's my biggest mistake is I, I fucking use music in my ax. So I gotta, I, my piano player, Dan Bula, he's the best. I love having him being together on the road, looking back, and we, we laugh together. That's the greatest part. But the, the back in the day when I just had a mic and didn't have to show up with shit. and that really is makes it Like, oh, it's amazing. Yeah. you know, when I would do these big places, like the TD Garden, like one of the things that would strike me is like, we're just showing up.


There's no trucks, there's no van. It's just a stage. Right. And me and three of my buddies, and that's it. Yeah. Yeah. And 16,000 people and, but bands play here and they have fucking trucks and Shit. I know. All these people have to break down the stage. They're there all the fucking pyrotechnics and all the crazy shit these guys have. Right, right. I know. I know. We we're cool. We're cool. We did good. It chose the right career For us. For us. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Until you watch a rock band, you go and that kick in our ass, man. It's definitely something different. Rock I mean Rock is kind of like a drug. There's something about going to see a band that's, that's really good. It's like you're, you're, the music hits your body.


Yeah. It overwhelms you. Yeah. Yeah. Like a drug. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. you know, you know the right tune. Yeah. Fucks you up. So I, I agree. Who, who was, who were like some of your first concerts as a kid? In Baltimore? First concert I saw was Jay Gilles Band. You did? Yeah. That's with Peter Wolf. And fucking that, that's as cool as a guess. Yeah. Back in the South Days, Aerosmith and Jay Gilles can Battle for the Kings. Oh Yeah. Man. Boston back then. Yeah. Jay Gilles was the fucking man when I was in high school. Yeah. Would see him. I saw George Thoroughgood. There you go. Johnny Winter. Yeah. I saw a bunch of bands. Where'd You see him in, in? I don't remember. I wish I could remember. I Used to, but then I got Worcester. Worcester. Sure. Worcester Coliseum.


Centrum. Yeah. Yeah. Is that what it was? The Rum? Yeah. I think so. Yeah. Then I got a job when I was 19. I worked at Great Woods. You did? Yeah. Yeah. Fuck And I played there. What a feeling that was. Yeah. 'cause we saw so many shows growing up. I Saw a lot of comics there too. When I, I, I saw some comics there when I got paid. Yeah. And then some comics there, I paid to see them. Right. Like, I saw Kennison there. I paid to see Kennison. It did. That's cool, man. Yeah. Wow. That was, that was, I saw Cosby there. I saw, wow. I saw Rodney there when I was working. There you go. Rodney was backstage naked with a bathrobe on. Yeah. Yeah. That's a big Rodney. That was the Rodney days where the bathrobe days. Okay, baby. Yeah. But yeah. Yeah. He would go on stage with a bathrobe just to make him feel comfortable.


Yeah, yeah. Yeah. He just was completely naked with a bathrobe on and just Murdering Oh, the best, the best. I Mean murder. And this was before I'd even thought about doing standup. I was 19. Fuck man. but I got to see, You saw Kennison. Was he Kenon? Always dressed badass. Yeah. Like a rock star. Yeah. Yeah. He fucking had the big long leather coat on and a beret and Yeah. I doubted that was just after I'd heard about Kennison too. Yeah. I had heard about Kennison from a girl that I was working with. I was working at, besides doing security guard work, I was working at the Boston Athletic Club in South Boston. Wow. Yeah. So I was a trainer that's still there, right? Yeah. I Think so. Yeah. I think they got a fucking basketball court there. Yeah. They got basketball.


Yeah. There was a lot of racketball there. Yeah. A lot of people. I met Bobby or there. You did. That's Cool. I had to help Bobby or, because Bobby or had had like fucking 150 knee surgeries, right? Yeah. His knees were destroyed. Yeah. And you'd have to help him get on the Versa Climber machine. Oh My goodness. Because Bobby's knees didn't bend. Right. Right. Bobby's knees bend it like this much. Right. Yeah. He had like 12 inches of movement in his, in his knees. And so you'd have to like, kind of help him get on the Versa Climber machine. Wow. I mean one of the greatest athletes of all time. You watch 'em play racquetball, love him and Love. You just kind of fall over. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 'cause it's, you know, back Then they put it all out there. Yeah. Yeah. Also, the knee surgeries back then were Archaic. Right. They were so primitive. Wow. Man. They just used staples and fucking screws.

That sucks, man. Man, what a hero. What a stud. Always loved him. He had 20 knee surgeries. Fucking insane. Was that your team? The Bruins? I didn't really watch sports. Oh yeah. You didn't? No. Once I got into martial arts, I really didn't care about any sports. That's pretty cool, man. That you, you didn't, 'cause I know that's, that's the biggest sport town. Oh, it was a huge sport town. Everybody called me a pussy. 'cause I didn't know anything about football, basketball, baseball. I didn't care. Yeah. I was like, that's pretty good that you had your own thought process going. I would join, join right in with trying to make the other kids like me dropping something.


Well, when I was 15, I just became obsessed with martial arts. That's great. And, I didn't care about anything else. I literally didn't care about anything else. I'd watch basketball. I'd be like, this is nonsense. Who cares if that ball goes in that hole? Fucking cool, man. That Doesn't mean anything to me. My dad always told me to do that shit. He'd be like, do martial arts, do martial arts, And, I. Like I said, I went to this guy's, like, I wish I knew his name. And I did that. And then I think I, a little early in life, I tried it out. but I, I just, my body man. I, I wasn't meant for it. It's not for everybody. No, That's good though. But that's like everything in life, things that are not for you. Yeah. You just gotta find the thing that is for you. Yeah. I found a few. And that's all I do.


Hoop comedy. That's it. Perfect. That's All I got For Happy Life. Yeah. I guess so. So This girl I used to work with, she was like a volleyball player and she was really hilarious. And she was, she was working at the front desk and she was like, oh my God, I saw this guy. This was 1986 is when Kinison had his HBO special. And she told me about it. She's like, there's this guy, and his name is Sam Kinison. And she, she was, she know that bit he did about homosexual necro. Necrophiliac. Yeah. Yeah. Paying money to spend a few hours undisturbed with the freshest male corpses. You remember that bit? I, I kind of, yeah. So she told me about this bit in the, we're hanging out in the parking lot of the Boston Athletic Club. Wow. And this girl is lying down on her stomach on the ground, and she's like, oh.


Oh. I Mean life keeps fucking in the ass. Even after you're dead. It never ends. And I was laughing so hard. Wow. Yeah. And I. Remember like, this girl, just her doing kinisons bit made me go to the video store to get a VHS of of Kinisons special. Right. Because the first time I saw it, it came out on video. Yeah. And then I watched it. I was like, oh my God. Yeah. and that was like the first seed in my head where I was like, okay, this is comedy too. Yeah. Yeah. Because I didn't know that was comedy. I thought comedy was like something I really liked, but it was so different than me. Yeah. It was nothing that I would ever do. Right. It was just different. It was like, I didn't see myself that way, but I saw that guy. I'm like, that guy's a fucking animal. Yeah. Yeah.


Was tough as shit. Yeah. This is a different kind of comedy. and that was like the first seeds in my head that I had of doing comedy. Yeah. That's amazing. And then I gotta see him live at, at Great Woods. but I saw Bon Jovi there. I saw, fuck. I saw everybody. I quit the night Neil Young was there and they had a riot. Really? Yeah. In New England, huh? Well, The, the, the, the lawn, you know how Mansfield Yeah. Great Woods has that lawn out there. Sure. Yeah. Well, it was cold out and people were starting fires on the lawn, and so they were like starting these little bonfires and, you know, we had to break up the fires. Wow. And then Brawl started breaking out. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. And I always knew that this job was like, you know, what need you get paid like 20 bucks an hour.


I'm not gonna fight somebody for 20 bucks an hour. This is crazy. So I always carried a, a hoodie with me. And so I had my security shirt. And then as soon as shit would go south, I put the hoodie on, like, I'm outta here. And that did, I'm with you guys. And I did that night. I quit. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I quit the night. That's funny, man. Yeah. Fuck. Yeah. 20 bucks to getting a full on brawl. Let's, yeah. There was brawls breaking out left and right. Yes. The first night I was there. Yeah. I watched one of the security guys beat this guy with a, a walkie-talkie. And I was like, Jesus, what did I sign up for? Yeah. It was a crazy job. So, because some guy had stole one of the golf carts and there was this dude named Ali Kat, who was the head of security there. And Ali Kat tackled this guy and he's beating him in the head, the walkie talkie.


Wow. Man. And I was like, whoa, okay. What did I sign up for? Did you, did you get in fights after you learned your shit? Like, no. No. That's cool. No, No. I avoided them all. That's amazing. I'm not interested. Infighting. I would like fights where they were planned. you know, Like meeting a guy in No, you mean in a Fucking No, like tournaments and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. That's cool. Kickboxing matches. I did a lot of those. But those to me made sense. Like, fighting on the street, it's like, no. Like people have guns, people have knives. That's right. This is fucking stupid. Sure. I was always nervous. Yeah. Like, I'm not, I never felt like you get in a fight with someone and someone hits you in the back of the head with a bat also. Yeah. If you fight someone.


Yeah. It's, that's never the end. Like they're gonna go get their cousins. Yeah. They're gonna get their brother. They're gonna try to find you when you're alone. Like, that's true. You don't want that kind of problem in your life. Just move on. Oh, it's such so easy to just take, take whatever they're throwing at you with like, that's supposed to start the fight. Just being going. Yeah. Okay. That, that makes sense. You're right. I am a piece of shit. I'm gonna get, I better get outta here now. Well, it all means nothing. Someone says it only means something to you if you believe them. Yes. Yes. you know, if someone says you're a pussy, you're like, okay. Like, what does that mean? This doesn't mean anything. You're just saying words until you try to hit me. This is nonsense. It's like, oh, you have a bad opinion of me. Oh, that's okay.


Like, I don't really care like that. And also, I was tired all the time. 'cause I was training like six, seven days a week. Wow. So I was like, I don't want to be involved in this stupid shit. Right. Yeah. And I already worked out today. I can't fight you. Also, I was very aware of the consequences of violence. I'd seen by the time I was 21 years old, I'd probably seen 40 or 50 people get knocked unconscious. Right. At least. What a terrible sight then. Probably a Lot more than that. I'd seen so many people snore. you know, it's just on the ground twitching and snoring. That's terrible. I've seen so much of that. Yeah. Yeah. I grew up with that. So it's like, to me, I was like, I don't want none of that in my life. I don't wanna have anything to do with this. Especially outside of fighting.


Yeah. Concrete floors and shit. Head hitting the ground. Yeah. Oh yeah. KJ worked with a guy in Long Island when KJ was a bouncer. Right. And this guy killed a guy. He, he punched a guy and the guy fell, hit his head and died. Yeah. Yeah. Now the guy has to go to jail. Now you, you're working as a bouncer. Just like I was working as a body or as a, a security guard in great woods. Like, you could have got in a fight, hit someone. Now you're in jail. Yeah. And you're like, for what? Holy shit. Yeah. That's, that's so cool. You worked at Great Woods though. That's like the, what a destination to go to and see so many great fucking bands. And I. I, you know, it's funny you said Kinison. I used to be on MTV when I was young and we'd go to Daytona Beach and You, you were on remote control, right?


I was on remote control. That's right. Quinn. Quinn got me on there. Yeah. And, and that was the best. But we went to spring break to Daytona Beach and Kinison was at the height. And I went to, it was the first guy I saw at an arena. Kinison and, and some other bad boys. So some guys, I forget their names, but they all Probably Carl Lebo. Yeah, yeah. Carl Lebo. Right. And a couple other guys. They all kind of really funny. Tough ba The Outlaws of comedy That call the, that's it, that's that's what it was. Yeah. And I saw Kenton Destroy. and that it was, it was like, I saw Rodney at a theater in Florida where it felt like fucking holy shit.


This is a rock show. 'cause it was bam, bam, ba crowd. Raw nuts. Rodney Rapid Fire. Like a machine gun. Yes. The best Rodney would crush for like eight minutes and then go, I know A lot of fucking jokes, baby. And they'd go, ha, you know, that was so cool, man. But Kinison too just took over you. I saw him in the moment. It was, it was amazing. Yeah. I got to see Kinison decline too. I got to see the decline. 'cause I saw him a couple of times live. And the last time I saw him live, it was in New Hampshire and there was not that many people there. I, I drove to this theater with this girl that I was dating. I was probably 20 at the time. Again, it was before I did comedy.


And he was just, it was already like boozing heavy. Yeah. Yeah. And it wasn't as good, you know? Right. He was a little, Because he peaked in 86. Okay. I feel like The Kinison from 86 was probably one of the greatest comedians that ever lived, if not the best. He was a monster. He was a monster. Yeah. But the guy was doing blow and drinking and hanging out with rock stars and just partying. And he, his brother wrote about it. Did you ever read his brother's book? Uhuh Brother Sam. Right, right. His about it. His brother Bill. It's a great book. Yeah. It's a great book. If you're a fan of standup, I tell anybody, go buy that book. 'cause it's a great book. And Bill said that you could see the drop off in Sam's material because he just stopped writing.


Right. He wasn't hungry anymore. Right, right, right. He had made it instead, you know, 'cause there's this like, there's this hunger inside of him to make it as a comedian. Yeah. And that's what led him to be outrageous. Yeah. Do all those jokes about like the starving kids in Africa and all these different jokes he did that were just so outrageous and that preacher's voice and that fucking powerful delivery. Yeah. But then when he made it, man, it got real fat and just, just drinking every night. Yeah. He was, he was started wearing the bandana slower. Right. The bandana days, the rockstar days. Sure, sure. It just dropped off. It wasn't the same. It was like a caricature of kinison. That's funny. Yeah. It's just happens. It happens that when you're drinking or doing whatever the fuck it was, I, I got coke.


Yeah, sure. I think that's the, that's the one that really like People. Well, that makes you not think straight. You are definitely all over the place. You fucking, you can't, you can't stay steady with a thought. Yeah. And, but I, I remember I met him a couple times. Paulie sure was very tight with him. Yeah. And I knew Pauline. And. I hung out with Kinison a couple times, but, but I saw him at the Improv the last time I saw him. And he had, he was a little, little, he was so sweet. Like, he was so nice to me. And he remembered that we hung a little bit, you know, I was a young fucking dummy and he was nice to me. And he had that, that kind of glazed had a few too many Yeah.


In the eyes. But he was just, he, he definitely was. When he walked into the fucking improv that night, every comedian was like, well, holy shit, there he is. Right. The fucking man. Right. you know, it was cool. He changed comedy. He really did. Yeah. Because there was no comedy like that before Kennison came around. He was a different kind of comedy. It was like all of a sudden comedy was like, you could yell, you know? Yeah. Wow. Oh my God. God. That the Biggest, he was just a force. He was just like, and the preacher's voice that thing that he had a, where he had that charisma of being this tent revival preacher. Yes. Yes. Everybody would talk quiet and Oh, well, and then all of a sudden blasted shit up And then blast.


Yes. Oh my God. And he was a legend at the store. you know, when I got to the, the store goes through these eras, right? Yeah. And when I got to the store, it was 94 and the Kinison era had ended. He died. Right. And then there was this big drop off. Like the store was kind of vacant when I got there in 94. It was weird. Like the shows would be half empty and Yeah. Yeah. They were having problems for a bit. Yeah. Yeah. But they all had these stories. All the guys like Harris, Pete and the guys that were still around. Yeah. They'd all have these stories about when Kinison was there. Yeah. He would perform at midnight and around 1130 all these rock stars would start showing up. Movie stars. Right? Yeah. And they would all go there to see Kennison.


Yeah. Yeah. And so he had the midnight spot. Fucking cool. And they would all go And I. Remember thinking, imagine people coming to the comedy store just to see you. Yeah. That must be so insane. That's Fucking cool as fuck. Oh, it was the coolest because it was all just word of mouth. Yeah. Man, everybody This is like 84 ish before he popped. Oh fuck. Everybody just knew about him. I, I rock, rock. I, I re I remember Chris was in Vegas, And I went to see him with Nicholson and Jim Brooks. Wow. And we were sitting there and fucking Nicholson was laughing his ass off. And. I had that thought. You just had, I was just going, fucking rock is so cool.


Right. That people fucking fly an hour. Like, where is he? Let me go see him. They sit back and laugh. And, I fucking crazy. Just going shit rock. You really are fucking stud, man. Oh Yeah. The bring the pain days bigger and blacker and bring the pain to the greatest specials of All time. Unbelievable. Of all time. Flawless. Flawless. Yeah. Yeah. He's a badass. I ta I talked to Rock yesterday just for like 10 minutes or something. And we got really excited about standup again. I go, you, you're right. And he goes, I kind am. I kind of like, he can't stop. When he was doing his tour, he's like, I need a break, blah, blah, blah. He just did like a fucking year on the road or some shit. Right. And then he's right back to like, got some ideas, got Some shit.


Yeah. I think that's a good way to do it. Take a little break and just refresh your mind. Yeah. So you're not running stale, you know? Of course. Because he did a live special too. His live special was, fuck. I loved it. I loved it. Yeah. And it was also like the buildup because of getting slapped by Will Smith and all that crazy shit. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I think that was like the best thing that ever happened to him, because then it became like wild again. Like his standup was like outrageous. Like, it was like the rock of old It that that night was like watching a fucking Super Bowl. He was just like, what? What's, it's a live event. Holy fuck. What the fuck? And and then he was badass. And I. Think he had some white shit on and he looked cool as fuck. And you were waiting for him to talk about it.


And Yeah. Then he got to it and he got fucking excited. Well, he didn't talk about it for a while. Yeah. Right. On stage. Like, he would tell people, if you think I'm gonna talk about it, I'm not. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. Yeah. He wanted to be ready and he wanted to really think about what he was gonna say and how to say That's, that's 'cause of where we are in life. Where anything you say is fucking on the internet the next day. So he's the next, I gotta be careful and not blow the shit up also. Right. Didn't ruin the bits. Yeah. 'cause people would just tell the bits and then Yes. And it wasn't even ready yet. Yeah, exactly. Because If you have a life changing event, like getting slapped at the Oscars in this most preposterous scenario, the whole thing was preposterous. Yeah. I think for him it was also a wake up call. Like, Hey, these motherfuckers don't really care about me.


You know, this is and that moment. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They didn't protect me. Nobody stopped it. He went back and sat down and then he got an award afterwards and got a standing ovation. What the fuck is is going on here? Whole Thing was fucking w weird. Yeah. Because you want, you always want to be that guy who's hosting the Oscars and who's starring in the big movies and Yeah. Yeah. That's what everybody wanted. Everybody wanted to be the big movie star. But then you realize like, well, these people are fuckers. you know? Like, what did you do? How did you set this up? How come nobody tackled him? That was a fucking weird moment. Oh, weird. Live weird. Yeah. Yeah. It was like a guy just showing his ass, like, you just pulled your pants down and showed the world your ass.


Like, why did you Do that? Yeah. I'm sure he probably doesn't, he probably wakes up in the middle of the night going, why did I do that? That whole thing sucks. That Yeah. Sucks beyond, it was almost like a guy who doesn't know how normal people act, thinking this is what you're supposed to do. Go smack that guy. It got it. Became fucking, just, just went to a place that he couldn't get out of. Yeah. And started it and, And still there. He's still there. Yeah. In, in everybody's mind. When you see Will Smith. Oh, he slapped Chris Rock. That's like, I mean not I am legend. Yeah. Not Muhammad Ali. Not insanely good movies. Yeah. Yeah. Guy's an incredible actor.


Absolutely. Yes. He's been in so many banger movies. Yeah. He's a fucking blockbuster movie star. Yeah. Yeah. And people see him, they go, oh, he slapped Chris Rock. Fuck that Guy. Fucking sucks. God damnit. Terrible man. That sucks, man. And fucking Yeah. It's, it follows you around. It sucks. But, but my man rock and the, and the kinisons, like, and the, that shit, when you, when you spread it, it happens like once every fucking eight years or something where somebody becomes this shit. Yeah. Every now and then someone pops through and it elevates all of us. Yes. Everybody that gets to see it, they'd go, oh my God, I wanna be better. I wanna write more. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. When I used to see Chris at the store Yeah. Whenever Chris would come in and he'd do a set, I would watch And.


I'd be like, oh my God. I remember one time I was fucking in the back of the room and this comic stood in front, like while I was watching Chris. He's like, dude, I gotta get on your podcast. I'm like, you gotta get the fuck away from me. I'm watching Chris Rock. Like, why are you watching Chris Rock? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's one of the greats and he's on stage right now. Yes. And you're talking to me. Holy Shit. Get The fuck outta Here. That's so funny, man. That Guy's never been on my podcast to this day. Oh. I'm like, get outta here. You, you ruined a moment. Get the Fuck outta here, Dude. Is he, he Rock is ne never wasted a fucking minute on stage. Right. Always trying shit out. Always was either notebook or just trying to remember or whatever. Never fucking got tense with the crowd.


Just as like, they're not liking this, but I'm liking it, so I'm gonna keep going. Well, he would do this thing where he would go on stage and he would just have raw premises. Right. And he was so comfortable with total silence. Yes, yes, yes. Where it wasn't going well. And then he would catch fire and then start killing. Yeah. Man. And then they're like, Oh, it is Chris Rock. Yeah. And then it would go right back. He was like using them as like a sounding board. You're right. And he would tell them like, I'm, I'm practicing. Yeah. you know, saying, I remember one time he went on, somebody fucking killed and he went on and the first thing he said, hold on, relax. It ain't gonna be that funny. All right. Right, Right, Right. Like told him it's Not gonna be that funny. Yeah. It's calm down. Exactly. It's Like I'm working on some shit. Yeah.


But that's how you develop a, a monster hour. Yes. You have to start off with building a structure. Yeah, man. Get a foundation and Yeah. You fucking, even your first night of the tour by the last night you go Now that's my act now. Yeah. The friends who saw you the first two nights, you're like, fuck, I wish you would've seen me fucking right. A couple weeks later. I had, I figured out that bit. Yeah. You don't want anybody to see you when you're doing a workout set. Like, get the fuck outta here. Oh man, Man, this is a workout set. This could be terrible. This could end badly. Especially when a buddy sees you eat it like that. What a feeling. Yeah. There's no dismount here. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, it's interesting how those guys like, like a guy like Rock or Kinison or Louis or anybody who's just like really killing it.


Yeah. It elevates everybody around you. Yeah. Man. Everybody, everybody gets a little better because of that, because he get, Get inspired. I fucking, I, I, I, I think Rock was on stage and just killed one time. And I. Remember John Stewart, who was probably 24 at the time. I, I think I was like 18 or, or 20 or whatever our age difference is. John Stewart goes, Ugh, I I don't want, I I quit. don don't, like, he was just like, God damn. That's good, man. Well, you know, that's what Eric Clapton said when he saw Jimi Hendrix. Yeah, yeah. He saw Jimi Hendrix. He's like, what am I doing? Fuck am I doing? Why am I doing this? You feel like a pony after you see, you got great shit. Yeah. Well, especially a guy like Hendricks that comes along and he's doing something completely different than everybody else.


Yeah. Man. Everybody else is playing guitar. They're all great. Yeah. And then all of a sudden this guy comes, Oh my goodness. I know. Oh, oh, that was a nasty One. Yeah. When I worked with Phil Hartman, he told me a story when he was 18 years old. He worked at the whiskey and he, his, his job was, they, they had those stage monitors and sometimes the stage monitors the, the, the artists would accidentally kick 'em and they would go into the crowd. So his job was to, 'cause they were, it was a, you ever been the whiskey? Yeah, sure. Yeah. Small stage, right? Yeah. Not that big. Yeah. And so when he would, he'd have to stand there, like, to be prepared to like catch the speaker and Hendricks Yeah.


Was right there, like, where you are. To Me, Hendricks was ah, and he was 18 years old. I see. And he, he goes, dude, it was insane. That, that's so funny, Man. He goes, I was, 'cause Phil could play a little guitar too, but he was watching. He's like, I'm watching literally the greatest guitarist of all time. Yes, yes. And he's three feet away from me. That's Fucking cool, man. Insane. And then Phil did all the, the album covers and shit. Remember he used to do The album? Oh yeah. I have one of them out here. Oh yeah. One of them framed. Yeah. Oh man. One of his album covers. He did a bunch of, he was a great artist. Yeah. He was a very interesting guy. Oh yeah, Yeah, yeah. He knew a lot of shit. He did so many different things. Yes, yes, yes. And he, he studied, so he made me feel like such a fraud. 'cause he would study his lines and he would have like little post-it tabs.


Yeah, yeah, yeah. Little different colored ones for different scenes and you have notes and all these different things. And he, he would like, prepare for, he'd be preparing the mirror, like doing Yes, yes, Yes. And I was like, God, you know, he was the pro for sure. Such a pro. I know. With everything. I know, man. Like when we were doing the show, he was getting his pilot's license. So like Oh yeah. Every day in between scenes, he would be like reading these pilot's manuals. Yeah. Yeah. He Was, he was just like surreal Dedicat into something. Yeah. Yeah. I lived in the same apartment building when I was on SNL as Phil. Oh, wow. So I'd see him, we'd go up on the elevators together and talk about shit. I was, you know, of course he was older. So you were just excited that he'd be talking to you.


Yeah. He was a cool motherfucker. Yeah. I remember the first day on the set of news radio. Like, I couldn't even believe he was really there. Yes. I Was like, looking over across the table, you know, doing the table read. And I'm like, how did I get on this fucking show? I didn't have, I had zero acting like I did this one. How'd you get it? This the craziest story. The whole thing's crazy. I did MTV half hour Comedy Hour. Right, right. You do like, whatever, five, seven minutes, Whatever that was. Who was the host Joiner? Yeah. Mario Joiner. Yeah. So I did MTV, half hour Comedy Hour, I got a development deal outta nowhere. Wow. For MTV. That's big. MTV was offering me a development deal. And then my manager started saying it was very little money. It was like 500 bucks.


And they were gonna lock me up for like three years. It was crazy. Low money. It was so stupid. But You would Join. but I was like thinking about doing, you Want me, let's do it. Yeah. Yeah. I was thinking about doing it because This is like, after remote control, and they'd made Dennis Leary famous. Yes. They had decided they were gonna lock people up to deals now, because Leary got famous off that. And then he took off and then kind of went away from MTV. I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So they had decided that they were gonna lock up talent. Correct. So they, so if I did this pilot, the pilot got picked up. I would've been there. So my manager said, he, he said, I have an idea. And so he decided to send my MTV tape out to all these studios and say, this guy's about to sign a development deal for, for MTV locked up.


But he's, he's still a avail. So then I started getting all these phone, like people would call my apartment. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I was at home like, hello? And they're like, hi, this is ba blah blah from Universal, you know? Right. We wanna get you on a plane right now to Los Angeles. I was like, what? Wow, man. So I called my manager, I called Sussy And. I was like, Hey dude, these fucking people are calling my apartment. He goes, don't answer your phone. He goes, go to the pool hall, don't answer the phone. And he goes, just leave it all to me. And so within like three weeks, I had this crazy deal for like $150,000, which is the most money I'd ever even heard of in my life. Oh yeah. And all of a sudden I was in Hollywood, like out of nowhere. So And I was on A, so was the deal with like CBS or It was With Disney with Di. Oh wow. Which is crazy 'cause I was filthy to me. Right? Yeah. Yeah.


But they Would, and all of a sudden, I have a deal with Disney And. I'm on this Fuck for that much Fox sitcom. And so I had to get acting lessons. So I took a few acting lessons. I hated it. I was like, this is gross. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then, but I knew how to just pretend. I'm like, I pretend on stage. I'll just pretend like sitcom acting is pretty easy. Right. And so all of a sudden I'm on this sitcom, it gets canceled, and I'm like, oh, I was thinking about moving back to New York. Yeah. but I was like, I hated la. I hated being around actors. Ah. You couldn't joke around with them. They were all so sensitive. Right. Everyone was on pills. They were all on antidepressants. It was like, wow. Get me outta here. I can't deal with, I wanna go back to comics. Yeah. And so I was ready to move back to New York and, but I had got this fucking apartment. I thought that the sitcom was gonna go.


So I got a lease on this beautiful apartment in North Hollywood. I had a loft in a pool table. I thought I was bawling. Wow. Yeah. you know, I was making like 20 grand a week. I was like, this is amazing. That's fucking big. Yeah. I'm crazy. I, I was like, I, I'm rich. Yeah. So I got this apartment. I'm like, well, I have this apartment. I can't just leave the apartment. Right. What the fuck do I do? Right. And so then I got another development deal. Geez. And then, so I, I'd gone, I'd gone two auditions in my entire life. One of 'em was hardball. Got that show. The other one was News Radio. I got that show. That's Fucking Crazy. It was made no sense. Yeah. Made no sense. And all of a sudden I'm sitting there and I'm sitting across from Phil Hartman. Yeah. I'm like, this is crazy. That's a Biggie. I just not, I had full Imposter syndrome. and that show fucking kept going for, for a while.


News Radio was big. No, it wasn't. It was, it wasn't. I thought it was Isn't that Brillstein Gray? Yeah. It wasn't big until after it was canceled. Oh, I see. And then it went into syndication. How many years did it? Five years. That's pretty good. Yeah. But it became Syndication. I gotcha. Really big in syndication. I see. I see. Maybe Four years or five. I think we did five years. We did a like 98 shows, which is like, Who, who else was on it? I forget. All of A sudden, Maura Tierney. She was great. Right, right, Right. Dave Foley. Amazing. That's right. Andy Dick. Yeah. Yeah. And that's how I met Farley through Andy. Right. And then Candy Alexander. She was awesome. Vicki Lewis, he was Steven Root. Amazing. Oh, right. So all it was a great cast. Yeah. And I. you know, I felt like a fraud. I was like, all these people have like, background and theater and background and films and movies and TV shows.


And I was just like this Dirty TV film made everybody feel that way. Every everybody was kind of like, well, he's, he's, he's the next level, But oh, he was the next level. Yeah. And he was so good. Him and Steven Root was so good too. Yeah. He was the only one that wasn't even himself. Everybody else was just being a version of Mul Stephen Root and, you know, he was a different human. Yeah. Like, he was a sweet, normal guy. And then he would play Jimmy James and he would just fall into this character. This like, Yes, yes, yes. He had a character just like when he was in Office Space. Yeah. Unbelievable. Yeah. So it was just, He's worship too. Yeah. Bizarre. Being on that show. 'cause I was 26, 27. Yeah. When I was on the show, And I was sitting making big money. Wow. But it was also confusing.


That, that's funny. I felt like such an imposter. I was like, someone's gonna figure out that don don't belong here. That's Funny. and that I'm have To go get A job. That's nice though. That's a good, that's a good person to be feeling like that. I think I was a cocky fuck who was like, yeah, baby. They figured it out. I'm here. but I literally didn't get shit growing up. I, I auditioned for shit and never got, nobody liked me. Really? Every audition. They were just like, I would talk to my agent after. I'd be like, you know, nervously asking what they, what they say, you know? And then they'd have to be, well, the, did you read the sides before? I'd be like, what do you mean? That's what they said. Of course. I read the sides. They were like, I thought you didn't know it that well.


I go, what I thought, I, I I thought I knew it real well. They didn't like it. do you think that you're, they would use words to kind of be gentle with me, but just say you're not, you're not ready yet. Well, it's funny how you have confidence when you're young and you really do think that you're ready. Like, I remember thinking that like at Open Mic nights, like, you'd see someone on stage and they were bomb. My God, I wish I could go up there. Yeah. Well, I was terrible. Yeah. I would've bombed too. Yeah, of Course. Yes. But you Wonder Chance, or watching another actor and you go, and when you were young and you'd see someone your age on a show, you'd be like, oh, what's what? What? I could fucking crush that shit. Right. And then you realize looking back, oh, that guy was pretty fucking good.


Yeah. Well, news Radio was fortunate. 'cause I got to play like a more retarded version of myself. It was like, basically like in a lot of conspiracy theories and Oh, Okay. And delusional. It was like a version of me. So, so the, the writers are Very smart. Did they know that they were writing it Way figured out. I see. Figured Me out after a while and started writing stuff in. That's funny. you know, I would talk to 'em about fucking UFO projects, Man, that were top Secret shit. And then they put all that kind of stuff in the script. That's cool. Because I was into stupid things. I was fascinating. You got into that shit real young. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I was I Alone in your head? Or you just some You had somebody who brought it up to you and you started going with That?


Well, with conspiracies. I, a friend of mine who was in a band gave me a book Once on the Road. And it was a book called Best Evidence by this guy David Lifton. It's all about the Kennedy assassination. He's like, you gotta read this. Wow. The government killed Kennedy. I was like, what? Okay. Gotcha. Remember reading this book going, what the fuck? Right. I read this book. It was just really funny. And I went on stage after I read it and bombed And I And I. I apologized to the club owner. I was like, look man, I'm funny than that. I, I read This fucking book. My mind wasn't right. And they're like, don't read it tomorrow. I go, I promise I'm not gonna read It tomorrow. Tomorrow. And I killed And. I killed the next night. 'cause I put the book down. And I said, you gotta be.


That's, but I didn't bomb terrible, but it was flat. It wasn't good. I was in a weird head space. Yeah. I was like, Jesus Christ. They killed the President. Yeah. I was like, this is nuts. That's funny, man. Wow. It fucked you up. It fucked me up. And then it got me down this conspiracy spiral. Yeah. So I started questioning things. Yeah. It's like, what else don't I know? Wow. And I started reading about all kinds of different things that I didn't know. That's Fucking amazing, man. I read This book called The Strange Death of Vince Foster. It's all Vince Foster guy who worked with Clinton, who got murdered in a very, they said it was a suicide, but he had the gun in his hand. There was less buddy, but less blood at the crime scene than was missing from his body. It seemed like his body had been transported to the crime scene. Oh Wow. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was like, geez, Christ.


Oh, those things will fuck you up. Fascinating shit. Yeah. If, if you get involved in reading books like that and, and you get, your head gets filled with that kind of shit, You know, Quinn was like that too. Oh yeah. Quinn Quinn read a lot of shit. And he would tell me to read stuff. And I remember he knew a lot about crazy mass murderers and shit. And I would start going, what happened? And he would tell me these things. And I. Remember telling my dad some of the shit Qui Quinn told me about. I don't remember who, but I'd be like, and then this guy, blah, blah, blah, and Ted Bundy and this and that. And my father started getting like, my son a fucking murder. Why is he talking so much about murderer so Much? Joey Diaz gave me this book called Murder Machine Once. And it's about Roy Deo.


Do you know who Roy Deo was? I'm not sure know. He was a serial killer who worked for the mob. And he, he would kill people. Like they had a bar downstairs and they had an apartment upstairs. He would kill people and then cut 'em up in the bathtub upstairs. Yeah. And just killed a bunch of fucking people. It's a horrific book. Right. And. I. Remember reading that going, Jesus. Fuck. Just knowing that there's people, oh, it's terrify out there. Terrify the World. It's terrify. Oh my God. And you just get in the wrong fucking place at the wrong time. Wrong guy shows up at your house. Oh boy. Oh boy. Yeah. Wow. It was just like, those things are terrible to read before you go on stage though. Fuck your brain up. That's so funny that you ate it because of that book, Man.


Oh yeah. I've eaten it a couple times. 'cause I did the wrong thing before I went on stage. One time I had a gig in New Jersey, and it was a college and I had a, it was a weird place to get to. It was back in the day before navigation. So they would Give You the, the directions over The phone. Right. You get fucked up. Yeah. Like you go to 4 0 5 to get off this exit. Correct. They, so they give me the directions. And I get there. I leave early 'cause they tell me it's really hard to get to And. I get there about a half hour early. Yes. But it was hard to get. I was like, Jesus Christ, this place hard to find. Yeah. And I was working with JB Smooth. Wow. And JB was supposed to open And. I was supposed to close. And they said, J B's not here yet. So why don't you just relax in the, the rec room and, and sit down and, and we'll tell you when the show's gonna start.


So I sit down and I'm, I'm watching this documentary on the Malibu Fires. And it's all these people, like, people lost their family, lost their house. House is burned. This little kid walking around looking for his dog. Rusty, where are you Rusty? Oh, fuck you up Rusty. Yes. Yelling for their dog. Your dog's dead. Right. And there was this fireman who was just weeping and crying. Oh, my, the people in this community lost his house. And then they come in the green room, they go, look, jbs not here yet, so we're gonna have you open up. And oh my God, Hopefully when you Get off stage, he's gonna go up. I'm like, okay. And I mean the fucking we're, I'm crying, God. I was literally crying Watching this thing about these people losing everything in these fires. It was horrific.


Oh my God. And I went on stage, just ate Shit. That's Terrible. And then finally JB shows up and he showed up and he went on after me and murdered. Because He was, he Was loose and happy. He came in the right mood. Didn't watch that shit. Yeah. And He's a killer. Anyway. He's very funny. Anyway. Yes. Yeah. And I. Remember thinking, God, you can't do that. Yeah. And I was with my girlfriend at the time, and she was like so disappointed in me. Like, Wow, what was wrong with you? But she's seen you kill before. Yeah. She knew I was funny. It's funny, man. What's wrong with you? I go watch that fucking thing That I have similar, it's not from watching something or, or I have moments where I'm driving to a club and I'm in this fucking mood where I'm going, oh my God, I ain't gonna fucking destroy And. I have such a, like the last two hours been in the right mood.


Maybe some fucking song comes on. I'm like, oh, fuck that. Fuck me up a little bit. That song. Yeah. And then I walk in, then I'm in this fucking weird mood. I'm a little down. I get on stage. All of a sudden I let the crowd own me. I'm like, what the fuck happened? I was so ready to kill tonight. And I fucking turned into something. Yeah. You're in the car. Just Yesterday morning. They lemme know you were gone. That's a good one. No. Oh No. Oh yeah. Man. Suzanne, the Plans, they may put an empty, oh, Why am I here? You get sad. You can't get sad before you go on stage. You gotta protect your mind. My Fuck. My wife helps me out. Sometimes when she sees my head spinning before I go up, she goes, they're here to see you.


They're here to see you. Oh, that's good. They like you. You don't have to worry so much. I'd be like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. They're already, they're here for the good time. Yeah. Don't f then you know they're not testing you. Right. Go have some fun with 'em. I go, yeah, no, no, no, you're right. You're right. And then I go, fuck, let me go on happy. 'cause the times I go on fucked up and being like, yeah, this guy's gonna like me. Or am I gonna have to fight? I'm like, I, I've have fucked up Over there. That's why, to me, one of the things I've realized early on is take people on the road with you. 'cause in the early days when I was headlining, they would have like a local middle act and a local opener. And sometimes it'd be fun. That's right. And sometimes it'd be terrible. Yeah. Sometimes the guy would be a douche bag.


Yeah. They're like, why are you fucking closing? Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And they would step on your material. Like they'd see your set first night and then they'd cover the same subjects. Holy Shit. You'd have to argue with him. Why do do, forgot about that? Hey man, you do. You're doing one of my fucking bitch. No man. I've been doing that bit like, I mean fuck you. Ah. And like, there was like a lot of sabotage going on. Right. And it just wasn't fun. 'cause then you'd be stuck in this town. You didn't know anybody there. Oh yeah. You just watching tv. Go to the movies by yourself In the condo. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Depressing. Yeah. And so I realized like, if you could go on the road with funny people, you're gonna have fun. Well, yeah. It's good for them. 'cause they get a gig. So I just have to pay the opening act. And, I'd have to pay for their airfare. And I would make less money, but I would have more fun.


I was like, more fun is more important than anything. Absolutely. And it's more important for the show too. You go up in the right frame. Always. Yeah. And I know that the comics in front of me are gonna be really good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it's gonna be a good show. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Like, I want the audience to have fun, love. but I wanna have have fun too. Love that. Yeah. So then it was a party. Then I'd be on the road with Joey Diaz and we'd be having a party everywhere we go, Man, he's funny. We'd Be just having fun. Yeah. And it became family. It was like we, wherever we were, it didn't matter if we were in Ohio or New Jersey. It was us. We were laughing. Daytime daytime's fun. Yeah. Have dinner together, then go fucking do your shit and stay up all night. Yeah, I know. But Joey was such a wild card that it was, this was back in the, the Joey the Cocaine days.


This Is Coco, Joey Coco. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I used to, I brought a second opening act in case Joey didn't show up. Wow. Yeah. Yeah, Yeah. Yeah. That makes some sense. Because sometimes I didn't want tell him he couldn't do the gigs. Hey, you're not reliable. Yeah. Because I loved him. Course of course. And. I love being, I'm like, the times that he's there are so magic. Sure. I wanna make sure that he knows. He's always gotta get What a fucking Funny one. So I'd book him and then like, sometimes I'd book him and we'd do Friday and Saturday. Yeah. And then I'd call him on Sunday. I'd go, Hey, the show's seven o'clock. I'm going back home. Like, whatcha talking about, you know, I don't do Sundays. Like, whatcha talking about? You don't do Sundays. I told you Joe Rogan. I don't do Sundays. Oh, You don't do, You never told me you don't Do Sundays. You on May. Yeah. We have a Show in an hour. I told you. Yeah. And so having a third opening act would, or a second opening act Would perfect.


And you say you gotta do longer. Yeah. Yeah. What would be like, I'd bring Ari. So if it was me and Ari Shafi is like, okay, Ari does 25 minutes and then I'll do an hour and 15 or whatever. And we got a great show. Yeah. Yeah. Man. And if Joey shows up, okay. Ground now we got a three man show. Funny man. Perfect. I Love that. So I, I scheduled it just so, yeah. you know, we'd always have some sort of a fail safe. Yeah. It's fucking way more fun. Like when I won't go out with the the gang. Good lord. Yeah. We have a good time, man. Yeah. You're Having Fun. It's fucking, and you write shit. Yes. You want. 'cause you wanna make them laugh. Exactly. Instead of doing the same fucking shit over and over, you're just like, Hey, yeah, I'm gonna try some new shit out tonight. And then your buddies come out and watch you and it's exciting.


And you watch them and you gotta tag. And you're having a Good time. You steal their shit. Yeah. But you're, you're having a good time. Yeah. Everyone's having a good time. Absolutely. Which to me was like, way more important than making X amount of thousand dollars more. I'd rather give them that money and then we all have fun. Yeah. That's, that to me was the best way. I, I fucking, when I was real young, I started at 17. And I had a car. And I. So I used to get booked a lot because I would drive the good guys, you know? Right. but I noticed that it was always three of us, me and the two other fucking guys who were good. And they would have the best time together. They fucking think I sucked. but I was fine. I was just getting to be with the guys who were like 25.


I was 17, 18, they were 25 shooting the shit, you know, getting into trouble, but going on stage and destroying, but I. And then you'd see 'em fucking hanging in the hotels and shit. And, and always having the best night. And I'd be like, yeah, that seems like the way that I was on my own. Still. They would kind of be like, that fucking Adam Guy. He'll take us home. But he's I don. I didn't think he was that funny. But, but fucking learned from seeing these superstar guys on the road. Fucking have fun. Isn't it funny how sometimes those guys always think of you as that guy? Oh, They, they relationships are the same. Yeah, exactly. They're still like, Hey, what's up? They're like, I know you fucking went on And I.


Remember when you sucked? Yes. Exactly. Which is why you have to get outta your hometown. And you back to Yeah. Yeah. You talked, I, I'm, I still let 'em own me. These guys. I'm like, yeah. All right. You did see me suck. You're right. Well, that's why you have to get outta your town. 'cause they always remember you as an open mic. Hell Yeah. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. Like, I didn't get any like, headlining gigs in Boston. Wow. Wait, where did you play? You played Stitches. Did you Stitches Nicks comedy Stop. Yeah. Yeah. Connection. Connection. What a room. It was a great room. Fucking incredible. The little one. Geez, the little one was the best. A Tight low Ceiling. It Was two. Yeah. Yeah. Low ceiling. That's one I 50 seats. Yeah. It was stalked Stuffed in there. Bumper To bumper. Fucking it was packed. It was, it was a fucking time.


I, yeah. Played against Sam's. Was that Oh yeah. Yeah. I did play it against Sam's. That place was great. And what was the one that was a Chinese restaurant? Calhoon. SGA. In sga. Right? Yeah. When then the Ding Ho was the beginning. DI wasn't there for that one. Oh. I think that's the one I did. That place went under a few years before I started. you know, so by, when I came around, I had missed like the heyday of Boston com. It was like 84. And I came around in 88. That's when I Started. Gotcha. Okay. So they would always talk about the Ding Ho. And there was all these d Yeah. Killers. I did like Lenny Clark, all these guys from The Dingo Didn't fuck with Lenny Clark. A lot of Tony V Tony v some, some of these guys. You just couldn't fucking, you just would watch 'em go, how the fuck can I kill like that?


Well, those guys had, as you said, they had the same act for like 15 years. and that act was like hammered down like a samurai sword. Yeah. Yeah. It was so tight. Oh, it was great. Like Don Gavin so tight. Ah, yeah. You'd see his act like Jesus Christ. This guy would murder Fucking Tommy Sledge. Do you remember? He, he, he, he, he was pretended to be a private eye. I backed off. I moved on. But he was funny as shit. Yeah. That's some of those guys. About some of those guys and some of those ladies. Man, they murdered and, and Yeah. Did you ever see that documentary when Standup stood out? Nah. Fran Alto made this great documentary about the heyday of Boston Comedy called When Standup Stood Out.


Right, right, right. And it was all about the transition between these guys being these local comics that were as good as anyone in the world. Yeah. And then Steven Wright becomes famous. Wow. And then Steven Wright gets on The Tonight Show. He becomes this world, was it Letterman or The Tonight Show that he first did, I forget what it was, but he became, he becomes huge. Yeah. And then they're all, now everyone's like, scrambling. Like, what did we do? Yeah. Like, we didn't, we didn't have an act that translated outside of Boston. Yeah, that's, that's true. Back then it was very Boston, Very, very Local. Steven Wright, definitely in my high school. Holy shit. Everybody knew every, it was like Rodney. He was like right after Rodney. Yeah. You'd repeat his jokes.


You couldn't believe it. And, and everyone was like, he's fucking so smart. I used to work at a fire hydrant factory. You couldn't park anywhere near the place. Yeah. Unbelievable. It's ridiculous. I think I tried to write like Kim in the beginning. I think I, as a standup did like 10 different guys. I didn't know who I wanted. Right. I didn't know what was Right. I was doing like Bobcat kind of shit. I'd do a character. I, I didn't know what the fuck. But Steven Wright, we'd always, me and my buddy, we'd kind of try to write in that vein of a little weird and make you thinking what a, what a cool joke. I don't fucking know. But I also, remember all those guys got popped by the IRS 'cause they were standups.


Yeah. They all got popped. 'cause none of 'em were paying taxes. They Were all getting paid. Paid cash. Cash. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's, and so they all got in trouble. I remember working at Nick's comedy stop, they offered, you could get paid in cash or in Coke. Yeah. Yeah. I remember those days. Yeah. That's how wild those those days were. Yeah. Yeah. And so these guys were just animals. Yeah. They were all getting paid cash. Yeah. They were drinking and partying every night. Yes. Yes. And they were headlining. And there's one time during the heyday where Nick's comedy stop had three rooms running simultaneously. That's right. Yeah. And they'd have two shows a night in each room. So these guys would do six sets. Amazing. And they were making bank and they all had a deal. Yeah. Like the way Nicks, Nicks had them set up where they, they were Nick's comics, exclusives.


And so they would just work for Nicks. But they gave you so much work. Yeah. You, you didn't want to Branch out. You Didnt wanna the road they the road too. Right. Dave's Had a few road Gig. This I remember Bill Downs was Oh yeah. Remember Connection. He Used to book me on the road too. I worked for a private investigator when I was starting out, when I was an open micer. And this private investigator was Bill Downs' cousin. And. I didn't find out about it until after I started working for him. Wow. And to this day, one of the funniest guys I've ever met in my life, just never did standup. Yeah. He was, his name was Dick Dolan. You call Dave Dolan rather, he call himself Dynamite. Dave Dickless. Dave Dolan. And he went to Dickless Dave. He was fucking hilarious.


I have a phone that I, he died a couple years back, but I have a phone that I saved. Yeah. And I'll never get rid of because it got a voicemail on that phone from him where he called me up. He was like, I did a gig in Boston. And I hung out with him and was like, Hey, Joe. Like this. He was just a Boston character. Right. Just a hilarious dude. Yeah. Yeah. And he was cousins with, with Bill Downs Funny man, which is just Small One Bill Downs. What a guy. That guy used to book me all the time, even though even when I would do bad, he'd be like, I heard it didn't go that good. I'd be like, yeah. And I'm in my head. I'm like, okay. It's over. Big Guy. Yeah. Yeah. He'd call you big guy. Hey, big guy. Oh, hey, big guy. Yeah. Yeah. I heard it didn't go that good big guy. Yeah. Right, right, right. Yes. Yeah. I know.


But then he fucking get me another gig. Oh yeah. In Quincy, there was some place in Quincy, I forget the name of that one. The n The Naughty Pine. Did you ever work for Dick Dougherty? Don? Don't think so. You never did Dick Dougherty's Comedy Huts? don Don't think so. Dick Daughty was the Godfather. He called himself the Godfather of Boston Comedy. Oh, okay. He had a bunch of terrible Games. Was that like 88 on? Yeah. Yeah. 88 on, I fucking was in the scene in Boston more from 84 to 88. Okay. So you were in the heyday. I was in the So you got There like, Right. I got there and it was huge. I wasn't great. But then Buddy, all of a sudden I got on Saturday Night Live, don don't know, 89 or something.


And those same guys would come see me. All of a sudden, I got big into colleges. And I was doing these fucking giant shows back then. It was unbelievable. you know, 2000, 3000, 5,000 seats. And the guys that I used to eat it in front of would come do the gigs with me. And they'd watch me. They'd be like, that fucking lose losers. Kill it. Now the fuck did that happen? It's again, the thing, when they see you in the beginning, they never respect you. Right. Right. They, they remember you sucking. Yeah. They were right. They were right back then. Yeah. But it's, it's hard for people to accept that you grew.


Yeah. Which is weird. That's true. That's true. It's like some fucking pro athletes. It's like, like Jordan fucking wasn't the man for a while. Right. He got cut from his high school team. Right. Exactly. Yeah. That shit's gonna happen through in every, every, every profession that you, you just gotta get, figure out what your, you just gotta Practice. Well, did you always want to be on SNL? Or was it something that came out? Kind of, I didn't even know. It wasn't that thought. I wanted to be a movie star. I was cocky and telling my friends in college, I'm gonna be a fucking movie star. They'd be like, why, why would you be a movie star? Look at you. You got fucking, I'd be like, you don't get it, man.


I'm fucking And I thought I was good looking too. I thought I was good looking. Like, now I go, how the fuck did I think I like, I know I'm normal looking, but I thought there was something fucking attractive about me that people are gonna be like, that's a fucking stud right there. And no, I, I then, I think I was doing standup, Dennis Miller said good shit about me to, to SNL people. And then Sandy Wernick was my manager, and he knew all of them. And they got me an audition, and then I did it. And then they hired me as asked me to be a writer. And I remember saying to Hur Lehi, who, who knew more about SNL? I didn't watch SNL that much.


I was kind of lost. They were like, it's really good that Dana Carvey iss incredible And I go. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's great. He's great. And they were like, And I was like, but, but I kind of want to get in the movies. And they were like, and my buddies were like, you should do SNL if there's that choice. you know, And I Was like, so you were thinking about not doing well? I Wasn't, I wasn't sure. Wasn't sure. I was kind of like, let's see, let's see. I don't, I'm not a writer, so why am I gonna become a writer? It doesn't make any sense. I'm not even that fucking good at that. What was the audition like? What did you have to do? I did stand up at, in Chicago improv. It was me, rock, Dana Gould and a couple other guys. And I did Decent. And SNL people thought I wrote some funny shit.


Lauren thought I wrote some funny shit. Robert Smigel thought I had some shit. And then I got on. Wow. And Spade was on. How old were you? I was 23. Whoa. Yes. That was big. That's nuts. That's As cool as it gets. Yes. What is, what was that feeling like? It was all of a sudden it became like you were in a rock band. Because I had, you know, Farley got on and fucking rock and spade and, and we would walk down the street in Schneider and Norm, and we all were Tim Meadows. We were just always together. So there, there was this crazy band confidence. Wow. you know, if anyone talked shit about the show, we were at a restaurant.


Like, it wasn't that good this Saturday. We were just like, shut the fuck up, man. Like, we were fucking ready. 'cause there was so many of us. you know, it was like, but then when you were alone and somebody says, I saw you, you kind of like, huh. Yeah. you know, there's something cool about having a bunch of guys with you. Oh yeah. It's confidence. Yeah. You got, you got a team. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. 23. What was it like, like when, when it was pomp? 'cause you were on a great era of SNL too. Yes. Yes. Look at that fucking cast. Yes. Yes. Harbin Tim Met. Look at that. Yes. Fucking cast.

And Ellen cla Horn I knew from the comic strip. Wow. And, and Melanie and Julia. All, all cool. All cool. Very tight. Became, but we all loved kneeling. Every, every comedian loves kneeling. Every, everybody like liked the way he dropped jokes in and fucking smooth as smooth as hell. Isn't it crazy looking at yourself back then? I fucking don't know what I was thinking. Spade sent me a, a fucking skit we did like six months ago. And I was like, this is the first time it's ever happened. Spade. I don't fucking remember that one ounce. I don't even know what that thing was about.


I don't remember what it was. but I Go, I didn't remember saying any of those words. I didn't know what the jokes were. I didn't know what the fucking ending was. And he's like, you don't, he said, I don't fucking remember that when you did. He goes, I sort of did. But it was weird. That's how I know I'm, I've been doing this so fucking long that this shit, I know I've been doing this shit long. When somebody comes up to me, a big famous motherfucker, and we go, Hey man, And, I, go, Hey, nice to meet you. And he's like, nice to meet you. We met. And I'm like, I fucking didn't remember meeting you. What the fuck happened? Well, you, your brain gets overwhelmed with people. Yeah. you know that number, Dunbar's number? Do you know what that is? No. Dunbar's number is a principle that you can only keep like 150 people in your head at any given time.


And then there's some people that you can keep kind of like in a distance, like acquaintances, but there's like a tight group of a small number. And then as it branches out, it gets to like 150. Everything after that is very sketchy. Wow. And when you're famous, you're constantly meeting people. Yes. Which is very unusual for human beings. Right? That's right. Yeah. There you go. Very unusual. Also very unusual that they know you, but you don't know them. Right. So there's this weird thing Yeah. Where you go nice to meet you like we met. Yeah. Like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I forgot. Sorry. It's not like I don't like you. It's not, I don't care. I'm not mean. I got hit My brain hit with a bunch of 'em today. Yeah, Yeah. Your brain's overwhelmed with, with people. Right. There's no room. Right. You don't have room. It's like, remember the old phones where you can only keep like a hundred contacts?


you know? You only had this, saw the phone. It had like one Yes. Fucking little tiny Yeah. Hard drive. Yeah. And once you got over a certain, nobody keeps a hundred people on your phone. How funny. Yeah. and that was, that's all it could take. And that's how your brain is. Yeah. Your brain doesn't have room for all these people. Yeah. So it's not even your fault. It's like your brain's not designed to be famous. No one's brain is designed. Never thought of it like that. That's great. That's what it is. That's great. Yeah. And then when you've done so many things, like as many things as you have, it's just normal that you're gonna forget. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. When the pandemic was going on, my kids found out about news radio. Like they didn't know about because don don't, you Don't talk about your Shit. Yeah. I'm don don't they?


They're fucking, they don't, they're not impressed by me. My Kids, I got the Same. My kids dis me all the time. Right. They're always cracking jokes at me. It's fun. It's like, it's fun. We talk a lot of shit. But it's fun. But you know, they watched me on News Radio, And I watched one of the scenes. I was like, don don't even remember this right at all. Oh, you had that too, right? Oh Yeah. I didn't remember It at all. This don't remember being there. Don't remember that room. Remember? Not occasionally I'll remember like four or five episodes. Oh yeah. I remember that one. That was a fun episode. That's funny, man. Yeah. But it's weird. you know, your brain just doesn't have any room for it. It's almost like it's a lie. Like, I didn't do that. This is Why this is, oh my God, this Is ai. By the way, not one time have I ever looked back at that shit from 30 years ago and go, whoa, was I good?


I'm always like, geez. Yeah. What the fuck were you doing? What a fucking horrible performance there. Well, I think that's probably a good sign. Yeah. That's a sign of a person who's not egocentric and Right, right, right. You kind of have a good sense of who you are. Yeah. Yes. I, I hope so. I hope The people that think everything they did is amazing. You ever go over someone's house and they might want you to watch something that they've done. You're like, don't make me do this. Oh, that's a toughie. Don't make me do this. You gotta watch my reel. Like, No, no. That's a roughy. Don't Make me watch this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can say to me, you don't want this to, don't do this, man, don't do this. This is for the best. Also, I'll start shitting on you. Yeah, yeah. If you play that, I'm gonna start shitting on you. That's funny, man.

I was fucking never more excited to call home and talk to my New Hampshire buddies and be like, eh, I mean, remember all that shit? I said that was gonna happen. It's fucking happening. And, I don't have to bullshit right now. It's really going. And then when I would get on the show, say one line, whatever it was just like my parents, my family, my friends.

He, but he was trapped in that character that he did that screaming crazy. Pull your hair out character. Yes. you know, it's like, there's guys that have characters like Emo Phillips, he had that creep. Wow. Yeah. I loved him.


Yeah. But you can't do that when you're 80. Yes. I know. you know, it's like, I know. It's like you track. but I was trying to do that. That's what I'm saying. When I was young, And I wasn't doing well. I was like, I started doing a guy who was drunk on stage. I started doing a guy who was very nervous. I don don't know. I was, I was going for that shit too. Just trying to find it. I didn't know what, yeah. I trying to be comfortable on stage, you know? Right. And That's also, That's what you had going on your live show. I was like, oh shit. Comfortable. Fucking not terrified. You, you sat in moments. Not, not easy to do. you Know, I was in the zone. You Were in the zone. How the, how about the fact that you got in the zone? When there are times when you walk on that stage in these pressure moments, you just go, I'm here, I'm talking, but I'm not here right now.


Right, right. My mouth is moving. I don't know what the fuck is going on. You didn't have that though. Well, I'd been through a bunch of those before. So I knew never to let that happen when I was out there and the live show. And it, it's also why I was scared of doing it. So I just really over-prepared. It's big. I made sure that when I got out there, I was just, I just said to myself, everything that I'm talking about, every time I, I want to be only thinking about that subject. don. Don't, I'm not gonna let my mind deviate or go, oh my God, this is going good. Fuck This up. Rag shit. Don't fuck up this pre segue. Don't fuck this up. Don't fuck. That's Funny. You Can't think like that. You have to. I, I felt like when I'm at my best, I'm only thinking about the thing I'm talking about.


Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then the, you lock the audience in. Yes. I think standup is a form of hypnosis. Yes. Do you think so too? Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I get exactly what you're saying. You Lock them in, lock to the way you're And. I. When I'm seeing a guy kill on stage. Yeah. I'm locked in to the way they're thinking. I'm letting them think for me. I'm just like, think for me. Right. you know, and they're, this is so funny. And it's like, it's a form of hypnosis. And I said the only way that that's gonna really work is I have to just be completely dialed in. Like I, I wrote out all my bits. I listened to recordings, I watched videos. I prepared for five hours the day of the show. Wow. Just watching video. I went to the gym. And in the gym I'm listening to my set.


Listen to see your old shit. Yes. Yeah. I'm just like, I want to be just dial, I get like that. Yeah. Yeah. 100% dialed in. Oh, That's a fucking great feeling. Yeah. When you go, I know all my shit, man. Because sometimes I'll do a tour, then I'll break down for two weeks 'cause I got, you know, I can't be gone too long. And then I go, oh shit, I got a gig again Friday. And then I listen to the shit on, yeah. And then I start going, oh yeah. Oh yeah. Fuck. Fuck. But if you forget tags, you forget. Oh God. Yeah. But then that two week break on a tour and then you go back out, man, you're psyched to say that shit Again. Oh yeah. And you come up with other shit to say And Yeah. But you do have to go over the material. Your brain doesn't remember anymore.


No, no, no. Like you, your stuff just goes away. What about you with having shit that steps on and that the hardest part of doing an hour is fucking having the 10 minutes up front not hurt the fucking next 10. It's just so crazy. I Caught a lot of stuff, you know. but I, it's been six years since my last special. Like I said, I was thinking about doing a special in August of 2020. Yeah. Then the country shut down. And then I didn't do standup for eight months. And when I did do standup again, I remember I had to listen to old recordings. Yeah. Luckily I record everything. Oh, that's good. I have all my recordings on my phone, so I'd listen to stuff. Oh, that's smart man. And, I had to write things out. but I remember the first set that I did, I did the Houston Improv.


And. I hadn't done standup in forever. And I. Remember when I was on stage, I was like, Ooh, this is weird. I had never, in my whole career, I got knee surgery. And from my knee surgery I took two weeks off. That was like the most I had ever taken off. Ever. And I. Think one other time I took a month off for some reason. I forget why, but that was weird too. But that was like, when I was in the middle of a bunch of other stuff, I was just working so much I didn't have any time. And then I remember that was And I. Don't do that again. 'cause it feels awkward to get back. But eight months was crazy. Yeah. Yeah. It was just such a bizarre feeling. Yeah. You forget how to do it. Yeah. But it, it's kind of even just two weeks, take two weeks and go back on stage again. You feel weird. Like, what am I doing? It's all new shit to your brain.


Again, it's Also the, the experience of doing it is weird. Yeah. you know how to do it, but it just Yes. Feels, it doesn't feel comfortable. What a fucking odd feeling when you think about going on stage and just going, yeah. I'm basically telling all you people just watch me. Yeah. For an hour. Right. Just watch me. You're gonna, it's worth your time. I know you drove, you got babysitters. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. This is, here we Go. Yeah. You bought tickets in advance. You planned your day Out. What a psycho of a human being could just go, lemme fucking come look at this. Yeah. You have to be outta your fucking mind or just really prepared. Yeah. Man. You'd be so prepared. My, my special, this one I did probably two and a half hours of shit and had to cut it.


We, you know, josh, ty, and we all had to pick the right. The shit we thought was the right shit. Mm. That's but I. I did have so much shit by the time I did the special, I, I just came off the road and so I just had Where'd you record it? We place in Glendale at a little theater. Oh, cool. Hey, can I, I'm sorry to interrupt. Can I hit it? Can I pee for one? Yeah, we can wrap this up. We, we've, we've done two hours and 40 minutes. We did. Yeah. This is, we've been in that long. Yeah, we've been in that long It fucking Insane. This is the setup. Look At this. Oh, that's my first, my first Netflix. I like the backdrop. The backdrop too. That's cool. It's just normal. Normal. That's cool.


Yeah. That's cool. It's like, did you set it up like that? Or is that just what it looked like back there? That that was it. That was that theater. I forgot the name of that theater. It's a Cool, so just left it the way it looks perfect. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That actually that day was, you know, Paul Thomas Anderson, the great, great guy and a great director. He, he shot that Shit. How many people were there in the crowd? Some that one there, that's that first special I did like five, six years ago. That some are like big ass joints, you know, like big arenas and some are like 200, 300. But the new one, the New one was only like don don't know, 200, 200 people, two 50. Oh wow. It was real small. Nice. That's a great way to do it too, because the people that are in the audience.


Yeah. There, there's 200 people. Like, so people at home, it's gonna be like you're there instead of being in an arena where you like, you feel disconnected. You can laugh at the jokes, but you don't feel like you're there. That, That's exactly what, so Josh Sty, he directed it. He wanted it to feel like you're getting to hang out with me. And it's kind of like just shit goes on throughout the show. That's, that's wasn't supposed to happen. And, and that's that it shows me before a show, during the show and after the show, and man, we had fun. It is a great fucking vibe. That place that was not a comedy club, it was just a little theater that They do. These people bought a theater, they put on little plays there and shit.


And then Josh liked it and they made it kind of feel like a standup. That's awesome. And when is it out? What day? The 27th? August 7th. 27th. Yeah. Okay. Just a couple weeks from now.
