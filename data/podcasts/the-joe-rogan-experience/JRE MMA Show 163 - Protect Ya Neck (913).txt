2 (1m 48s):
The goofiest looking one. Is the tattooed ring. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0 (1m 51s):
That one's goofy. It's color

2 (1m 52s):
Almost as different. Bad as the the bicep with the fucking chain. With the, you know, the old

0 (1m 58s):
School barb wire, barbed wire. I'm actually, I'm actually wearing my marble ring. It says marble on. There you go. Good man. Man. Actually say Mar your wife must shake your fucking head this

2 (2m 27s):
Use it like a slingshot.

0 (2m 28s):
That's great.

2 (2m 29s):
Yeah. I, I heard about a dude in God, I forget whose, whose gym, one of the, one of the, some big name dude. And he took a photo of one of his students and said, don't ever come onto my mat with a ring on ever. Oh my God. This is what happens. And he posted it.

0 (2m 45s):
I

2 (2m 46s):
Don't remember who posted it, but fuck man's. It's like, you can't, it's just too dangerous. I never, you basically have a, a metal wedge on your fingers. Right. if you do anything heavy, if you're in the outdoors, if you're climbing something, it, it can just dig right into your meat and rip your fucking finger apart.

0 (3m 2s):
When I was, when I was, when I was fighting, when I was champ, I had the, I just got married. I was telling you earlier, and, and when I had the ring on, this is before they had the rubber rings. You know and, and guys get excited to see you. So sometimes you give 'em the hand, they, they squeeze your fingers and it felt smashed. So excited. Smack Sarah. You try to be nice. It's like, get my hand down, motherfucker. It, it was, I

2 (3m 27s):
Wonder if that's why you wear a wedding ring on your left hand. So you, because you shake hands with your Right. I wonder if that's, I mean that's good. That's good idea. That totally makes sense. It

0 (3m 36s):
Doesn't, especially, I hate those douche bags that always try to give you that fucking, they have a nice squeeze. Try to, they grab the tips and they try to, that they try to break your

2 (3m 43s):
Hand. Don't, I don't like when that gets on my fucking nerve. They wanna squeeze your fingers. It's a bitch move. Shake your hand dude. Yeah, it's a bitch. Move. You

0 (3m 50s):
Like

2 (3m 50s):
A firm handshake. I like a man with a firm handshake. Look in the eye. Dead fish. I like a firm handshake, but I don't like that finger squeezing bullshit. 'cause that's cheating Oh. yeah, yeah, yeah. Agreed. Agreed. You know I don't have a good grip. You squeeze it anyway.

0 (4m 2s):
But you do

2 (4m 3s):
Bag move. Nice person would relax their hand. You position. There you go. And you give each other a nice firm handshake. That's right.

0 (4m 11s):
For sure. Even that, like when guys try to over, like they got a real strong grip and they try to fucking give you that squeeze. I just feel, especially my right hand. Like I got a fucking bump here from Sean. He caught his head and bump his, I had a hoof after I got done with that second fight, remember I shake my head and, and it's still like I start to double wrap it when I hit with Longo after a while. So when guys squeezed that shit, I feel like, all right dude. All right. You got me beat with the grip, but I'll fucking strangle the fuck outta whatcha trying to share? Whatcha trying to Oh?

2 (4m 37s):
Yeah.

0 (4m 37s):
Good. Do you do that gripping thing?

2 (4m 39s):
Fuck yourself. Well it's like men feel so uncomfortable when they're around a guy like you. They don't know how to behave. Can I grip some coffee?

0 (4m 46s):
Yeah. Yeah.

2 (4m 46s):
For you.

0 (4m 47s):
I'll do like a sneak and I. Do

2 (4m 48s):
You want the espresso or do you want a cup? There's a cup. 'cause

0 (4m 50s):
It's just, oh, that's a lot better. Yeah, I make a mess

2 (4m 53s):
Because like, You know when they get around a guy like you, they don't know what to do. They, we got, 'cause guys like always like to pretend that they could beat another guy's ass. Right. Even they're just posturing a little fuck duck guy up. They meet a guy like you all of a sudden they're like,

0 (5m 6s):
How are you? Well that's why, that's why I put on some weight. That's

2 (5m 10s):
Why I'm trying to get over 200 just so I can posture on them back. You know what

0 (5m 13s):
I'm, I understand.

2 (5m 14s):
I understand Flex A little bit. Like if you're meeting Francis Ino, how fucking terrifying is that? Oh. yeah, no doubt.

0 (5m 19s):
Like there's this, you're regular dude.

2 (5m 21s):
You're regular dude and you shake that guy's hand. You're like, oh, what the fuck man, I remember the first time I interviewed him, I was standing next to him. I'm like, what the fuck? Man, that guy is so powerful.

0 (5m 32s):
He, he's fighting a guy bigger than him.

2 (5m 35s):
Guy PE Fer. That guy is his first name. He is good. And he's, he's like six, he's eight. He cod Ryan Bader and real quick, right. It wasn't like, he like 20 seconds

0 (5m 46s):
Jack

2 (5m 47s):
Him or something. Yeah, it was real quick. Quick dude. Hit him with a clean right hand. Yeah, let's watch that. Because this guy's good dude. Like this is, I never seen him fight.

0 (5m 54s):
Dangerous fight. I just seen the size him after.

2 (5m 56s):
He's a a big motherfucker. You have to think You know he fights Anthony Joshua. That was a bad KO from one of the best knockout artists in boxing. Right? How tall is this?

0 (6m 5s):
This guy's big. He's really athletic too because he's a lot taller than

2 (6m 9s):
Super fast man. And he does a lot of wild shit. He throws a lot of kicks and knees. Dude, he's good. How much taller

0 (6m 16s):
Is he than

2 (6m 16s):
A a few inches. I think Francis is like, Francis is like 6, 6 4 or 6, 6 5. Is he something like that? This guy's, he's taller. Francis is bigger though for sure. But this guy's fucking dangerous man. And he's real long. Like watch this combination when he lands it on Bader. See Bader can't close the distance here. He's having a hard, this guy's from the outside son. Look at that right hand. He

0 (6m 40s):
Waited for him to throw that

2 (6m 42s):
Jab. Bro, watch that again. That shit was perfect. Watch that again. Look at the timing on this guy. Man. Watch this Bader's trying to close. He's trying to close. Check out this dude. Watch this fade away a little to his left. Boom.

0 (6m 54s):
Oh, I mean that's right over over the top of the jab. Right over the, that guy can do that. 10.

2 (6m 59s):
That guy's dangerous man. Yeah, he's fucking dangerous dude. His footwork was real, real nice.

0 (7m 5s):
That said is also 40 and you know a hundred

2 (7m 8s):
Percent. A hundred percent. But, but Bader had heavyweights been doing pretty good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Especially under them. Bellator testing.

0 (7m 16s):
What kind test that. Yeah, what testing? Yeah, that's a multiple choice test. What the fuck? But how, how

2 (7m 23s):
Many times did Bobby Lashley compete?

0 (7m 26s):
No

2 (7m 26s):
Disrespect to Bobby Lashley,

0 (7m 28s):
But still we know what's up. But he

2 (7m 30s):
Was always on an Indian reservation

0 (7m 31s):
Somewhere. He was No, no, no real

2 (7m 35s):
Commission bro. What a body though. Yeah,

0 (7m 36s):
He looked a body

2 (7m 37s):
College

0 (7m 38s):
Lash.

2 (7m 40s):
Bobby Lashey the only guy I've ever fought in MMA that looked like he could enter a bodybuilding competition the day of the fight. Yep. Mark Kirk and his prime too. But Bob

0 (7m 48s):
Er had

2 (7m 50s):
Street random

0 (7m 51s):
For sure. But we know he was like a WWE guy. He is. He he

2 (7m 58s):
He was. And he could man yo, he could fight. Was he like a D two national champ

0 (8m 3s):
Or something like that? As a wrestler? Yeah, he was, yeah. He was a real legit wrestl. He's a

2 (8m 7s):
Legit fighter. Legit fighter. But there ain't no way you touched him positive or

0 (8m 12s):
Negative. Yeah, because he wrestled it like 180 9 in college

2 (8m 15s):
Also. He's 48. Whoa. You know. Just, but look, I no disrespect guy. Looks fucking great. It's amazing. Some guys are natural, right? Like Paul Costa, he's just got the gene son

0 (8m 27s):
Is now. Is he natural? I I mean I guess maybe. What do you think? And he plays it up with the secret juice and I. It's easy. Love

2 (8m 35s):
That shit. You'll be talking that much shit if you really

0 (8m 37s):
No, but no, I

2 (8m 38s):
Think every, he always looks the same. He never tests positive. And the guy has crazy genetics like look how handsome he is. Look at that

0 (8m 44s):
Broad. That is true. That

2 (8m 45s):
Is true. The guy's got freak genetics just in looks and also in his build. He's been tested a billion times. A billion times. Yeah. Never tested

0 (8m 52s):
Motherfuckers have chemists out there. Hey, you used to work for American Top team. Tell us the

3 (8m 56s):
Secrets. Tell us the secrets that they got over in that fucking tell secret. It's secret. Secret. It's not a secret. I wanna know what the fuck happened. It happens over there. I'm not gonna Juliana Pena this one. I'm not. You getting paid by that. Oh God.

2 (9m 15s):
Oh

3 (9m 15s):
My God. By

0 (9m 16s):
The way, great work with Sean Brady by

4 (9m 17s):
The Oh. yeah. The way

3 (9m 18s):
Brady an animal

2 (9m 19s):
Man bro. He looked great. He looked great. Yeah

4 (9m 22s):
Man. He's a, he's a hardworking kid. He's young. I know. He was on this show before. He's young, hardworking, tough You know. He's on his way up

2 (9m 28s):
Bro. He's got a double size back.

3 (9m 31s):
He

2 (9m 31s):
Behind him his back. Like he looks like

3 (9m 32s):
He's got a turtle shell.

2 (9m 34s):
Yes. Like it's double size and

4 (9m 35s):
That and that's genetic. Like his father has that.

2 (9m 37s):
That's crazy. He's wild. Yes.

0 (9m 38s):
His fight the other night with Gilbert Burns was fucking smart man. It's impressive. 'cause he, because I, I even though he has really, really good wrestling, he knew not to shoot his wide trying to get him down and 'cause Gilbert's fucking, what I love about Gilbert and it happened in the Damian Maya fight is, is if he's getting out wrestled the second he hits his floor, the floor right into Juujitsu sweeps half guards. He's playing Juujitsu. They go to play back. He's back through his feet. Yeah.

3 (10m 4s):
It's really nice. Oh. yeah, it's amazing.

2 (10m 5s):
Gilbert's one of the very best ever on the ground in MMA. It's like we've just seen him in so many standup wars 'cause it's so fucking hard to get people to the ground. Right, right,

4 (10m 13s):
Right.

2 (10m 14s):
I love what you ultimately that that's where it becomes a problem. Right. It's just so hard to get a, a world class guy to the ground. Well,

4 (10m 20s):
I mean, so when hams out fucked Gilbert Hams out was on top for a second. Right. And

3 (10m 23s):
As soon as Gilbert started playing, she was just, who Hams out was like, get me the fuck outta here. He stood up. Great. Well yeah,

0 (10m 29s):
But that's what's so smart about Brady though, because he was, he was patient up against the cage and then he waited to the later rounds. He's the younger guy. He's, he's banking on his cardio. Then he started committing to those doubles and now he's got a better chance of getting more time on the top.

3 (10m 42s):
You

2 (10m 43s):
Like if you look at him in comparison to like, he doesn't have the same accolades as far as Juujitsu competitions as Gilbert does. But he's like world class. He straight up rapper.

4 (10m 54s):
He's for sure, for sure. He's, he really

2 (10m 55s):
Is definitely

0 (10m 56s):
Legit. Craig Jones, he'd Craig, it

2 (10m 58s):
Might been There was a special rules thing. Couldn't,

4 (10m 60s):
There were no leg. That was it. There were no leg loss. Which is

2 (11m 2s):
You know with Craig Jones. I mean,

4 (11m 4s):
That's a big part of his game. Yeah.

2 (11m 5s):
If you're gonna compete against that guy, you gotta let him use the whole game. Yeah. It's the whole game. And you don't say you can't use your best stuff.

4 (11m 10s):
And they were,

3 (11m 11s):
Yeah. I mean

0 (11m 12s):
It was funny.

3 (11m 13s):
It was pretty

4 (11m 14s):
Stale. But, but Brady can hang with anybody on the ground. Yeah. Like he's so strong. He can hang with anybody. And

2 (11m 18s):
And I firmly believe that Craig Nelson, Craig Jones rather, if Craig Jones got him in any kind of a position, like a heel hook, he would never rip his shit apart. Right.

4 (11m 28s):
Yeah, no doubt. No doubt.

2 (11m 29s):
There's no chance. Yeah, no doubt.

0 (11m 30s):
But I understand these You like the fighters, the the current fighters. I like look what happened to Cub Swanson. I, I, I'm all for these guys taking grappling matches, but I'm also for them taking it with certain rules because exactly that. Fuck. Exactly. Cub Wan.

2 (11m 43s):
I was trying to tell that to Khalil Roundtree. 'cause Khalil Roundtree before he got the title fight was in here Oh. yeah. And he was telling me he was gonna take a grappling match. I go think about Cub Swanson. Yeah. He blows his ACL out. He's, he's gone for nine, 10 months. Oh. And he's in the, in the thirties. He's

4 (11m 57s):
Already in his spirit. Yeah. That's a death sentence almost. Shit. It can

2 (11m 60s):
Mean he came back. You can come back. But it's so unnecessary. Yeah. I get you're a badass but you're also a professional athlete. Yeah. You can't be motorbike riding. Well, Ceroni did it. Like Cerone wants be the biggest headache for the U ffc. He's out there fucking riding bulls, jumping out.

4 (12m 16s):
I don't remember

2 (12m 17s):
Hims skis. I don't

0 (12m 18s):
Remember him getting pulling outta too many fights though. No,

2 (12m 21s):
I don't believe he ever did. I I, I don't remember a single fight. I mean there might have been one his whole career, but it had to, he had to have a broken fucking leg or

4 (12m 29s):
Something. He still, but he was still reckless as fuck. Like reckless. He still still out there doing dumb shit.

0 (12m 32s):
He's an adrenaline junkie man. Right.

2 (12m 34s):
Yeah.

5 (12m 34s):
He's a freak still out there doing it.

2 (12m 35s):
He's still out there doing it. Same reason,

0 (12m 37s):
Man. Why people stick around too long in the game. But that

2 (12m 39s):
Yeah. But that's also why he's so much fun to watch man. 'cause he, he genuinely didn't give a fuck, you know, in the early days of his career, man, he was very interesting 'cause he was a wild kickboxer that had a great triangle. Yeah,

4 (12m 50s):
Yeah, yeah.

2 (12m 50s):
So he finished off a lot of his early jujitsu fights. Good for sure. With

4 (12m 53s):
Juujitsu, right? Yeah. He was, he was good off his back. Nasty off his, he was off his back. So like guys would, would wanna take him down and then he'd throw up that triangle. He was like, oh fuck. I didn't

5 (13m 2s):
Expect that. His first fight with Benson Henderson was one of the sickest fights ever. He had Benson in a a hundred different submissions. Mm. And Benson got out all of them. It was, it was pretty sick. Several

2 (13m 13s):
Triangles more. Ben

5 (13m 13s):
Doesn't get enough love.

2 (13m 14s):
Benson doesn't get enough love.

5 (13m 15s):
Yeah. It was a great fight when they were in the WEC.

2 (13m 19s):
Damn dude. Do you think about all the fucking wars that a lot of people have forgot about

4 (13m 23s):
Oh? yeah.

0 (13m 24s):
I, because there's so many fights now. I know, right? Like it's not like when I was, when We were fighting back in the day it was, it was, it was far and few between.

5 (13m 31s):
Like It wasn was a event 'cause There was only a few a year. You know

0 (13m 33s):
Exactly.

2 (13m 33s):
Right. People forgot about Jose. All those beginnings. Man, bro, I didn't,

5 (13m 38s):
When he goes into WEC, was there anybody really better? He's

4 (13m 42s):
Complete,

5 (13m 43s):
Complete fight.

4 (13m 44s):
Yeah. He's for short of U-S-W-E-C fighter out there.

2 (13m 46s):
Well you can't look, you can't keep that pace. Whatever that pace is. When a guy is at the top of the food chain, you can't keep that pace up for very long.

5 (13m 54s):
Man. He kept it for 10 years.

2 (13m 55s):
I always say you have to look at a guy by where he was when he was at its best. Like if we're gonna do this, like who's the best guy ever. Everything. That's why I always throw BJ Penn in there. Yeah, me too.

4 (14m 4s):
Because

2 (14m 5s):
BJJ Penn and, and you fought him. Yeah. BJ Penn in his fucking prime was a demon and

4 (14m 9s):
He went through everybody too far. Jesus Christ. But, but when he was in his prime, it was like BJ and then everybody else. Yes. Yeah, for sure. But just,

2 (14m 18s):
You just can't keep that up forever. Yeah, for sure. So if you look at Aldo, like the Aldo that fought Uriah, remember what he did to Uriah's leg Jesus. And how tough is Uriah? How many dudes would've attacked? He took it. How many dudes would've just rolled over? And that would've been the end of

5 (14m 31s):
It. I think Aldo respected him and actually like backed off towards the end because of it. I think he did too. You know what I mean?

2 (14m 36s):
Like guy might have lost his leg. I mean almost got compartment syndrome. He had a He did. He had Right. He had to go in hyperbaric chamber every day to try to heal that fucking thing. Yeah.

4 (14m 44s):
Man. Full disclosure, like at the end of my career when I was fighting in 45, I was like, I'll fight anybody. But although I ain't fighting guy trying to get my leg kicked. Yeah. Like I ain't fighting that guy.

5 (14m 54s):
That's missing from him later. Was the, he You know the frequency of his leg kicks stopped? Yeah. You think it was just 'cause of injuries or

4 (15m 3s):
He started boxing a lot? Like he started, yeah, he started boxing. Is

0 (15m 6s):
He back now, by the way?

2 (15m 7s):
Back his back. He back. Yeah. I think you're fucking shins. Just go man. Yeah. I mean think about, that's what was going on with Amanda, right? She was having nerve damage in her shins.

4 (15m 16s):
Yeah. Shit.

2 (15m 17s):
Just think about, especially now with the calf kick, how many guys that fought Pejeta are gonna be fucked up for the rest of their life? You know how many guys are gonna have like some weird thing with their foot.

5 (15m 27s):
You're gonna get like foot or something from nerve damage.

0 (15m 30s):
Yeah. My biggest fear was that shin break, like what happened to Chris happened that even, even before it happened in the U ffc, I seen it in kickboxing and I'm like, yeah, like, you know,

2 (15m 40s):
It's horrible.

0 (15m 40s):
Like you gotta really, like you could trust your shins, but like could you, how do you know? How the fuck do you know You know? I mean, I don't know. I, it was always something in the back of my head when I was throwing kicks.

4 (15m 51s):
And it's so spontaneous too. Even when I'm watching fights now, like when it happens, I always like have this responsive be be ready to look away. Yeah. Because if a leg snap, I don't want to see that. Nobody

0 (16m 0s):
Wants to see that. Yeah.

2 (16m 2s):
You know it's interesting the way Peda does everything. 'cause he doesn't re I don't think he runs the risk as much of that because first of all, he kind of kicks around the outside of your leg. Always. Yeah. He never goes Hindu hin. Right. And even when he kicks the thigh, he's like kicking up. Yeah.

4 (16m 19s):
It's like an upward even on the back. Yeah, for sure. He always catches that back angle or an up kick

2 (16m 24s):
Until he wants to smoke You. like Yie. Yeah. Yeah. Like Yie came across and just smoked him. But it's not, it wasn't just about touching. He knew he already had 'em. He almost knocked him out at the end of the first. Exactly. He, he knew he had 'em. Yeah. But it's just his the, the power that he can generate from no hip at all. He's just slapping you.

5 (16m 42s):
Yeah. He don't have a big, he doesn't really have a tell. It just flicks it. It's crazy because you, it's

2 (16m 48s):
The perfect combination of a guy who has this insane God-given power. Like he's got insane one touch of death power. Yeah. Left hook and then the intelligence to not wind up.

0 (16m 59s):
It's

2 (16m 59s):
Kind of crazy. Yeah. He's just tapping you with it. Tapping you with it. But the thuds are so bad

4 (17m 5s):
And they're so, it's such a clean shot. Yeah. Yeah. It's a clean shot.

0 (17m 9s):
I think this is gonna be a, a wild take. I don't think it's gonna be a popular take. I think that Pere is gonna mix in a take down really? I think, I think

2 (17m 24s):
Against Khalil.

0 (17m 26s):
I don't know. Maybe I'm

3 (17m 27s):
Retarded. I think that's already been established

5 (17m 38s):
Already. It's already been a style

3 (17m 39s):
Out out. Yes.

0 (17m 41s):
He's, I I mean listen, he's, you don't get more confident on the feet than him, but he hangs out with our good friend, the great glove

4 (17m 49s):
Of TT. Yeah. And

0 (17m 50s):
You see him sparring. You see him mixing that shit in. Is he doing it for shits and giggles? Is he doing it to work his cardio? Maybe.

4 (17m 57s):
Or

0 (17m 58s):
He. could Be dealing with Khal Roundtree and say, You know what, let me show them. I

4 (18m 2s):
Mean that's, I saying

5 (18m 3s):
Give him a wrinkle just to give him something to think about.

2 (18m 6s):
Well he's gotta learn it. Right. And he is learning it. And why not just do that too? If, if he could just mix that in, how many more strikes would he land too? Because then if there's a real threat of him taking

4 (18m 16s):
You down Oh. yeah, for sure. Yeah. How many more?

2 (18m 18s):
And by the way, how fucking strong is that guy on the ground? Probably.

4 (18m 21s):
I know his hands are probably so big. He just, he's got, he's

5 (18m 25s):
Baseball mixing

4 (18m 27s):
That

2 (18m 27s):
Dude's made outta

4 (18m 28s):
Wood. Yeah. and I put

2 (18m 29s):
My hand on him to talk to him. He's made outta wood. What a kid. 85. Yeah.

4 (18m 34s):
What does the comma mean when he says comma? Oh, shama sha. What

2 (18m 37s):
Does that means? Everything. It means like fight means like fuck yeah. Shama means like shaa.

4 (18m 41s):
It's

2 (18m 42s):
Cool when he says it, when someone says like they wanna fight, he is like shamma and You like Shama. You don't wanna hear that from that team.

4 (18m 48s):
You'd rather hear him talk some shit than hear him sha he's got

2 (18m 53s):
The scariest walkout of all time.

4 (18m 55s):
You that little limp that he does arrow's good. And you're in that octagon

2 (19m 1s):
Waiting for him. And you see that stomp.

4 (19m 3s):
Hey,

2 (19m 5s):
Hey,

4 (19m 6s):
Think about, but think about his come up man. Like he had, he was able to come up this year without talking shit. Yeah. At all talking shit. Yeah. So like all these fighters think they gotta talk shit to come up. He did it by just stepping up to the plate doing that they fighting and knock him motherfuckers out. He

2 (19m 21s):
Doesn't even smile

4 (19m 24s):
Much less talk. I don't

5 (19m 25s):
Even smile. He leans into that Easter island thing too. He'll wear the chain with

4 (19m 28s):
The, with

2 (19m 30s):
Very seriously. He thought him and Jamal were gonna be cool with each other. And then Jamal started clowning him. Right. And he got angry. That was got really angry.

5 (19m 37s):
It was a mistake.

2 (19m 38s):
He don't want that guy angry. But Jamal like, did that fight like There was that weird moment where he, he kicked Jamal in the nuts. You know. Or Jamal kicked him in the nuts rather. Yeah. And he and he waved when he raped her dean off. Yeah. When he waved the red and he did a little step in

4 (19m 54s):
There. Yeah. Yeah. He got a little

2 (19m 55s):
Closer, right? He got in the kitchen.

4 (19m 57s):
Yeah. But Jamal, I talked to Jamal about that. Like Jamal called all of us on the broadcast. He was like, yo. And he was like, he stepped on and got the angle and I couldn't move 'cause Herb Dean was there and the defense there.

2 (20m 8s):
No, he's right. He's definitely right. Yeah. But we didn't see it. Right. I didn't, I didn't see that. All I was thinking is so there's so much happens. Right? A guy gets kicked in nuts. I'm like, oh shit. Are they gonna, is he hurt? First question is always, is this gonna fuck the fight up? Like how long is this gonna be? Okay? He's gotta take a break. Is he gonna be okay? Because I think like every time you get kicked in nuts, one point every time you get eye poked. One point. Because even if it's an accident, if you get slammed in your nuts and then you have to go back to fighting two minutes

4 (20m 35s):
Later,

5 (20m 36s):
I mean it's effect.

2 (20m 37s):
You've been affected.

4 (20m 38s):
Yeah, no doubt. Two

2 (20m 39s):
Minutes ago you couldn't

4 (20m 39s):
Even fight. Yeah, no doubt.

2 (20m 40s):
And now all of a sudden you're supposed to fight full clip against a guy who's trying to kill you. Who just cracked you in the nuts. Who's that? Is that you Dean?

4 (20m 49s):
Is that you Matt? Not me. That another, I'm a professional.

2 (20m 52s):
Who is it? I'm on airplane

4 (20m 53s):
Mode. Hold on, lemme see. I think it's Thomas. Is that you? It's Syphone, it's me. Oh it it's

2 (20m 59s):
Son of a bitch.

4 (21m 0s):
Hold minute. I gotta tell you a You

2 (21m 3s):

4 (21m 4s):

2 (21m 11s):

2 (21m 16s):
Oh you can do do not disturb. you know how to do that? No, I don't

4 (21m 19s):
Know how to do that. Okay,

2 (21m 19s):
Look, put it on airplane mode. Open your phone up and then scroll down. Like scroll down from the top and then you can get to airplane. No, I would

4 (21m 26s):
Rather just turn it off.

2 (21m 27s):
Don't get to do not disturb. Alright. Just turn it off

0 (21m 30s):
On the floor and stop on

4 (21m 30s):
It. You want me to start? See Yeah. Here, we go. I turned it off. Alright,

2 (21m 33s):
So Here we go We, were talking about Alex and Jamal. But so I would Here we go We didn't notice it. We didn't notice it because okay. He gets kicked in nuts. Like, oh shit, they stopping the fight. What's going on? How so? I didn't notice that little hop in. He had already did he

4 (21m 47s):
Already got closer? Yeah. You see now he got the foot on the outside.

2 (21m 50s):
Yep. Yeah. and I mean it's brilliant on his part. But on the

5 (21m 53s):
Flip side, herb wasn't in Jamal's way. He could definitely have

2 (21m 56s):
Moved. Right. But Jamal did relax. Look, he, he relaxed. He

4 (21m 59s):
Relaxed

2 (21m 60s):
His legs. He gave him the thumbs up. Are we cool? And it looked like he was trying to touch gloves. So they touch gloves. But he's already way closer than he is ever been before. Yeah, yeah,

4 (22m 8s):
Yeah. But

2 (22m 9s):
Wait, so most of the fight up until this point was fought with Jamal about a foot per past where they are right now. He was in the outside and he was touching him from the outside and that was his game plan. I talked to him on the phone about it. He was explaining to me his game plan. Everything was going great. Who Jamal?

4 (22m 24s):
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. He, he had a point.

2 (22m 26s):
He's keeping the, he had a fucking real

4 (22m 27s):
Fight. Did he call you too? Yeah. Yeah. I called him. I was gonna say he called like

2 (22m 32s):
We, but he's right 'cause we didn't notice it. But this, this is one of those moments where you're like, I stopping the fight. No. Okay. They not stop of the fight. Like I didn't realize any made that right. That little, that little hop hop

4 (22m 42s):
He does.

2 (22m 42s):
Yeah. That little hop hop is legit dude. It's, it's a, it's a such a good move. Watch it now. Let's see. Watch. So Herb moves to him, he's gonna stop the fight. He puts his hand up. Watch this. He touches him.

4 (22m 55s):
Nope.

2 (22m 56s):
But look how close he is now. Yeah. See how close he is now? Yeah, sure.

4 (22m 59s):
Yeah.

2 (22m 60s):
He's a lot closer. Back it up. Back it up. So back it up before the nut shot. Now look at the distance. Now see the distance. Big difference. Big

0 (23m 7s):
Difference. But Jamal does fire off first though. Doesn't he watch he did after he gets kicked.

2 (23m 12s):
Yeah. Probably. Let's

0 (23m 13s):
Say, I mean, who throws the first punch? Jamal throws it first though, I think. Does he? Let's see,

2 (23m 17s):
Let's see. He might

0 (23m 17s):
Be right. He might be. He's getting in corner. Look at Jamal already. Jamal throw. Nope. They throw at the same time. They'll throw at the same time.

2 (23m 22s):
He did

4 (23m 22s):
Throw.

2 (23m 23s):
But also look Alex too, obviously Alex is coming in,

4 (23m 25s):
But he also put his hand on the outside of Jamal's hand that cleared the angle for him to throw the left hook over top of it.

2 (23m 31s):
And dude, his left hook that it's like a shovel hook.

4 (23m 34s):
Half

2 (23m 35s):
A upper cut, half a hook. And it's just perfect. Perfect.

0 (23m 39s):
Alright. Maybe he won't shoot on kil. No, I'm only kidding.

4 (23m 43s):
Kils

2 (23m 43s):
Ding. Remember when Khalil knocked out? Go Kasa

4 (23m 45s):
Man. Dude.

2 (23m 46s):
Dude. He's fucking

4 (23m 48s):
Dangerous. Yeah, I know Khalil. He's dangerous. Not that my boy Anthony Smith had him in slow motion. I was like, damn

0 (23m 53s):
That

2 (23m 54s):
Off speed uppercut he threw, that was slick dude. He's fucking terrifying. He was like,

4 (23m 58s):
Khalil's

5 (23m 59s):
On. Oh, Khalil.

2 (23m 60s):
Khalil Roundtree. Fucking he came, he came,

5 (24m 2s):
Came back from Thailand like a different fighter. Once. I think once he went over there like, and was training full time, like There was a, I mean There was a big change in him. I thought, well

2 (24m 10s):
Khalil's like had moments in his career where he hasn't been dialed in. you know, There was a few fights where he admittedly like wasn't all in and now he's all in. Like now he's like super focused like the Anthony Smith fight. You like, oh shit. Like that's a dangerous contender. I mean,

5 (24m 25s):
We're gonna find out. But

4 (24m 26s):
Do you think find out, do you think the U Ffc would want Khalil to be champ? you know what I'm saying? Because why not? He just, well he just don't really have like that championship thing about him where like you go, oh that's my champ right there. Like he don't really have that. I mean I think

2 (24m 39s):
Yeah, but nobody does until they do. Or Olivera didn't have it until he got it right. Olivea was the guy that everybody was beating. Man. That's true. So many guys from Paul

4 (24m 47s):
Felder fucked him up for a lot of guys

2 (24m 49s):
For sure. Of Cub Swanson knocked him out for sure. A lot of guys would beat Olivea 'cause he was cutting too much fucking weight. Right. And he just didn't have any energy. But I'm just saying like every time

0 (24m 56s):
You see

4 (24m 57s):
Kao Roundtree do interviews, he crying and stuff like that. Like is that the type of guy

0 (25m 0s):
Like that we really want? Is he crying?

4 (25m 4s):
He all, he's

0 (25m 5s):
Sensitive. You don't Thomas,

2 (25m 6s):
He's a sensitive guy. You don't

4 (25m 7s):
Cry You. know what I'm saying? Sometimes the whole you car, there

2 (25m 10s):
Is nothing wrong with someone who's sensitive who could fuck you up. No, there's nothing

0 (25m 14s):
I'm not, I'm not saying there's,

4 (25m 15s):
I'm not saying there's something wrong, but I'm just saying, is that the guy that we want holding the

2 (25m 19s):
Belt? Maybe that's what we need in 2024 to get

0 (25m 21s):
More people fighting. Yeah. As you guys get older, do you get more emotional? Do you find yourself I'm

4 (25m 26s):
Emotional, I'm an emotional guy. I don't see that I'm an emotional. You want me

0 (25m 31s):
Guys? You guys don't get a little emotional. Let people more toxic. Let's talk.

2 (25m 36s):
We just, we just, we're not toxic. We just don't have a filter. Yes. This is just what actual men are like exactly's when no one around when you're bullshit. You like your boys. Yeah. When there's no one around that can yell at you. Yeah. you know, if we had the same conversation with our wives here, you'd be like, what the fuck are you saying?

0 (25m 52s):
Like,

2 (25m 53s):
Are you thinking that in the fucking air It

0 (25m 55s):
Would be a lot of that. Right?

4 (25m 57s):
True. True. And it's

2 (25m 58s):
Like, this is what people would be talking about if you were hanging out in your living room. It's, it's true. Four, four buddies hanging out in your living room. How would you talk? This is it

4 (26m 6s):
For sure. Just

2 (26m 7s):
Do it in front of the world.

0 (26m 8s):
Fuck it in. In that case, I don't cry at all. Yeah. I You pussies. That's I cried the other night. I was just gonna see if you do

2 (26m 15s):
Watching Chimp. Crazy. What? There's a show. Oh my God. There's a HBO show. What's Max now? Whatever it is, it's a docuseries about people that own chimpanzees. Oh dude.

5 (26m 25s):
It's that can't n Well wait, wait,

0 (26m 27s):
Hold on. What made you cry about that?

2 (26m 28s):
It's horrific, man. Oh wait,

0 (26m 30s):
Wait. With this it went bad.

2 (26m 32s):
When the chimps tear people apart. Tear. Oh that tear. What? They tear your face off. I know.

4 (26m 35s):
Tear your,

2 (26m 36s):
Bite your eyes off face. They bite your fingers off. Oh, they pull your dick off. Dude, it was, there's so many moments in that show where you're just like, what the fuck? It just, it's so sad. Oh, is there anything happy

0 (26m 47s):
In it or No,

2 (26m 48s):
It's no, no, no, no. There's nothing happy in this show. There's nothing happy in this show. This show is all about what happens when people have pet chimps. And the chimps get to be about five years old and they don't want to listen to you anymore because they're a 200 pound fucking super predator. For real. They can do whatever they want. Like what they are. They're our closest relatives and they're really fucking smart. And when they get to be like five years old, you can't even put 'em in a combination lock. They were telling me because they'll figure out the combination. They'll watch you do it. That's, oh shit. And then they'll do it. They'll see what you do to get out and then they'll replicate, get, so this is real. Get real Planet of the Apes type shit. They're really smart, man. They just can't talk. They're not as smart as people.

2 (27m 28s):
But they also, they're vindictive and spiteful and they're angry and jealous

0 (27m 32s):
Fighters. They do that a lot with the, the wild animals. Like the fucking people own hippos. The

2 (27m 36s):
Thing about when they hit like five, you just gotta keep him in cages all the time. So when they're babies, everybody's hanging around with them. You can bring him to the pizza place. Oh my God. It's the lady with the chimpanzee. But then they get to be five and then they rip someone's face off for no fucking reason at all.

5 (27m 53s):
What was the, the Netflix series that

2 (27m 57s):
Followed the chips Oh. yeah. Chimp. Chimp Empire.

5 (27m 58s):
That's what I thought. Chimp Empire in Incredible. That was a crazy crazy show. That one was incredible crazy show

2 (28m 3s):
Because that one, these scientists were embedded in this, this group of chimpanzees for 20 years. So these people, these chimpanzees their whole lives, they had seen scientists, they had these rules. You have to stay 20 yards away. Don't look 'em in the eye. No food. You can't have any food anywhere near them. So as long as fucking the gremlins with the fall man, they're just chimpanzees. If they decide you have something,

5 (28m 22s):
You gotta see this.

2 (28m 23s):
If they decide that you have something they want, there ain't shit you can do about that. Like,

5 (28m 27s):
Like they, they were, they were fighting

2 (28m 28s):
Shit you

5 (28m 29s):
Can do over territory. I mean you, you got to see the hierarchy within You know their clans or whatever you wanna call it is, it's a badass. And

2 (28m 37s):
The guy told me

5 (28m 37s):
If you had the guy on your show, right? Yeah.

2 (28m 39s):
Yeah. The guy was the who produced it.

5 (28m 40s):
That's how I

2 (28m 40s):
Heard it. The show's so good. Dude, it's, this is much better than Chimp. Crazy. This is like the opposite of Chimp. Crazy. Yeah.

5 (28m 46s):
This is real shit.

2 (28m 47s):
Chimp crazy is sad. But this is amazing. It's amazing 'cause they, they, these chimps are so accustomed to these scientists that they acted completely normal around them. Like they were just a part of the of nature to them. Mm. Because their whole life they had had scientists around it with cameras. Yeah, right. It was just a thing in the forest. It was just like, that's a different kind of tree or something. As long as you don't have food, if you long, you don't look 'em in the eye and don't get any closer than 20 yards. Damn. Those are the rules. So if the chimps start moving towards you, you move away. You gotta move back. Don't look 'em in the eye. You look away. Don't have any fucking food. if you got a candy bar, they'll rip your dick off for that candy bar. They don't have any sense of what's appropriate.

2 (29m 29s):
They don't, You know there's no remorse. They bite each other's hands off. Oh my God bro. They're ruthless. And that's our closest relative. So You

0 (29m 37s):
Know what you do. You just get a dog. You don't get a, you don't get a fuck in and you're not, it's not DJ in the bear type shit. Get fuck outta here.

2 (29m 46s):
All

0 (29m 47s):
Who needs that chimp? Who needs that shit? That's

2 (29m 50s):
Awesome. Nobody needs that shit. All that shit. You see in, in those movies though, those are all young chimps. You can't even train them when they get older. They're not listening to nothing.

0 (29m 58s):
Ooh,

2 (29m 59s):
There's no listening. I gotta watch

0 (30m 0s):
This. You remember that? Clean this wood movie. Fucking any which way but loose is awesome. I used to love those movies

5 (30m 5s):
And any which way you can

2 (30m 7s):
Of them.

0 (30m 7s):
The second one when they

5 (30m 8s):
That fight

0 (30m 10s):
And the next, you know, they heard they're still fighting. And then next, you know the guys, they're on different, oh, let's get on the plane and let's go see the fight. Dude, they're fighting for fucking two hours. These guys in the warehouse,

5 (30m 19s):
Like across the state

2 (30m 20s):
And the, who was that guy's name? Tank Murdoch. That guy

5 (30m 23s):
In the first one. Yeah.

0 (30m 24s):
Became friends.

5 (30m 24s):
I remember all that shit. Philo. Beto

Name. Yeah. Philo. Beto. Yeah. Yeah. And they had the right

5 (30m 29s):
Turn. Right turn. Clyde.

2 (30m 31s):
You know it's funny because back then you would never think that people were actually having bare knuckle fights for money. And now it's on pay-per-view. Oh. yeah,

0 (30m 39s):
I know, right? That dude You like Mike Barry

2 (30m 43s):
There was never gonna be bare knuckle boxing.

0 (30m 46s):
I'll tell you man. Man.

2 (30m 47s):
As a sport. That's crazy. So this is just some backyard shit that people would do. Like this is the, this is the big killer. This is the guy that's like the, the big money champion. He's gonna eventually fight him and he's watching Clint and he steps in to help him and he starts fucking some people up.

0 (31m 3s):
We didn't even know what was Yeah, this was awesome. We didn't even know what real fighting was back then. I had

2 (31m 7s):
No idea. Somebody needs to redo. Well all those things he did would work. I mean, it's not crazy. He's not doing any like jump split kicks.

0 (31m 15s):
I used to like these movies as a kid. I loved,

5 (31m 16s):
Loved, oh these movies

Which one? Unforgiven or

2 (31m 37s):
Imia? Huckleberry. Yeah. I, when he is looking he is like I'm,

0 (31m 41s):
Anytime you get Kurt and I and I, we did this in a Kurt Russell text. Kurt, we talked, we talked about Bone Tomahawk. That's right. Oh. yeah. Now this is, I find these movies I never heard about. It came out in like 2015. Yeah. and I saw it on Netflix. I thought it was new and I didn't know. So I started watching it. Holy fuck What? You see a good one? Yeah. It's like a western horror

5 (32m 4s):
Horror movie. Yeah.

0 (32m 4s):
Because these cannibal Indians are almost like predators. 'cause they got these things. Well

He can make like a multiple of himself. Like other Yeah, yeah. Like clones of himself. Yep. Alright. Now I'm, listen, I'm not a prude. Okay. I could deal with some sex scenes and some, some freaky shit. That one. But my thing is this, there's a scene now. They go, now this, I don't need to see a guy's face in another guy's asshole. Even if it's his own body. So multiple man or this, this little like, like version of him in his team. He, he's not lying, he, they go into a sauna. Right. and I guess this happens sometimes in, in, in gay gyms.

0 (35m 2s):
It's

2 (35m 2s):
Like an man turned full size and he blew the guy apart. Yeah. That's

0 (35m 4s):
Like ant man inside someone's asshole.

2 (35m 7s):
Yeah. This is not necessary. Yeah dude.

0 (35m 9s):
That's what I'm saying. But picture

This kind

0 (35m 11s):
Of crazy though. Picture. You ever see human centipede?

2 (35m 12s):

2 (35m 14s):
Crazy way to die. I wanna see him explode. So what happens, does he just decide to get bigger?

5 (35m 19s):
I think he sneezes in it. Oh

2 (35m 20s):
He sneeze. Oh he nee

5 (35m 21s):
Fucks up his, I guess his ability to control it.

2 (35m 25s):
Oh my gosh. Oh. Yeah.

4 (35m 26s):
But the whole show is like this where they

2 (35m 28s):
Do shit like that. So crazy.

0 (35m 29s):
There's some good stuff in the show. Yeah. That's

2 (35m 31s):
Gross.

5 (35m 32s):
The first few seasons was cool this past season. They stopped Woke on on

0 (35m 36s):
Dude. Yeah.

2 (35m 37s):
I'm trying to explain that to the cops.

0 (35m 39s):
And then, and then, and then multiple man, he's got pink eye 'cause he had his, he had his face and an asshole. So now he's coming back. He's got a pink eye.

2 (35m 49s):
100%. Someone's trying to normalize things like that. Yeah.

0 (35m 52s):
Like

2 (35m 52s):
That's probably like every bottom's dream to actually climb inside a guy's asshole. Ugh. I just wanted to be inside

0 (35m 58s):
Of you. You know. Just where they just, just get all up in there. But Matt, I know, I know exactly the scene you're talking about right out. Yeah, I know.

2 (36m 7s):
That's unnecessary. I would tap out after that. Yeah. I tapped out on the Walking Dead when they killed Glen with the baseball bat. Yeah. In,

0 (36m 14s):
Yeah. Yeah. Me too. Me too. You know what's fucked up though. They actually did that in the comic book.

2 (36m 19s):
Oh, I'm sure they did.

0 (36m 20s):
Did

2 (36m 21s):
Didn't have to show it to me like that.

0 (36m 22s):
Yeah, because we, we murder

2 (36m 24s):
Murder porn. That's murder porn. I loved Glen. I saw Glen at the U Ffc and he looked sad. He looks killed

0 (36m 30s):
Him off fucking. But you imagine

2 (36m 32s):
That like that's your character. Your character for all these years. Everybody loves it. That's how you go out. Then they kill 'em off with a baseball bat and you're like, and then you no more. No more show. Bye. Yeah, yeah. Bye. We're done with you. The

0 (36m 41s):
Show You like what the fuck? What's less flag anyway with that shit? Well it's, you can't

2 (36m 46s):
Keep doing that. Oh the people are the monsters. You can't keep doing that forever. It gets bored. Figure it out. Find out who the cunts are. Kill 'em. Let better community

0 (36m 54s):
Shows jump. Shit. Stupid too. You know like fucking Cobra Kai and I like that first season Also how,

2 (36m 59s):
Why they're still zombies. They, they walk two miles an hour. You haven't killed

0 (37m 2s):
Yet. I kai yet. How hard, hard is this to figure out how to kill these things? And they, they're so easy. Slow

2 (37m 6s):
As fuck. you know all you need is that lady with the sword and just like every day run out. Kill 30 of

0 (37m 11s):
Them eventually. Yeah. Nobody's gonna be left. This is crazy

2 (37m 15s):
That they still run into zombies. Gee, you haven't killed all the zombies in like five years.

0 (37m 20s):
That show. Yeah, that lawsuit. I agree. Yeah. and I think There was a spinoff with Darryl Dixon. I didn't even watch.

2 (37m 25s):
There's a bunch of spinoffs. There's the LA one too. The LA spinoff too. It pretty good. It was Fear of The Walking Dead. Yeah. Oh. yeah. Yeah. That might have been the best one. Really? Yeah, it was really good. Especially in the beginning it was really good because it was like no one knows what the fuck is going on. But it gave You like a real sense of like dread and fear. Like these people are trapped in the middle of this outbreak and the middle military moves in and no one gives anybody any answers. Which is really how It would go. Right? Yeah. That's the LA one. Fear of the Walking Dead is much more realistic. Like this is how It would go. Like the guy waking up in the hospital in the Walking Dead. The problem with that scene is 28 days later, that's how it starts.

0 (38m 5s):
Yeah. Same

2 (38m 6s):
Exact scene. 28 days later, Killian Murphy also from Peaky Blinders. Right? He's in the hospital and he wakes up. He doesn't know what the fuck happened 'cause he got hit by a car or something like that. Right. That

0 (38m 17s):
On was a great movie by

2 (38m 18s):
The way. Was he riding a bike? Got hit by a car? I think. So he wakes up, he has no idea what the fuck's going on. And then in getting out of the hospital, he realizes that the world has ended and there's a zombie epoxys broken out while he was in a coma. It's the same as that. So

0 (38m 31s):
They just stole the whole thing. Well somebody stole. Well what came out first? The comic book or the

2 (38m 35s):
Fucking, that's a very good question. It's a very good question. What year did the Walking Dead graphic novel come out? That's a legit question there man. It's a real legit

0 (38m 43s):
Question. Thanks guys. Other thing, do

2 (38m 44s):
You know those movies? You can't find them on streaming. You can't find 28 days later on streaming out with

0 (38m 50s):
I've never seen it. That's why don't,

2 (38m 52s):
I think you can find 28 weeks later, but 28 days later, I don't think you can find, I think interesting. You have to 'cause I just bought it. I ordered it on DVDI bought a DVD and I felt,

0 (39m 4s):
You know what you ordered? You bought, how do, do you even have a DVD plan? I do. How fuck

2 (39m 7s):
Do you have a D VD player? Because they asked me if I wanted one and I said, yeah, I'll take one of them. and I haven't used it ever. I've been in this house for four years. I never used that fucking DVD player. But I'm gonna use it. They're gonna get, you still get blue rates get broken into. Especially they look really good. Like blue blueberry, like high resolution. Yeah. Those DVDs. Look, fuck, it's probably as good or better than streaming.

0 (39m 30s):
But I, I just don't know anybody with a DVD player. That's like VHS. I don't have that. Oh,

2 (39m 35s):
I had that for a long time though. Yeah. 'cause I used to get all the Pride videos on vhs. Right. I used to get like K one videos, K one Pride, all the weird shit from Japan from a friend of mine who would send it all in VHS When, what year was the graphic novel?

6 (39m 47s):
I saw a Reddit discussion that they both, so for the record on what? To answer your question, the Walking Dead came out within the same year that the movie came out. But someone noted that they both were taking from another movie that came out in the sixties.

2 (40m 1s):
Oh, what was that movie? The

6 (40m 2s):
Day of the TRTs

0 (40m 4s):
Woo. Day of the TRTs.

2 (40m 6s):
That's movie too.

0 (40m 7s):
That's on my next You know.

2 (40m 8s):
I was trying to look it up when you were asking. It's just, is that a monster movie or a zombie movie?

6 (40m 11s):
It's like zombies or something like that.

0 (40m 14s):
Oh, look at this

2 (40m 15s):
Ofid. What the fuck? What

6 (40m 17s):
Is a change after being splashed with TRD Poison from a Stinger during

2 (40m 21s):
His recovery, he is told of an unexpected green meteor shower. What? Yeah, that's some 1976 shit

6 (40m 28s):
For the record. I guess 28 days later may have, or sorry, walking Dead may have taken from. Mm, interesting.

2 (40m 34s):
Yeah, it's, well, 28 days later was a lot earlier. Right. What, what year did 28 days later come out? That's

6 (40m 42s):
What I was saying. They, they came out, it says the comics came out less than a year after. 28 days later was first in cinemas Oh. yeah.

2 (40m 48s):
So 28 days later was first

0 (40m 51s):
This guy just got into Game of Thrones like 20 years later. Yeah. and I just got into the game. I go, dude, the fucking thing been out. Like I, well I I know I didn't, I never had Max. I just got Max just so I could watch that shit. So. And the season, season two, dude.

2 (41m 4s):
It's good.

0 (41m 5s):
Oh. yeah, it's good. It's good. I ain't gonna lie. It is good. It's real good shit. I liked it so much. I told Dean after the first season, I didn't wanna wait till the second season. So I, I got the book and I ended up reading all five books and I don five books. I didn't even did that good. Oh. Oh it's fucking great. It's, and I loved it so much. I, I did it on my iPad and because of my a DDI made the, the font real big. So it's like two paragraphs. I'm like, eh, I'm going right through the, so otherwise I'll start looking at a squirrel album on the real, I didn't, I didn't even know Matt Reed and shit. you know, I started with comic books. Yeah. Here it's, but I loved it so much that I just

2 (41m 42s):
Why, sorry. So Wise has 28 days later been removed from streaming. It says indeed Disney lost the rights to the independently financed original film with them now only owning the rights to Searchlight Finance sequel 28 weeks later. So, well who the fuck owns it? So

6 (41m 56s):
Whoever made

2 (41m 56s):
It, I guess and they would, they don't want to put it on Netflix. Why wouldn't they? That's up them this, it's one of the best zombie movies of all time. Not

0 (42m 3s):
The best. It's, it's great. 'cause it's when they weren't slow, they get rabid. They were the scariest.

6 (42m 8s):
It could be one of those V VPN things. It could be another country and maybe you sneak around and

2 (42m 12s):
Maybe, right. maybe that

0 (42m 14s):
Was a great movie and they're coming. They're coming out with 28 years later. You know. No, for real. Yeah, they are. Yeah.

2 (42m 19s):
Yeah. Is there anybody left? Yeah,

0 (42m 21s):
I think that guy, the Peaky volley the guy what left,

2 (42m 24s):
What kinda life is that? What kind of life is it? Like if they, if some fucking Wuhan China lab comes up with some zombie virus and releases

0 (42m 33s):
It, nothing else

2 (42m 34s):
Surprising. That sounds crazy. But rabies is real.

0 (42m 37s):
Yeah,

2 (42m 37s):
That's exactly what rabies is.

0 (42m 39s):
It's cjo. Rabies

2 (42m 40s):
Takes animals that are not that, that never wanna bite people and turns 'em into an animal that needs to bite you. They run at you. They're not scared of you. Rats will run at you at foxes. They run at you when they have rabies. Yo,

0 (42m 54s):
I never thought about that. Yeah. Like rabies is just zombies.

2 (42m 57s):
It is zombie. 'cause it kills people before we figured out how to stop it. Like, and you have to get, you get some crazy shots in the stomach or something. Yeah. Get those shots before you start having symptoms. Like what they, they have to find out you got bit and then give you those shots and it has to happen really quickly. 'cause if you don't, it kills most people. Jesus. What RABs the disease kill something like 99% of the people that get it. What? Yeah, it's an old disease. And so one of the things they figured out is that if they slow down everything in your body and put you into a medically induced coma, it gives your body the resources to fight it off. 'cause your body can fight it off, but it can't fight it off as quick as the virus moves forward.

2 (43m 38s):
Mm. It's a cr it's an old virus man. It's an old, it's a weird,

0 (43m 43s):
Yo. That's crazy.

2 (43m 45s):
So, like, when you think about what that is, it's a crazy old virus that spreads itself by making its host violent. It is rage. It's, it's that So, so saying that no one would ever do this, these fucking psychopath eggheads, that they give these grants to do this fucking, this gain of function research shit on viruses, making them more infectious to human beings. Do you think they would stop at a, a coronavirus? Why wouldn't they fuck with rabies?

0 (44m 15s):
You know fights don't think they have rabies Moab because he does. you know, and

2 (44m 26s):
I used to say that about Liam Harrison.

0 (44m 28s):
And, and You know people are making a big thing about, oh, he's gotta get him down. He's gotta get him down. He didn't get ho. Well, listen, he gets him down. He's in trouble. Sugar Sean. But look what he did to Jose Aldo. He didn't get him down too much. No. And put him up against the cage that all that height. This the, the, the, the difference in height, the, the, the reach that's at a disadvantage once he gets a hold of him. Mm. So he could beat the shit out of him up against the cage. He doesn't get him down for a round. Now there's a little less his, a little less pop in Sean's in fucking his, in his, in his punches and strikes that, that, that that length is gonna be a problem when he closes the distance. Maah. So

4 (45m 5s):
I gotta ask you, because You know Maah better than anybody here, I'm sure. Yes. And from that, like, when I see him now, like he's just a different animal. Different animal. Yeah. Like a complete different character. Has he always been like this type of character, like making jokes and always been funny? And

0 (45m 21s):
When he first came to us, the English wasn't great at all. I mean, his, it's, it's not what it is now. He's always been a sweetheart. Just a sweetheart. But that's what I

5 (45m 30s):
Thought of him. Yeah. Imagine having Matt and Ray Longo as your English teachers.

0 (45m 35s):
Oh no. He's funny. Oh my God. He's always been funny. Come

4 (45m 42s):
On.

5 (45m 43s):

0 (46m 51s):
And I watched it again with my wife before I did the show, just to back in my head. 'cause I knew it was gonna be on the list. and I wondered why so many people didn't see this movie. So fucking the great Ray Longo brought up a a great point. It came out the opening weekend as good. Same as Goodfellas. Oh, same opening weekend. That's why it was fucking under the radar. You never seen it? I never seen. How dare you. I

4 (47m 12s):
Never even heard of it until you just said it right now. It like

2 (47m 21s):
One to remember. That's a good one to remember. I forgot about that.

0 (47m 23s):
State of Grace is great. Another one on the list that a lot of pe some a lot of people seen in this 'cause Picky Smalls Raps about him is the king of New York.

2 (47m 35s):
But lemme ask you this. Does heat Count, is that a mob movie? You

0 (47m 39s):
Know what I was thinking about putting it in there, but I didn't. It's

5 (47m 41s):
More, I it's more of

2 (47m 42s):
A heist movement. It's a heist movie, but it's organized crime. It is. Yeah.

0 (47m 45s):
It is the

2 (47m 46s):
Guy who got out jail. The the, it's based on a real dude. The guy who was the De Niro character who got outta jail. It was based on a real dude. Is he really? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. He did a bunch of robberies and then he went to jail for a long ass time and got out and did a bunch more robberies.

5 (47m 59s):
Was he a mob dude?

2 (48m 1s):
I don't, he was organized crime for sure. But it's like, who was he connected to? Was he connected to the Mafia? Was he independent, organized crime. But he was like super sophisticated.

5 (48m 10s):
It was a fantastic movie.

0 (48m 12s):
Phenomenal movie. But does American Gangster count?

2 (48m 15s):
Right?

0 (48m 15s):
That probably does by the way,

2 (48m 19s):
Also in the title it says gangster. Yeah, that's what I'm

0 (48m 21s):
Saying. Mentions

The Heat, the movie, the The Heat. A funny thing about Al Pacino in that movie, he's over the top of it. you know, she's got a great given

5 (48m 43s):
Sunday

0 (48m 44s):
When I seen him, he, he, they, he spoke about his role in that and he goes, what they didn't, when he goes, what influenced him about playing that character is that he was, the character was chipping off pieces of cocaine. Like he was like a cokehead and they kind of took that out of the movie, but that's how he was playing. Ah. Like all coked up. Interesting. So that kind of, it kind of explains it like how he was so like does does out his mind.

2 (49m 6s):
So they didn't show it in the movie, but that was how it was written.

0 (49m 8s):
He said it, it was Yes. That his, he had, he was like a chipping off piece of cocaine. Did they

2 (49m 14s):
Edit that out in the movie? I have no clue.

0 (49m 16s):
But he definitely said it in an interview.

2 (49m 17s):
Was it in the movie?

5 (49m 19s):
I don't believe so.

0 (49m 19s):
They did not have him do it in the movie. That's why when

2 (49m 21s):
He imagine you're doing that, you're doing this all coked up character and he's doing coke and then they cut out all

0 (49m 26s):
The coke down. He, they're like, everybody's like, what the fuck's wrong with him? He said that

5 (49m 29s):
You're playing a drunk. You

0 (49m 30s):
We were gonna remove the alcohol. It made perfect sense though. Once he said it, I Oh that. He goes, he goes. That's why, you know, I chose some of the, the choices I made for that character. You know.

2 (49m 39s):
If There was no meth, what, how much less crime would there be? Oh, five, 50%.

0 (49m 43s):
Yeah, for sure. I mean, if you think about how

2 (49m 47s):
Many ridiculous crimes get cooked up while they're on meth. Literally.

5 (49m 51s):
Or to get the meth. Yeah. Right.

0 (49m 53s):
Yeah, yeah. To get, yeah. Meth influence.

2 (49m 55s):
Do you remember that North Hollywood Shootout? It was just like the movie Heat.

0 (49m 59s):
Oh yes. They were body armor. These

2 (50m 2s):
Dudes had body armor. They had like fucking big giant machine guns and shit. It was Oh. yeah.

5 (50m 7s):
They were literally just walking up the street blasting people.

2 (50m 10s):
Apparently they were roed out of their fucking minds. These dudes roed out of their minds doing coke and they robbed this bank in North Hollywood and the cops boxed him in. They had a shootout on the street.

0 (50m 21s):
Oh. yeah. I was,

2 (50m 22s):
I was on news radio at the time. We stopped production of the show to watch it on television. Really? everybody was like, what the fuck is going on? It was so crazy.

5 (50m 31s):
How far from you was it

2 (50m 33s):
Real close? Yeah, real close. Like we We, were in Studio City North. Hollywood's 15 minutes away, 10 minutes away. Mm. Real close DA in the middle of street shit. The footage. Yeah. It's crazy.

5 (50m 44s):
Yeah. The news footage is the

2 (50m 45s):
Footage is crazy. And here's what's crazy. One of the cops shot one of the dudes and then did not call for ambulance. Did not. And, and then people were criticizing him that he let the guy bleed out.

7 (50m 56s):
Damn.

2 (50m 57s):
Yeah. I remember these fucking crazy liberals. They were criticizing him because this psychopathic murderer who just robbed a bank who was gunning down cops because he let 'em bleed out and didn't get 'em to an ambulance in time. Shit. Like, yo. Exactly. I think we, I think we know that guy's guilty. Yeah. Okay. This cgi, I in 1996,

5 (51m 17s):
Save the Taxpayers some money.

2 (51m 18s):
Maybe if you could find that Jamie. 'cause it's crazy to watch, man. It was trying to find the best footage on it in the middle of the street. Dude. I know. In the middle. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So these guys were having a shootout with these guy's walking down the street. Damn movie. Just blasting. Looked like a movie. Yeah, like a fucking movie.

5 (51m 33s):
It did look like a movie

2 (51m 34s):
Shooting at cops, dude. And this is just one part of it. Sometimes he was ducking behind cars with giant rifles and shit. I mean, they were just armed to the tits. Oh, they got him there. This is him at the end. So I think at the end he's probably trying to die. It's

5 (51m 47s):
A pretty long scene too. Like to the real. Yeah. When the real shit went down.

2 (51m 51s):
I forgot how it ends. Oh, we got him with another shot set. Keeps going. 'cause then the other guy comes. So he's trying to die. What's this guy doing? He's probably already been shot. This

7 (51m 58s):
Guy's doing little GTA action now.

2 (52m 2s):
This, it went on for a long ass time too. And this was back when if something happened, they would, we interrupt General Hospital to show you the Hollywood Shootout. Hollywood Shootout, bro. This is in the caveman days. I lived in the caveman days. Yeah. What year was this? This is like 90, 97. 87. 97. Oh, 97. Yeah. Really? Oh, I thought it was, see, I don't even remember this. Yeah, I remember it big time. Yeah,

5 (52m 25s):
I do too.

2 (52m 25s):
Because It was crazy because I have a friend, my friend Justin, he's always said, he goes, dude, lemme tell you something. Six armed dudes that know what the fuck they're doing could take over a whole city. I was like, really? He goes, cities are so vulnerable. We're so vulnerable. What? There's six dudes. He goes six, six operators really know what they're doing. Could take over a whole city. Guys who like used to work for Blackwater. Yeah. Come over. Yeah. Yeah. He's like, you'd be fucking surprised. So when you see something like this happen, it's like, how do they keep these fucking crazy people from like, well, You know, we need to do a better job of finding out where the meth is going. I know. You should fucking have a You know if you going to Tracy, illegal aliens.

2 (53m 9s):
But find out who's bringing in the meth. Who's bringing, where's that fucking meth coming in? I a lot of people are coming in Make it right. They just make it. Yeah. They can make it. Well, you need precursors.

5 (53m 17s):
They try to lock down most of the drugs for it now. Like the Sudafed and I mean. You gotta get a license to get that stuff down.

2 (53m 23s):
That's why these clown, the people that are making that, they're not using that. They're getting real chemicals. They're getting the real precursors. But you have to get 'em from like China. So they're, they're getting 'em from China, cooking it up in Mexico, bringing it across the border. And we

0 (53m 36s):
Yeah.

2 (53m 36s):
The truck stop. We driving all

0 (53m 38s):
Night bar. Breaking,

2 (53m 40s):
Breaking bed breaking.

0 (53m 41s):
Yeah. Say Walter White doing that shit. Yeah. Great.

2 (53m 44s):
Another great TV show I've talked about a thousand times. But it, there's a book that we just read. It's called Blitzed. This dude Norman Hur. Oh, the Nazi. Yeah. It's all about the Nazis. They they gave them Nazis meth

0 (53m 58s):
Oh. yeah. It is that scene of Hitler fucking watching the fucking games. Yeah.

2 (54m 2s):
But apparently that what they did was they were given a mess. So they could go three days through Poland so they could just storm through Poland. And so when they did this, no one thought they could get across the whole country in three days and you really couldn't unless you didn't sleep. So all they did is gave these guys meth. They gave a meth and they gave different meth to D Different doses to different jobs. So like, if you were in the tanks, they gave you the most meth. You're at the front of

0 (54m 28s):
The line fucker. Oh see, you're just like, just

That's what it feels like when you talk to 'em. Like they're not really there. But John's like right there.

0 (55m 7s):
He's also phenomenal in a movie that a lot of people didn't see called Shot Caller. Oh, Oh. yeah. Yeah. Shot Game of Throne with Jamie Lannister. Game of Thrones guys. Game of Thrones guy. That's a fucking great. What's it? It was good. It was good. Oh, it, it basically Jamie Lannister. I just know him as Jamie Lannister. He's You know. He's like a yuppie guy. He's going out to eat with another couple. He, he goes through a red light, he gets to a car accident. Next thing you know he's facing prison time. Oh. And he iss like not a guy made for prison.

Yeah, he was.

2 (56m 50s):
He was terrifying. Yeah. He had some

0 (56m 52s):
Hands on him yet he had crazy power. Yeah. Like if he, like if he did bare knuckle when he was younger, Oh yeah. He would've been perfect

Look at our

2 (57m 8s):

0 (57m 21s):
Jacked.

5 (57m 22s):
Yeah,

2 (57m 22s):
Definitely. With that Keith Jardine fight. Jardine had him hurt. And so Jardine got a little overzealous and, and game after him and Houston Alexander caught him. That was a shocker up. Keith Jardine was a name.

0 (57m 35s):
Yeah.

2 (57m 36s):
And then this just upstart, this guy coming outta nowhere. I think he was a radio dj. I

5 (57m 41s):
Didn't, he I think he beat s was Sakara after that. The Italian.

2 (57m 46s):
Unless Sakara. Yeah. And we had that crazy fight with Kimbo too. Yeah. Kimbo. But I think he was a radio DJ at the time. because you imagine

0 (57m 54s):
Being a radio dj, DJs and shit, you suck man. Yeah, right.

2 (57m 59s):
It was a radio dj. Why these fucking people up? It's kind of crazy.

0 (58m 3s):
It's like you in the barbershop. Dean Thomas. That's right. They complained about that fade. Fucking nah, ain't no complaining about my fades either. You did a nice you to hook my head up on a every week when I still had hair. Yep. That's how we became friends because they brought in on the Ultimate Fighter four. They brought in some chick. 'cause they know we, you know, we we're not seeing our, our fiances or girlfriends or anything. We have no women. We got no porn. We're not jerking off in the same rooms. So fucking they bring in some girl to do our hair

2 (58m 30s):
Code.

0 (58m 31s):
You know. Yeah. At least I said, as far as they know, I'm not off there. But, so they brought in some stylist and she's not giving me a fade. So I'm like, get the fuck out. Dean's like, I got you. I said, I got you man. Yo, give some and you, you up every week. Yeah. you know, to look good is the feel good. You probably the reason why I won that show you, you could never repay me for that. You were the best in times.

2 (58m 53s):
What season are they on now? 32.

0 (58m 55s):
That's crazy. You know what's sad, man. The other day I just did a a, a camera crew from Toronto came down. They're doing a thing called Dark Side of the Cage and they want to interview me about War Machine. And they came out and I did a thing for that. and I, it just depressed me. It just, it was just, it just brought me down. 'cause that was a kid. Did You know him? I had him on the podcast when he was That's right. When, when he was on the show. There's some guys that are just evil and there's other guys that I think that if they had the right people around them, they could have made different choices. And that's, he was like a, a goofy, he had issues. He was emotional. He always felt like the, the the stack was against Cards was stacked against him type of thing.

0 (59m 37s):
But, but I, but he was still, There was something likable about him on the show when he was on season six of the Ultimate Fighter. He was like, like a prankster. He did an upper decker in fucking the guy's toilet. He was like a silly guy. But I felt that if There was somebody, if he had the right people around him, I think he could have made obviously a lot better choices. But

4 (59m 57s):
Think about that. Like, but that goes for all of us, right. Because we all kind of came from the same shit from back in the day. Right? Yeah. And then me and Matt, you we still in the game. Yeah. But then look at guys like him and Phil Baroni.

0 (1h 0m 8s):
Well that's a guy who was asking, oh listen, that

2 (1h 0m 11s):
You can have too much, you know, you can have too much bravado. You can have too much crazy and then it'll ruin your life. Yeah. And there's like, every fighter has a certain amount of crazy and some guys keep their crazy ched.

4 (1h 0m 22s):
They keep it all locked up. Keep it locked up. Yeah. They keep it

2 (1h 0m 24s):
Locked up in a fucking behind that mask. But some guys, they just can't. They their crazy burns 'em down. It burns down everything around them. And then You know you got the CTE and CTE comes into play. Then there's a lot of guys that just get real impulsive. They become addicts. They fuck up all relationships. They can't keep their shit together. They're either crying or they're, they're angry.

0 (1h 0m 46s):
There's some guys that are just bad eggs. Like he

2 (1h 0m 48s):
Guys, there are guys that are bad eggs, but there are guys for sure that are bad eggs that then get CTE.

0 (1h 0m 53s):
Oh no, there's probably both. Yeah. But like War Machine, the one guy to show up at his trial to be there for him. And again, you show me your friends, you show me who you are. And it was Phil Baroni. Now Phil Baroni is not a good guy. I know the guy's from Long Island, A million stories about him and Well

2 (1h 1m 10s):
Isn't he in jail right now? Well,

0 (1h 1m 11s):
That's what I'm saying. In Mexico. Yeah. Not only did he be there for war Machine, he outdid him. You know when she put his girl in the hospital, beat the shit out of her. And now, you know, bar's in jail for, you know, allegedly, you know, murder Killing her Murder. Yeah. Murder. And in, in Mexico. Yeah. Porto, Porto Vallarta. I think, you know,

2 (1h 1m 29s):
It was like a bad one too. Oh, beating to death.

0 (1h 1m 33s):
Oh. yeah. Yeah. And now that guy, I mean, listen. Allegedly. Allegedly. Yeah. But it's brutal, man. So I You know these guys come You know again. But back to War machine, I don't know, it's, it, it makes me more like Phil I always knew was a piece of shit. But war machine, I felt Could have been helped. I really do. I mean, it, it is what's done is done. But I don't know, it depresses me. 'cause I thought There was some ho, There was some ho You had him on the show. Didn't you think There was something about

2 (1h 2m 1s):
I never would've imagined that he would've done that. Right. But I would imagine that he would lose his cool if anybody like challenged him. A male. A male. I just never thought that he would do that. I

0 (1h 2m 12s):
Mean, to a girl to the way he did that too. I mean, horrific. She eye was shut. The

2 (1h 2m 16s):
Whole thing is, it's just, just awful shit. Every part about is awful shit. Press the hell outta me. And how many guys that are doing this, like have also experienced that in their life. Like, seen their mother been beaten, been beaten by their father, grew up in an abusive household where everybody hits everybody. There's a lot of kids, unfortunately in this world that grow up with parents beating the shit out of them and beating the shit out of each other. Yeah. That's crazy. And You know if you ever talked to Joe Piper, man, Joe Piper Oh. yeah.

4 (1h 2m 45s):
Oh my God. That's my guy. He

5 (1h 2m 46s):
Was the podcast

2 (1h 2m 47s):
Crazy. The reason why he's a fucking assassin. Yeah. Right. Because that, that dude's angry.

4 (1h 2m 52s):
Angry. He angry all the

2 (1h 2m 54s):
Time. Angry all the time. And he hits like a fucking neutron bomb. He's terrifying.

4 (1h 2m 59s):
I was working with him last week when I was with with Brady. And him and We were doing elbows and I. My wrist still ain't the same right now,

2 (1h 3m 5s):
Bro. When he banged out Bario, I was like, Jesus Christ. I mean, with more seasoning. Jack de, I mean Jack Herman

4 (1h 3m 15s):
Hermanson.

2 (1h 3m 15s):
Yeah. Jack Hermanson fought a beautiful fight.

4 (1h 3m 17s):
Yeah. He just fought a beautiful fight. He outsmarted him,

2 (1h 3m 19s):
Outsmarted him out Time. Had more time in the game. Yeah. And, and Jack's standup has gotten a lot better. Yeah. Over the years. He used to be just this wicked grappler. But he can, I mean, he held his own on the feet and won the fight. Mostly with striking, right? Yeah,

4 (1h 3m 33s):
For sure. it, I mean,

2 (1h 3m 34s):
And pace. And just not knowing not to empty the gas tank. But Piper is so scary that he, everybody, he gets everybody out of there so

4 (1h 3m 40s):
Quick. Yeah. Piper is going to be up there with the best of him. Oh man. I promise you

2 (1h 3m 43s):
That. I believe you 100%. He's terrifying and like a dude like that, he needs a fight like that. Just to kind of like put it in perspective.

4 (1h 3m 51s):
Yeah. Put him in check. He said, all right. I got a lot more to learn.

2 (1h 3m 54s):
Yeah. This, you gotta learn the gas tank. Yeah. How many guys don't learn the gas tank? Right? You know. That's

0 (1h 3m 59s):
What's great about Brady the other day. Yeah. He incredible knew. He knew when to knew

5 (1h 4m 2s):
How to pace him

0 (1h 4m 3s):
In, put the foot on the gas.

2 (1h 4m 4s):
I was more impressed with his standup.

5 (1h 4m 5s):
Thank you. I earlier he was always grappling and I was thinking this guy I texted right

2 (1h 4m 10s):
After a fight. Very.

5 (1h 4m 11s):
And that was what I complimented

4 (1h 4m 13s):
And I gotta give, I gotta give props to John Marquez out in Philly. John Marquez be putting it together. He'd be putting in work with them guys. you know,

2 (1h 4m 19s):
You can tell he's a good student too, man. 'cause every fight you see him and I think in the Al Muhammad fight, early in the fight, he was given Bilal some trouble. Yeah. Standing up. But Bilal just put it, I don't want, it's nearly the respect he deserves,

4 (1h 4m 32s):
Man. Respect's the man,

2 (1h 4m 34s):
Bro. The way he put it on Leon Edward, he handled, how the fuck do you not give that guy all the props,

5 (1h 4m 40s):
Dude, he handled all Sean.

2 (1h 4m 41s):
He all the flowers. Sean, he handled Sean. Sean,

4 (1h 4m 43s):
He handled Gilbert

2 (1h 4m 44s):
Stopped Sean and everybody standing up. Sean, he stopped Sean standing up. You know. And, and then you, when you see what he did to Leon, you're like, good lord. Right. It just overwhelmed him. Overwhelming pressure. Yeah. And on

4 (1h 4m 55s):
The feet too. On the feet. Yeah.

2 (1h 4m 56s):
On the feet. Real fucking dangerous. Never lets you get set.

4 (1h 4m 59s):
Had Leon

2 (1h 4m 60s):
On

4 (1h 5m 0s):
The back had Leon making excuses about the time change. Put it that way. Yeah. Yeah.

2 (1h 5m 3s):
Man, it's a, it's a different kind of fight. Yeah.

5 (1h 5m 6s):
Leon never, never found his timing. Ever.

2 (1h 5m 8s):
Yeah. Fight. And bro, that guy going to Dagestan was like the ultimate move. Yeah. Oh. yeah.

4 (1h 5m 12s):
The

2 (1h 5m 13s):
Ultimate move you get involved with Khabib was smart. Especially with his kind of style and his work ethic. Yeah. Like that dude has a work ethic

5 (1h 5m 20s):
Made his his top control You know, look def definitely better. It's

2 (1h 5m 24s):
Credible. I also think it's good that he didn't get the props. 'cause it keeps him hungry. It keeps you hungry. It keeps you fucking 100 per I'll show you bitches. He's still like,

4 (1h 5m 32s):
And he still, yo, he's still like that too, man. He's still to be, he's still hungry and still down to earth. Like he ain't get all You know high class.

2 (1h 5m 38s):
No, no, no. Well he's just begun, right? Yeah. So this is a championship run. He, he proved everybody wrong. He won the title. He tell everybody fuck you. Even though he doesn't even swear he says fudge. He'll say like fudge you. I'm like, what's

4 (1h 5m 50s):
Wrong with you man? He's supposed to cuss. He's crazy.

2 (1h 5m 51s):
He doesn't cuss. But like that guy's just beginning his run. You know. So who knows. But that division, who

4 (1h 5m 58s):
Do you think they give him next?

2 (1h 5m 59s):
I think they give him Kama. That's what I thought too. That's what I thought. Fight. It's the smart fight and I think shock they're talking about too. But they owe Kama for Kama taking Hamson on 10 days notice. Right. And also in a three rounder instead of a five when he won the third. Right, exactly. So he's got the L which is, if it's going five rounds, maybe he doesn't get it now.

5 (1h 6m 17s):
Yeah, I think he does. I think he doesn't get the

2 (1h 6m 19s):
L If it was five, it looked to like he was coming on the third. He had to figure him out. And also he had to trust his gas tank. Yep. The guy trained 10 days. One of the scariest motherfuckers on Earth. On Earth.

5 (1h 6m 28s):
That's a gangster

2 (1h 6m 29s):
On earth. I say, you gotta give it to tomorrow. 'cause I think Kamar earned it from that alone.

0 (1h 6m 34s):
He had the weather, he had to weather that fucking storm of a first round. I know you're getting off a couch. Even if you're in great shape, you have to weather something like that. That could get your endurance down right there. Yeah.

2 (1h 6m 42s):
Done. Hundred percent. And he didn't, he had a no, like what, how do, how much do I have? Like how do I manage this? But he did manage it. He didn't get stopped. He didn't get finished. And then he comes on and wins the third round. You gotta go. Come on man. You won't have any more years of Kamar. He's like 37 now. That's what I'm,

4 (1h 6m 58s):
And he, he doesn't have time to go on another run. Right. How old is give him

2 (1h 7m 2s):
The title shot is 37. He's

4 (1h 7m 3s):
Gotta be 37 now. How

2 (1h 7m 4s):
Old's Kamar? I say he give him another shot. I said give him a shot. and I Shopko You know he's only, he got time. Not only that, every win he gets, he's a legend. Bigger and bigger legend. Yeah. Bigger and bigger legend. 37. See, give it to him. Give it to tomorrow. That's

4 (1h 7m 19s):
My And gave got them badass knees too, man. We can't. Yeah,

2 (1h 7m 21s):
Exactly. I send him, every time I find something on stem cells, I send it to him. Do you? Yeah. Yeah. Because they, they're regenerating cartilage now. No kid. I'm

0 (1h 7m 27s):
Thinking about doing that shit for my, I'm starting to feel my shoulders man.

2 (1h 7m 30s):
You should, you should do it. you shouldn about that. How long are you in town for?

0 (1h 7m 34s):
Tomorrow.

2 (1h 7m 34s):
What time tomorrow? Do you leave

0 (1h 7m 35s):
In the, in the morning?

2 (1h 7m 36s):
Yeah. What time in the morning?

0 (1h 7m 38s):
I think like seven or some shit. Oh,

2 (1h 7m 40s):
Really? Early. We'll

4 (1h 7m 40s):
Get you in at five 30 stem cells.

2 (1h 7m 42s):
I might be able to get guys this afternoon. Yeah, yeah. Really? I lemme see when we get out. I thought I gotta

0 (1h 7m 47s):
Go to Columbia

2 (1h 7m 48s):
For that shit. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No ways to. Well, can do stuff here. They do different things in Columbia. In Columbia, what they could do is they can multiply the stem cells so they can take stem cells. They do that in C, the CPI down in Tijuana. That's the place that's, and they have a, a whole arrangement with the UFC shit. They, they have a partnership with the U-F-C-C-P-I is incredible. And they're in Tijuana. Damn.

5 (1h 8m 9s):
Yeah. And my, my buddy has a spot at home called LifeMed. They have have a deal with the UFC as well. Ski goes there like a bunch of these guys doing that stuff.

2 (1h 8m 18s):
Stem cells are absolutely legit. Yeah.

0 (1h 8m 19s):
Yeah. Because I mean, listen, I got a new knee and it's holding up great. But I hear stuff with the shoulders. You're fucked. You can't get soldier surgeries and shit. But I don't, I'm not even

5 (1h 8m 28s):
Can can. But it's gonna, if you can't,

2 (1h 8m 31s):
It's gonna take some time. It's a complicated joint shit, man. Do you do anything to strengthen your shoulders? Do you do any workouts? Eh,

0 (1h 8m 37s):
I mean now, I mean, I do my pushups and I. I hang from my bar. Just

2 (1h 8m 41s):
Stretch the shit out. Anybody that has shoulder problems, I'm, I have no affiliation with these people. Get yourself crossover, symmetry bands. Get yourself these bands. What the fuck? They're, they're, they start with like five pounds or something like that. I use a 25 pound one. It's not, not a lot of force. and I do a series of exercises just to stabilize my shoulders. A whole series of different things that I do every week no matter what I do these, it's

0 (1h 9m 5s):
Just like that thing with the coils back in the day.

2 (1h 9m 7s):
It is, but its' just, it's like a bungee cord. It's a good cord. Like a You know A rubber strap that you're pulling on. Yeah.

5 (1h 9m 14s):
Yeah. Physical. My physical therapist has them too.

2 (1h 9m 16s):
Ones different ones have different weights to 'em. So you could start off low. Alright. But the whole idea is there's a, a whole chart that comes with it and shows you all the different things and it just strengthens all the shit that you don't strengthen when you're just lifting weights. Okay. Interesting. If you're just lifting weights or especially if you're just rolling, how often are you really using those shoulder muscles? You're using everything right? So are your shoulder muscles getting a good workout? Or is your cardiovascular system and your legs and your biceps and your back that getting a good workout. But you're gonna miss muscle groups. Yeah. Juujitsu misses muscle groups. And the only way to like really strengthen joints I think is exercise and I. Think you gotta do weights and bands and a bunch of shit just to protect your joints.

2 (1h 9m 56s):
That's like that knees over toes guy.

5 (1h 9m 57s):
This thing you were talking about too helps to really stabilize the You. know the connective, the ligaments. It tightens all the stabilizers up. And that's the, that's the thing everybody neglects. 'cause if you go too heavy, your dealt takes over and your rotator cuff's not getting it. So Exactly. You know this kind of, this kind of stuff is definitely should be used.

2 (1h 10m 16s):
That knees over toes guy gotta hold shoulder bulletproofing program too with like light dumbbells where you doing a bunch of these things?

5 (1h 10m 22s):
Yeah. I love his knee shit. See I

4 (1h 10m 23s):
Gotta do that because holding pads for people. Oh. yeah. Oh that tears your shoulders up man.

5 (1h 10m 27s):
And for you that's all,

4 (1h 10m 29s):
All day

2 (1h 10m 29s):
Long. All so I'm like, You know. I mean, isn't it crazy how some dudes just have crack, just have some extra crack.

4 (1h 10m 36s):
I'm telling you Joe Heifer. Oh, extra crack.

2 (1h 10m 40s):
Yeah, for sure. Extra crack for sure. I wouldn't wanna hold pads for that dude. You're gonna get carpal tunnel syndrome.

4 (1h 10m 45s):
Yeah. And that, and that's what happened to me all in one week.

2 (1h 10m 48s):
You had extra crack, you had extra crack crack, extra

3 (1h 10m 52s):
Crack. That's that's tried thing. You had a,

2 (1h 10m 56s):
You would catch people. You would catch people and you would see this like, oh no, look on their face. Like when you taught GSPI remember thinking like this because we already knew by then that you could knock people out with one shot, which was so odd for a Juujitsu guy. So like everybody had to worry about your ground game. But they always have to worry about being in the pocket. 'cause one of those hammers drops in there and you got a real problem on your hands.

4 (1h 11m 18s):
And I ain't gonna lie. When I fought Matt, I was like, I ain't letting him hit me with that right

3 (1h 11m 21s):
Hand. That's what I ain't gonna take me down before that. It's a little fire

2 (1h 11m 25s):
Plug. You said a thing, but you, you didn't have a background in striking as a child, right? No,

0 (1h 11m 29s):
I I, my father used to hold pads for me. I used, I had a wooden dummy in my garage. I used to do all that Wing

2 (1h 11m 34s):
Chung. Yep.

0 (1h 11m 35s):
And that's, and I'll tell you right now, if you're doing Wing Chung as a a, something to add on that's fun. But the trapping range, the grapplings right there. Anytime I got into a real fight, I'd start with a chain punch and then ah, do my ta double leg. So

2 (1h 11m 48s):
I think there's something to it for transitions. Me too. I think there's something to having all those moves. You know. Think about how many times you see boxers literally swat a guy's hand down to land a punch. Oh, the

3 (1h 11m 59s):
Pucks alley. That's Hey Punch's, Kamar Usman

4 (1h 12m 2s):
Jorge Vidal. Yes. Yep.

2 (1h 12m 4s):
Yes.

0 (1h 12m 5s):
But by itself its shit.

2 (1h 12m 6s):
Of course. But TaeKwonDo by itself is shit too. Those

3 (1h 12m 9s):
Everything by

2 (1h 12m 9s):
Itself as shit. Exactly. All those things by the, but I think I knew a dude who was really good at Wing Chung and he was explaining some things to me and what some of the things that he was showing me. There's, there's certain vulnerabilities if you're inside with someone where they can re really easily manipulate your arms back and forth and move your guard around and drop elbows on you like Wing Wing Chung and then Muay Thai, you see some of the Muay Thai stuff where guys grab wrists and

3 (1h 12m 34s):
Come over the top elbows. Yeah.

2 (1h 12m 35s):
There's a lot. That's a lot of Wing Chung.

0 (1h 12m 36s):
The difference is when you look at two Muay Thai guys get into a street fight, it'll probably look something like you're watching 'em in a Muay Thai fight. You put two kung fu masters in

3 (1h 12m 46s):
There with each other. Guys. It's the worst grappling match you've ever seen because it starts like a hit man movie and then they fucking on the floor. I go, what the, I go that

0 (1h 12m 56s):
White belt's winning guys are dropping

2 (1h 12m 58s):
Frank a lot.

3 (1h 12m 59s):
It's fucking horrendous. So I've seen a few of those You know,

2 (1h 13m 3s):
I've seen a few of those. Yeah.

0 (1h 13m 5s):
But I feel the Westin boxing, like Longo got me, obviously got to You know I had to learn on the job, you know, 'cause it's different back in the day because Yeah. Everybody had specialty everyth when UFC came out. Everybody's like, oh fuck. All the striking. So I was like, I had to, I, in my mentality, I'm like, all right, I gotta just close the distance. You can't trade. And then I had to relearn like, no, no, no. Sometimes you gotta be in the fire and you have to learn those mechanics and and whatnot. Well

2 (1h 13m 29s):
That's the difference between guys who are pretty good and guys who become champions is like this ability to absorb other skills. Yeah. And then implement them at a world class level while you're in adult.

4 (1h 13m 40s):
Yeah. Which is crazy.

2 (1h 13m 41s):
It's easy. It's

4 (1h 13m 41s):
Not easy to do.

2 (1h 13m 42s):
It's crazy. Crazy. It's crazy. It's very hard to do. And most guys they like are always gonna be a step behind the guys who started out as a child. Oh, a

4 (1h 13m 50s):
Hundred percent is natural. More natural to him. Right. Speaking of crack, speaking of crack mark Deeg Gotti says that you have the hardest kick that he's ever held for.

0 (1h 13m 58s):
Ooh. And that's something. And Mark dti

3 (1h 14m 0s):
Iss,

2 (1h 14m 0s):
That's a very nice for a lot of people you kick pretty hard.

4 (1h 14m 3s):
Yeah. Not, not a lot of people might give you

0 (1h 14m 5s):
Credit for today. And then he said, Joe, give him a line. if you give him a call, give him show soon. The way he's got the best fucking kid. No kidding. I like Mark de Lati on season four. We didn't have set coaches. He was like an assistant coach and he, he gave above and beyond for everybody. Yeah, no doubt. So shout de

2 (1h 14m 24s):
Lati. Great. He's a great dude and a great coach too. Oh. yeah. I love training with him. Yeah. He shows, he showed me all kinds of things that tightened up my technique. All kinds of things. All kinds of things. Like just in transitions, like transitional techniques, like different things to do off of different kicks and shit. He's

0 (1h 14m 41s):
Still teaching as a school, right? Yeah. He still has a school. Yeah. What is it called? Sig tos. That's what I was gonna say. Yeah. But he, but

2 (1h 14m 47s):
I trained with that dude. I tried to hurt him.

0 (1h 14m 48s):
You tried to hurt

2 (1h 14m 49s):
Him to

Hurt those arms. Oh. yeah. I hurt those

2 (1h 14m 51s):
Forearms. you know,

0 (1h 14m 53s):
He was letting us hit the pads, take them down, hit on the floor. Like he, he earned his, he earned his cash on fucking Ultimate Fighter. Yeah.

2 (1h 15m 0s):
He's he's the man. He's the man. And he's a great coach. And You know Speaks t fluent. Does he

Right now. I'm k No, no. I want Khalil round kicking at me exposing this.

2 (1h 21m 31s):
No, no,

0 (1h 21m 31s):
No, no. I'm Khalil. I'm sorry. It's emotions. I just wanted to tell you. I'm sorry. But

2 (1h 21m 35s):
That is gonna be a wild fight. I'll tell you what, Oh yeah, that's gonna be a wild fight.

5 (1h 21m 39s):
It's gonna be fan friendly for sure.

2 (1h 21m 41s):
Yeah. Khalil has probably never shot a take down in his entire career Has win too. I think

0 (1h 21m 46s):
Kil shot win. No, he, he's never shot a take down in the UFC bro. Khalil

2 (1h 21m 49s):
Hits anybody and he can knock you out.

5 (1h 21m 51s):
Alex gets hit. You know. I mean it's a,

2 (1h 21m 53s):
He does well, he puts himself, he's got that crazy style man. That's style. That's snake-like style that he has and the hands down. And

0 (1h 21m 60s):
He just kind of hold, yeah, he holds his hands right here. And just like pop pop,

2 (1h 22m 3s):
You've seen him sparring, right? You've seen some of those videos of his sparring. Like really good boxers, man. It's real good. Yeah,

0 (1h 22m 8s):
He's stay in the pocket with him too. And that

2 (1h 22m 9s):
Style is hard to handle because it's so weird. They're used to everything. Like that one boxer that he was training with, he's like, I don't know if he's professional, but he's a big heavyweight, very skillful. But everything was like real traditional. Right. And then you see Pereira's moving at You like a Cobra. Like it's so hard to figure out what the fuck he's doing. And you're lucky he's not kicking you. You know. He's just punching this dude.

0 (1h 22m 32s):
But hey, like you said, Khalil, if he lands,

2 (1h 22m 35s):
If he lands, everybody goes night

0 (1h 22m 36s):
Night. Yeah, for sure.

2 (1h 22m 37s):
Everybody goes night night And that guy's fast as fucked.

0 (1h 22m 40s):
I

2 (1h 22m 40s):
Know. And he, he fights angry.

5 (1h 22m 43s):
How old is Pereira?

2 (1h 22m 45s):
30? They're both about the same age. I believe 34 maybe. How old is Khalil? I think Pereira is 35 and I. Think think Khalil is probably in that same range. Alex is 37. Alex 37. How old's Khalil?

0 (1h 22m 60s):
Wow.

2 (1h 23m 1s):
Yeah, so I

0 (1h 23m 2s):
Didn't, I had no idea he was that

5 (1h 23m 3s):
Old. 37.

4 (1h 23m 4s):
But that's

0 (1h 23m 5s):
Like 34

5 (1h 23m 5s):
And fighting. Well, it's

2 (1h 23m 7s):
30. Well, seven Amazon Warrior years. Unusual You know. It's like, yo, and he don't

4 (1h 23m 12s):
Have a lot of damage. I was 36 on mine. Khalil's

2 (1h 23m 14s):
34.

5 (1h 23m 15s):
Speaking of

2 (1h 23m 15s):
Superheroes. Yeah. He doesn't, well he has some damage though. Some kickboxing fights. He, you know, he got stopped. Yeah,

4 (1h 23m 20s):
That's true.

2 (1h 23m 21s):
And you know the one with the bad one with Izzy? That was a bad one. That was a bad Koko. And that's a, a weight drain. Koko You know. Yeah,

5 (1h 23m 31s):
Definitely

2 (1h 23m 32s):
Koko at 85. I mean, just Izzy caught him with that perfect right hand of Well I

5 (1h 23m 35s):
Asked too because when guys, guys that fight like, like Roy Jones amazing, but an amazing athlete. He was so much faster than everybody he fought with. He could keep his hands down. Right. And still never get hit. But when he started to slow down Right. Everybody knocked him out. So it, I'm, that's why I asked how old prayer was. 'cause I'm like, maybe when he slows a bit and the hands are down. Yeah. You know button starts to get pushed.

2 (1h 24m 2s):
I think, this is my opinion with Ro, with Roy, what happened was he went up and he fought John Ruiz and then he went down. He

5 (1h 24m 9s):
Wasn't,

2 (1h 24m 9s):
And he fought,

5 (1h 24m 9s):
Tarp wasn't, I don't think he was the

2 (1h 24m 10s):
Same as that. He was not the same. I think. and I don't know. But I would imagine if you wanna get really big,

5 (1h 24m 15s):
What

2 (1h 24m 16s):
Do you do? There's not a lot of ways to get really big. Right. How do you want to, how do you go from 1 68 to 200 pounds? How do you do that? Well, you lift some weights and you

4 (1h 24m 24s):
Get a

2 (1h 24m 24s):
Little help. You got some friends, right? So then you have to get off of that. And then you have to drop 25 pounds from your body. So your body's fully acclimated to this. You got a frame. That's a hard cut. That's a point. And he looks, if you look at the way he looked pre Tarver fight, like if you, if you go back and watch him fight like James Tony when he was in his prime, you watch him fight like some, some of the better fights of his career. Like the Vinny Pza fight where he didn't get hit with one punch. Remember

4 (1h 24m 51s):
He tie around. I watched

5 (1h 24m 52s):
Nasty. I watched. He

2 (1h 24m 53s):
Was

4 (1h 24m 53s):
Nasty.

2 (1h 24m 54s):
But he was also shredded.

4 (1h 24m 55s):
Yeah,

2 (1h 24m 56s):
He was shredded and he looked like hard. Like

4 (1h 24m 59s):
He had the most, he's a rock defined bicep. Yeah. Lever left arm

2 (1h 25m 4s):
Twice as big as his. Right. So, but when you see him after the Tarver fight, he looks way more smooth. I think that cut was hard man. I think that cut was hard. And then he probably got off whatever he gone on You know. Yeah,

5 (1h 25m 15s):
For sure. Then your system's not working right.

2 (1h 25m 17s):
And if you don't have a good doctor and you're just trying to do this with Jim Bros. That's right. You

4 (1h 25m 21s):
Next thing you know, you're little shitty matrix equals

5 (1h 25m 23s):
Didn't have any HCG. And all of a sudden,

2 (1h 25m 26s):
Remember the Glenn Johnson one? You know the Glenn Johnson. Man, I

4 (1h 25m 29s):
Felt bad for him after it was was bad. He was getting real bad everything.

2 (1h 25m 31s):
That was a bad one. And that was off the Tarver fight. Right. And so you, you see like all of a sudden this dude just can't take a shot anymore. And Glenn Johnson, who was one of those unheralded, dangerous dudes that could really kind of beat anybody. That crazy clamshell style.

4 (1h 25m 44s):
Real? Yeah. Yeah. Who was the boy that knocked him out in Australia? Mm. I don't know.

2 (1h 25m 51s):
Kyle Zaggy didn't knock him out, right? No,

4 (1h 25m 53s):
But he he shut him out though. He shut him out. He him out.

5 (1h 25m 56s):
Z's tough.

2 (1h 25m 57s):
Zagi would just throw volume at

4 (1h 25m 58s):
Yeah, yeah, for sure. Just volume. And he Roy Jones. Roy Jones. He was in his face. Like, woo Babababa different

2 (1h 26m 5s):
Roy Jones though. Hundred

5 (1h 26m 6s):
Dro Jones. That's what I'm talking

2 (1h 26m 7s):
About. Yeah. if you, if you fought the Roy Jones that, that James Tony had a fight then Yeah,

4 (1h 26m 11s):
Yeah. Is different. That's, that's not happening. Different thing.

5 (1h 26m 13s):
One, one of the purest power punchers was Julian Jackson. Oh

4 (1h 26m 16s):
My God. Yes. The hawk. Yeah. Oh, oh my God. You know who Kevin, Kevin Holland's coach works with, used to work with him. Really? Really? Yeah. They, they're like really good friends. That guy had, that

5 (1h 26m 27s):
Guy was a

4 (1h 26m 28s):
Savage. That guy had power. Power

2 (1h 26m 30s):
Play that play. The Terry Norris fight. Julian Jackson. Terry Norris lost the Danny Green in Australia.

4 (1h 26m 34s):
Yeah. Danny Green. Danny Green. Yeah. Yo dude, I'm gonna use the head real quick. Right. Go.

2 (1h 26m 38s):
You don't have to say,

4 (1h 26m 39s):
You know my, yeah. Terry Norris. Terry Norris.

2 (1h 26m 47s):
Julie, Julian Jackson. Terry Norris. Right?

5 (1h 26m 50s):
Dude, you just do. Julian Jackson. Jackson highlights.

2 (1h 26m 52s):
This one's terrifying. This one's terrifying.

5 (1h 26m 54s):
Don't Well, Terry Norris, that poor guy. Yeah.

2 (1h 26m 57s):
Oh, he's, he's in real rough shape

4 (1h 26m 58s):
Now. I don't think nobody had more one punch power than Julian Jackson. No. No one short,

2 (1h 27m 2s):
Short punches too. Just was

5 (1h 27m 4s):
Tough. I used to love him. Yeah. Orlan Norris, he's good too.

2 (1h 27m 8s):
Oh they were? Yeah. His brother was a heavyweight and he was a 47.

5 (1h 27m 12s):
I remember

2 (1h 27m 14s):
I 47 and 54. Right. But watch this Julian Jackson Kao. It's so crazy. 'cause it's like he just shuts him off and he hit, he hit

5 (1h 27m 23s):
And Terry Norris was a killer. Oh,

2 (1h 27m 25s):
You know Coming up. This is Terry Norris. This is a prime. Terry Norris. This is a dangerous Terry Norris here, but he just catches him. What's this? Okay, so that was the first one. So you heard him with that left hand, but he catches him with the right hand and just freezes him.

4 (1h 27m 42s):
Oh my God. I'm gonna get my haircut just like his. Sure.

2 (1h 27m 47s):
One punch fighter. Yeah.

5 (1h 27m 48s):
This guy, guy. I was,

2 (1h 27m 49s):
Did some guys just like to say,

4 (1h 27m 50s):
Look at him stalking. He's waiting. I would be Ed hit you with it. Hit. I would be terrified if that guy was stalking me like that.

2 (1h 27m 57s):
It's just, he knows all he has to do is get you once and every time he hits you You know it too. 'cause you're like, oh shit,

5 (1h 28m 4s):
That upper cut.

2 (1h 28m 5s):
This is fucking terrifying. Oh man. So he is already softened him up and there it's, oh

4 (1h 28m 10s):
Man. Oh,

5 (1h 28m 11s):
Serious man. He took two more. He didn't need

2 (1h 28m 12s):
To. I know he took two more. He was out on his feet, bro. And those were windup ones. Jesus. The last two he took were windup ones. Oh, Julian Jackson was terrified.

5 (1h 28m 21s):
Short and Gerald mc short.

2 (1h 28m 23s):
Those

4 (1h 28m 23s):
Punches are just, oh,

2 (1h 28m 25s):
Gerald MCC

5 (1h 28m 25s):
McCuen had his number. I like, I, I felt so bad for him. Like, 'cause he got slept so fast and no spice.

2 (1h 28m 33s):
No. Gerald McClellan was a 75 pounder.

5 (1h 28m 35s):
Oh they fought twice.

2 (1h 28m 37s):
Gerald McClellan fought Terry Norris, Julian

5 (1h 28m 39s):
Jackson.

4 (1h 28m 40s):
Oh.

2 (1h 28m 41s):
Oh, that's right. But that's when Julian went up, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So was Julian a middleweight at this time? I

5 (1h 28m 45s):
Believe so. I mean in that race, the crazy

2 (1h 28m 48s):
Thing is like, I didn't know that because Terry Gerald McClellan and Julian Jackson were at the same weight class.

5 (1h 28m 54s):
Yeah. They wound up fighting twice. I was at one of the fights.

2 (1h 28m 57s):
McClellan though was like 1 75 though. Right

5 (1h 28m 59s):
At the MGM

2 (1h 29m 2s):
McClean was so dangerous, man.

5 (1h 29m 4s):
My first live boxing card I ever went to was in Vegas at the MGM and it was all rematches. It was Jesse James Laja and Azuma Nelson. Yeah. It was, I think it was Simon Brown and Vincent Petway. It was Julian Jackson and Gerald McClellan. And it was Julio Caesar Chavez and Frankie Randall. God, what

2 (1h 29m 25s):
Weight is this at? What weight is this at? Because I know they were trying to set up middleweight Crazy. So that's nine three that, so that's before, well they were talking about a Roy Jones Jr. Fight and I think he was his really Struggl that

5 (1h 29m 40s):
Ablo sat there big time. Yeah, because Gerald

2 (1h 29m 42s):
McClean, he was really struggling to make weight. Gerald

5 (1h 29m 44s):
Took his belt and then they rematched and he slept him like,

2 (1h 29m 48s):
And so the Nigel Ben fight, that was middle wave as well.

5 (1h 29m 50s):
Nigel Ben, man, he,

2 (1h 29m 52s):
That was the one that ended his career.

5 (1h 29m 53s):
Gerald McClean. Yeah dude. He was, I mean, in my opinion, There was a lot of rabid punching and he wound up having a blood clot in the back of his head after

2 (1h 30m 1s):
That fight. Well, There was also, they, There was a, There was a nasty headbutt in that fight too. But it's also Nigel Ben came back in that first round, which, oh, look at that ko. Oh my goodness.

5 (1h 30m 10s):
And in the rematch, he sleeps in fast.

2 (1h 30m 13s):
Oh my goodness. And what is going on with his hair?

5 (1h 30m 16s):
It was always,

2 (1h 30m 16s):
That's what they did back then.

5 (1h 30m 17s):
What is that hidden play? High top fade. Yeah.

2 (1h 30m 20s):
But I mean it's like that and like the little his sides, you need 'em cut. Oh my God. Gerald McClellan just coming after you for the kill. Terrifying. That's it. Yeah. Are they gonna let him count?

5 (1h 30m 29s):
He just had, he had his number man beat him both times. He fought. Well he

2 (1h 30m 33s):
Was one of the scariest punchers of all time. Yeah, both

5 (1h 30m 36s):
Of

2 (1h 30m 36s):
'em. But he, he's another guy who tried to empty the gas tank with Nigel Ben in that first round. And Ben survived and Right. And then he winds up having that brain bleed. That's, that's one of the scariest ones ever, man. Because is this the rematch? Yeah. Okay, let's watch this execution. I remember this.

5 (1h 30m 53s):
Yeah, I was at this one. This was in Vegas? Yeah. MGM.

2 (1h 30m 59s):
Well, once Gerald McClellan knew that he could put it on you, it's like his power was just so nuts for that weight class. But I always wanted to know like, what does he really weigh? He's like one of those benavidez guys. Like when you get in there, what do you really weigh? Because he, he really struggled with the weight cut. And that's one Oh my God. Right away. Oh man.

5 (1h 31m 20s):
That's why I, he gets him

2 (1h 31m 22s):
Just teeing off, dude, teeing off that shot to the body. My goodness. Oh

5 (1h 31m 28s):
Man. He can't even look up. He's not even giving him a chance to get

2 (1h 31m 31s):
Off. Just getting executed. Every shot's got murder on it. Oh that left to the body. Oh my goodness. The power in these fucking punches man. Just overwhelmed him. Yeah.

5 (1h 31m 45s):
Liver's shot.

2 (1h 31m 46s):
They're giving him a standing eight. Isn't that crazy? Standing eight count is kind of nuts. The

5 (1h 31m 50s):
Dumbest rule

2 (1h 31m 51s):
Ever. It's kind of nuts because you're concussed.

5 (1h 31m 53s):
I'm a making eight seconds to clear your head and get

2 (1h 31m 55s):
Concussed rule amazed iss the way to do it. It really is. Well you remember when Shooto

4 (1h 31m 59s):
Used to do stand in eight counts? Yeah. Back in the day.

2 (1h 32m 2s):
Yeah. Yeah. What do you think about red cards or yellow

4 (1h 32m 6s):
Cards? I think they should bring them back.

2 (1h 32m 8s):
What would you bring 'em back for? Stalling.

4 (1h 32m 10s):
Stalling. Yeah. Yeah. That's probably about the only thing you should bring 'em back for stalling. Like hanging, hanging out too long. Like, hey man, get to work. Mm. Like when There was a submission and like pride and they, they, the referee would be like, what do he say Sean? He say, what would he say? Catch Was it catch catch catch. Yeah. Catch catch.

2 (1h 32m 29s):
Yeah. When someone caught something. Yeah. Yeah.

5 (1h 32m 32s):
What do you guys think of Ortega and Lopez? Crazy.

4 (1h 32m 36s):
That's a good fight guard kind of. I think Lopez gonna get

5 (1h 32m 40s):
Him. I mean what gonna, I'm on that side.

2 (1h 32m 43s):
Lopez went through a roller coaster ride in his last fight. I know. Imagine that You got three different opponents. Oh. yeah. You got three different weight classes. Everything's changing. Well you got two different opponents. Right. But a bunch of different weight classes. And then Ortega can't make it. And so Ortega steps out and then he winds up fighting Ega. E Danny e Gay took it on hours. 50 k ega on like 40 minutes notice. Right. Dan was just chilling at his house. You know he might've trained that day. You

5 (1h 33m 8s):
Like something. I didn't know about that but I was watching DC was actually talking about this and he said that Ega had been training for five or six weeks. Obviously he took the fight on like a two hour call. They said Lopez had only been training for three weeks.

4 (1h 33m 24s):
Actually he took

5 (1h 33m 25s):
It on. He had a shorter notice.

4 (1h 33m 26s):
He he short. Yeah. That's crazy because it was short notice

5 (1h 33m 28s):
For him too because he got tired in the fight and everybody's thinking he's got a big gas tank. Well

2 (1h 33m 32s):
He had to cut weight too though.

5 (1h 33m 33s):
Yeah, that's what I'm

2 (1h 33m 34s):
Saying. He cut weight to 45.

5 (1h 33m 35s):
Yeah. So he had three weeks of training and weight up and down everywhere. So,

2 (1h 33m 39s):
And they fought at

5 (1h 33m 39s):
60. Right. And he, he was able to pull it out.

2 (1h 33m 41s):
Didn't they fight at six?

4 (1h 33m 42s):
Yeah. Because it was same day weighing. Yeah. Yeah. It was same day weigh. Yeah. Which

2 (1h 33m 46s):
Is crazy. And that was, which is really like no one should be cutting weight kids. Right?

4 (1h 33m 49s):
Like at this point, like if you make the fight happen, just let 'em show up.

2 (1h 33m 53s):
I think what they really should do, they really should do is just find out what you fucking actually weigh and just stop this fight there. Nonsense. Yeah. but shouldn be looked at the same way steroids are looked at. but shouldn be looked at the same way all other kind of cheating is looked at. It's sanction cheating. It is. You're not, not really

4 (1h 34m 9s):
155 pounds. I agree with you. Just whatever you weigh. Yeah. Just fight there.

2 (1h 34m 13s):
Exactly. And more options for weight classes.

5 (1h 34m 15s):
Do you think same day weigh-ins would change it, but

2 (1h 34m 18s):
It would get more guys hurt.

5 (1h 34m 19s):
I I mean they say that that's the real problem of dehydration and

2 (1h 34m 21s):
Stuff. I mean this is the reason why McClellan, one of the things they say about head injuries and death and boxing, the vast majority of 'em don't take place at heavyweight. So the guys who hit the hardest are not the guys who are getting these like, horrible brain injuries where they get dead in inside

5 (1h 34m 39s):
The rain. It makes sense. 'cause they're not cutting weight.

2 (1h 34m 40s):
They're not cutting weight. And the guys who die a lot like the duck k Kims like, if you look at the guys who die, a lot of them are

5 (1h 34m 46s):
Cutting. Boom was never the same after

2 (1h 34m 47s):
That. Right. Oh my God. How could you be, you killed a guy. Right? A lot of those guys that are dying are dying in the weight classes where they cut a lot of weight.

4 (1h 34m 53s):
Well, I mean, you're right. So like, like Sean Brady and Gilbert Burns over the weekend. Like there

2 (1h 34m 59s):
Ain't no way Shawn Brady's 1 74. That's what

4 (1h 35m 1s):
I'm No, no, that's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. Like, just let them fight it 20 minutes. Just let them fight at one 90. Right. These guys are one 90 pounds, 90. They walk into the cage at one 90. Right. They should just be fighting at one 90. They should

2 (1h 35m 13s):
Be fighting at one 90. And this way they both agree to it. You know. Yeah. You can't get any heavier than 1 94, whatever. But you, we know what you weigh. Like, let's just make a fight. Just show up the fight. Yeah. Yeah. Fuck all this weight cutting. It's just cheating. It's, and also the, the, the fucking drama of seeing if a guy dehydrated himself enough 24 hours before a cage fight. Right. Is somehow or another interesting to people where Daniel Cormier's pushing down on that towel. Remember that shit.

4 (1h 35m 38s):
Right, right. Oh. yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. Remember dc That's right. And ain't cheating if you don't get caught. It's

2 (1h 35m 44s):
Ridiculous. John Jones and Daniel Cormier were both fucking killers. Let 'em eat,

4 (1h 35m 48s):
Let

2 (1h 35m 49s):
Let 'em hydrate themselves. Fuck all this weighing in. You know what you weigh. Figure out what you weigh when you make the contract. Yeah. And

4 (1h 35m 55s):
Then then just leave it alone. That's what it is. Yeah, that's what it's

2 (1h 35m 57s):
That's what it's, that's what you weigh. And, and be loose about it. If a guy's a pound over a pound under, who gives a fuck?

4 (1h 36m 3s):
Well how about what they, but don't dehydrate yourself. But how about what they did? The Mikey Amichi. Oh, he got fucked on his situation. Well I mean he, he was going up and weight to fight K Olo. So he went up to one 70 and then like a couple days, like a week before, they're like, no, you gotta go back down to one 30 5K Olos out. So they're, and he's the champion and they treated him like this and they're like, you gotta go back down and cut 30 pounds. He gets sick cutting 30 pounds. Well he almost died. They took his belt. Took his belt, and then they took his belt. That's fucked up.

2 (1h 36m 34s):
Wait a minute. They took his belt.

4 (1h 36m 36s):
They took his belt belt for missing weight. For missing weight.

2 (1h 36m 39s):
Wait a minute. Really?

4 (1h 36m 40s):
Yes. That's what I'm saying. Like they like one totally fucked him.

2 (1h 36m 44s):
I didn't hear that. Yes,

4 (1h 36m 45s):
They took his belt.

5 (1h 36m 46s):
I, I saw man, I saw an article. How

4 (1h 36m 48s):
Can you take

2 (1h 36m 48s):
His belt when he's in the hospital for trying to do you a favor? Exactly.

4 (1h 36m 51s):
Yes. My point. Exactly. I was

5 (1h 36m 53s):
Shocked. 'cause that's really not what they're supposed to be about.

2 (1h 36m 56s):
I'm not, how are you gonna make this fucking guy fight after he almost

5 (1h 36m 59s):
Or they had a statement

2 (1h 36m 60s):
Or after he is cutting 30 pounds? How are you making him do that? He's cutting 30 pounds in three days. What's their statement speaks out. Okay, what did I say? After recent events, we feel that it's necessary to provide additional context on Mikey Meechi's withdrawal from the 1 1 68 Denver card ton and Muci set up Muci. Mikey was obviously put in a difficult spot when Cade Olo withdrew due to injury. When that happened, we worked closely with him and his team on a new opponent. Competing at Flyweight was something that he personally requested as he felt confident that he could make the hydrated limit of 1 35 pounds for a world title defense. This is not something we pushed to him to do on short notice or would have ever demanded of a one athlete given how much we prioritize fighter safety.

2 (1h 37m 48s):
After Mikey failed weight and hydration tests on Thursday, he requested an opponent submission grappling contest against Roberto Oli Ra and we continued to work with him to try to keep him on the card city Ong to continued on the mu mechi. He ultimately felt it was his best interest to withdraw from the contest. And we are honoring that, that this writing is uncertain when mu Mechi will return to one or who will compete for the now vacant belt. Mu Mechi was diagnosed with V pne

5 (1h 38m 19s):
Pneumo

2 (1h 38m 20s):
Media. Pneumo Meum Pneumo mediastinum a rare condition which air leaks from a part of the lung. Oh Jesus. Wow. You, how do you fucking strip a guy when he winds up in the hospital? Like they, he didn't fight.

4 (1h 38m 38s):
Right.

2 (1h 38m 38s):
Exactly. That doesn't make any sense. Like imagine if Alex is fighting Khalil Roundtree and I in making weight, he winds up in the hospital and the fight's canceled. He doesn't lose his belt. Well

4 (1h 38m 47s):
In this organization it does. That's crazy.

2 (1h 38m 50s):
That's what I'm saying. That's crazy.

4 (1h 38m 52s):
See another reason why weight cutting should be not

2 (1h 38m 55s):
Allowed anymore. It's nonsense. It's nonsense. It's terrible.

4 (1h 38m 58s):
This they're always gonna fucking

2 (1h 38m 59s):
Do it though. Yeah, but You know what man. I think it's a part of the culture that can be eradicated. I don't think it's impossible to eradicate it. That's like saying, oh they're gonna always do steroids. Well you sod it came along and they fixed that. Right. You know and now drug free sport, they fixed it. It's like most of these athletes are pretty clean. There might be a few instances of questionable

4 (1h 39m 18s):
Behavior.

2 (1h 39m 19s):
Perhaps a trip to a foreign land. See how goes to get to,

4 (1h 39m 23s):
But you're right, for the most part it

2 (1h 39m 24s):
Is for the most part. Yeah. Because

4 (1h 39m 25s):
We've seen like deteriorations of performance because guys have had to clean up the

2 (1h 39m 30s):
UIM era was the best era.

4 (1h 39m 32s):
Yeah. It

2 (1h 39m 33s):
Was when it was just a, it was an IQ test. I

5 (1h 39m 36s):
Was just looking at pictures of him today versus Uber e and it's pretty crazy. He's lost aton of weight or

2 (1h 39m 42s):
Oh, oh what? How he looks now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Now he is like, he's on a vegan diet and he's he's all spiritual. Really? Yeah. Alistair's like real thin now. Yeah.

5 (1h 39m 49s):
What is he He's maybe what 200 pounds? Yeah, he's,

2 (1h 39m 52s):
He's, he's thinner than he was when he was fighting. That's a weird picture. It's hard to tell from that picture. The best one I could find. He looked bigger than the other ones. Well he mean he's still a big fucking

5 (1h 40m 0s):
Guy. They have like side by side of him then and now.

2 (1h 40m 4s):
It's hard to tell in that picture. He's always gonna be a big guy. You know he's a massive man. But You know when he fought Brock Lesner he was just a freak of science.

4 (1h 40m 13s):
Yeah.

2 (1h 40m 14s):
He was the freakiest of all freaks. if you just let that dude juice it up like that, that that guy back in the day. Yeah. Whew. He was the most dangerous. 'cause those kickboxing skills were top notch.

4 (1h 40m 25s):
Or how about Vitor when he was on baby?

5 (1h 40m 28s):
Yeah. Right. Baby traps up to his ears.

4 (1h 40m 30s):
I know he had them turtle shells

5 (1h 40m 31s):
Boy back back. The old

2 (1h 40m 33s):
Youa robbed us of the real Uber him. Like if Uber him could have stayed Uber. Yeah. Could have stayed Uber and just continued at 2 65 when he fought

5 (1h 40m 41s):
Brock

2 (1h 40m 42s):
Baby, baby baby,

4 (1h 40m 43s):
He'd still be champ. Hey Mike Bateman

2 (1h 40m 46s):
Bro. Them kickboxing skills, his kickboxing skills were super legit. I think it was a K one Grand Prix champion that super legit kickboxing skills And

5 (1h 40m 55s):
He wasn't a bad grappler neither. He had a good guillotine. Yeah, he was a good grappler for

2 (1h 40m 58s):
Sure. He won the Abu Dhabi trials. Yeah. Yeah. In Europe. Yeah. Yeah. No he's legit. And man that fucking the kickboxing though.

5 (1h 41m 4s):
Ooh. Ooh.

2 (1h 41m 8s):
It's funny how You know you look back on those days like especially the juicy days and you wonder like what would the world look like now if We were under the same sort of protocols that were, that were under then if There was no real te forget about the TRT days 'cause that was, everybody lost their fucking mind. That was crazy. You're allowing guys to juice up. That was, that was crazy. But when There was just tests at the weigh-ins You know it's a different thing

5 (1h 41m 33s):
Man. Yeah,

2 (1h 41m 35s):
That's a different thing. Just testing at the weigh-ins. Yeah. No randoms,

5 (1h 41m 39s):
Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's for

2 (1h 41m 41s):
Sure. Yeah. IVs are fine. Yeah. Oh they are.

5 (1h 41m 45s):
That's

2 (1h 41m 45s):
The old days man.

5 (1h 41m 47s):
That is true. It is rough to get hydrated back up though without this. Yeah. Crazy. What was the explanation for that? Like doing away with them mask masking. People could use that to They use it to mask.

2 (1h 41m 56s):
Alright. Yeah. Apparently there's some ways that you can mask. You just over flood your system with fluids and it cleans out all the traces of whatever metabolites would be in there. I guess it You know there's probably a window where It would get back in your urine. You

5 (1h 42m 9s):
Know it's hard to get hydrated back. Yeah, that was kind of my point. 'cause it kind of takes away from safety. But I guess brother,

2 (1h 42m 15s):
We shouldn't be doing that. They shouldn't be dehydrating themselves four

5 (1h 42m 18s):
Hours. That's the point, right? Like if you to have that. But they are.

2 (1h 42m 21s):
I know, but, but it seems like you know this, I actually said this to the guys that bought the UFC when I, when I was talking to Ari about it, I was like dude, this is the first thing you should do. Figure out a way to get rid of the weight glasses as they are. Like whoever is is a champion in that. Keep 'em as a champion. Let them defend the belt at what they actually weigh. Like you gotta ba this weight cutting's the most. The thing that's gonna fuck us more than anything is just somebody gets really badly hurt because they had a really bad weight cut. Like You know guys have kidney failures for sure guys have died.

5 (1h 42m 49s):
You lose all the water around your brain weight and you're taking trauma. How have a weight limit? I mean weight class More weight classes you

2 (1h 42m 54s):
Think more. More weight classes you need a weight class definitely needs some. I think you need one every 10 pounds. But I think we should be A little bit looser on like what a person weighs. I think you should make a contractual obligation to like fight each other. You find out what a person weighs. He weighs his natural weight is 1 75. Do you want to fight him? Your natural weight is 1 69. You. You agree that you can't get any higher than 1 76. Are you cool with that? Yeah. Okay. I'm cool with that. That's like total. You don't have to think at all about cutting weight at all. And so the day before the fight, instead of almost dying, you're filling yourself up with carbs and nutrients. You're relaxing, you're gonna have a better performance. It's better for the sport.

2 (1h 43m 34s):
It's better for the healthy of the athletes. It's more representation of what a real 155 pound guy looks like. 'cause you see those guys when they get in there and they're 180 like D DRAs. Yeah. That is not an 185 pound man. He's fucking massive.

5 (1h 43m 47s):
Maybe they need to weigh in the day they're signing a contract to see where both of them are. That way no shenanigans and

2 (1h 43m 54s):
Either also You know also, but they need to hydrate you too. Like you dudes will fuck around with that.

5 (1h 43m 58s):
That's true. They'll still cut weight

2 (1h 43m 60s):
If they weigh in. So if we have a hydration thing, like say if you are gonna compete you, you, you need to be in shape in your fighting weight and then we're gonna weigh you in and we're gonna check your water levels. We're gonna check your hydration. Okay. This is what you actually weigh. You weigh 182 pounds in your prime Ready to go. Yeah. Okay. So this is what you guys are contractually obligated to stay in this range. So you can't get any higher than 180 3 or 180 4. You just give 'em like a two pound. Nobody's I have to take a shit You know. No one's going. No

0 (1h 44m 29s):
One's gonna be saying their real weight to begin with. Nah.

5 (1h 44m 31s):
But they say they won't able to stop

2 (1h 44m 33s):
Them if they fucking hydrate Test

5 (1h 44m 34s):
'em. Yeah, they test

2 (1h 44m 35s):
Them. So if they show up you, you say to a guy like look we are gonna show up. We're gonna test you at the weight that you're gonna fight at. So you can't get any higher than this and we're gonna make sure that you're not dehydrated. So we're gonna check you to make sure that you're not fucking around like pretending that you're one a hundred eighty two pounds, you're really 200 and you dehydrated yourself for the last four hours. Let's find out what you really weigh

5 (1h 44m 58s):
What they do in like Maryland for like high school wrestling, the before the season, the kids have to get the electric You know body composition. Yeah. And it sees what they weigh. It sees where their body fat percentage is and it says you can't go no lower than this. So they basically dictate to that they

2 (1h 45m 15s):
Should, they should do A little bit more. They should do blood. They should do blood hydration levels. They should check your urine. They

5 (1h 45m 21s):
Should. I think that would cost a lot for, they

2 (1h 45m 23s):
Should just do it school system to do it. Well I'm saying schools, I'm not, not school systems. What the school system's doing is great. I mean for the UFC they just need to be sure. Don't let anybody fuck around like, hey, he showed up at 1 96, you still wanna take the fight. Like what the fuck? It's 180 2, what are we doing? Right? The why's 1 96. The

4 (1h 45m 40s):
Problem is the UFC has the ability to do this. No other organization would have the ability to do this. That's what I'm saying. That's the problem is that and the UFC obviously could do it like at the pi like every year this is what we do. Yeah, that's But no other, or like regional level organizations wouldn't be able to do it. So it'd be a little tougher.

5 (1h 45m 57s):
I heard dozen California do some kind like Andy Foster do some kind of hydration testing there for athletes. Is

2 (1h 46m 2s):
That, I think he has a limit on how much you can gain. I think he has a percentage of, yeah,

4 (1h 46m 8s):
North Carolina does that too. They have a a limit.

2 (1h 46m 10s):
But then you're just making sure that guys dehydrated. 'cause guys are knuckleheads, right? Yeah. And they're, they're gonna dehydrate themselves anyway to have that size advantage. Yeah. Especially guy like McClellan who's think he's gonna take you out in the first round anyway and they, they're size bullies. Yeah. You should find out what you fucking really weigh and fight at what you really weigh at. It shouldn't be the ultimate weight cutting championship. Yeah.

5 (1h 46m 26s):
Better for your chin not to be dehydrated too

2 (1h 46m 28s):
For everything. Better for the longevity, better for the health of your physical body. That is literal performance. Your weapon of war perform for sure. Yes. For everything. Recovery performance. There'd be better fights. Some

0 (1h 46m 39s):
Guys are just,

5 (1h 46m 40s):
I like the pi that that's pretty, that's a good,

2 (1h 46m 42s):
Yeah.

4 (1h 46m 43s):
The PI can do

2 (1h 46m 44s):
It. Look, it can be done because if it wasn't and then all of a sudden people started doing it, It would be something people would call out if nobody ever cut weight and then all of a sudden everybody started cutting weight. everybody was like, what the fuck is this shit? Right. You're not 170 pounds Oh. yeah. This is

0 (1h 46m 56s):
A

5 (1h 46m 56s):
Lie. Right.

2 (1h 46m 57s):
How are you the 170 pound champion when you weigh 200 pounds? That's crazy.

5 (1h 47m 1s):
My, my wife hates that. She's, she, that's her biggest peeve when MMA is weight cutting. She's like, that's not even fair, you know? Well

2 (1h 47m 7s):
It is fair because you're both doing it, but it's not right. Yeah,

5 (1h 47m 9s):
Yeah,

0 (1h 47m 10s):
Yeah. It is tweeners though.

2 (1h 47m 11s):
It's stupid. It's bad for everybody.

0 (1h 47m 13s):
1 55 was brutal for me to make and but

2 (1h 47m 16s):
1 65, that

0 (1h 47m 18s):
Would've

2 (1h 47m 18s):
Been great for me. That's what I'm saying. Yeah.

0 (1h 47m 19s):
One 70. I was, I was small for one 70.

2 (1h 47m 21s):
So all you need is 10 pounds. Every 10 pounds we go. One 70 goes to 1 75, 85 95, 2 0 5, maybe 2 25. That's

5 (1h 47m 31s):
What I say. And then it's

2 (1h 47m 32s):
Super heavy open then as big as the fucking guy is. Right. Because I don't like this 2 65 bullshit either. I agree. I agree. When was the last time you weighed 2 65?

5 (1h 47m 40s):
I mean actually right now,

2 (1h 47m 44s):
But what year? The biggest Well you were, how big

5 (1h 47m 46s):
Were you? I was 3 0 5. Damn.

2 (1h 47m 49s):
So you would have to lose a fuck load of weight. You'd have to lose 40 fucking pounds. That's crazy.

0 (1h 47m 55s):
Yeah, no, that shouldn't happen.

2 (1h 47m 56s):
That's crazy. That's so hard to do. Like when you got a guy like Inno, that's a natural 2 65, which is nuts. Like he falls right there. Right? Like right in the hot zone. Like a natural shredded 2 65. But that's what he

0 (1h 48m 11s):
Really weighs. Yeah.

5 (1h 48m 12s):
I mean that's his actual obvious. You can see it.

2 (1h 48m 14s):
He's not cutting weight. Right. That's his actual weight. Right.

0 (1h 48m 17s):
That's the weight. Do they have the same shit in Be or PFL? What's the

2 (1h 48m 21s):
Guy? I think they, I don't think they have a super heavyweight. Yeah, I think it's, I think anybody has an active super heavyweight division in MMA that I'm aware of. No, no big organization. I don't think PFL has it.

5 (1h 48m 30s):
Japan really was the only place to put on this crazy shit. You like Buck Wild

0 (1h 48m 33s):
Freak shows. They were, they didn't give steroids. No.

2 (1h 48m 37s):
I lit 180 pound guy. Fight a gorilla. They give a fuck.

0 (1h 48m 40s):
They

2 (1h 48m 41s):

She's gonna hit you right in your porn stash.

0 (1h 51m 35s):
It's guy. Guy is the one that goes the distance.

5 (1h 51m 37s):
This

Might be the wrong one. This guy played football. The guy that I saw him. K oh oh oh, there it is.

0 (1h 51m 42s):
Oh

2 (1h 51m 43s):
Man. Seen that clip Oh. yeah, he

5 (1h 51m 44s):
Was pretty good.

2 (1h 51m 45s):
Yeah. Yeah. Fast hands. He could punch dude. He could punch. It was just crazy to watch a guy who's only willing to fight four rounds.

5 (1h 51m 52s):
King of the four rounders. It was awesome. You know

0 (1h 51m 55s):
He's used to that tough man shit, man. I fought in that when I was 18.

2 (1h 51m 58s):
There's a, a place for everything, right? Like, like the bare knuckle thing. Like We. were talking about Mike Perry before, before we started doing this. That that's the perfect spot for that dude. He should have told Jake Paul, listen, we need to fight, but let's do bare knuckle. Yeah, let's go. Or

5 (1h 52m 13s):
I'll do this. You do that You know. Trade him.

2 (1h 52m 15s):
It's a different thing man. It's a different thing with that guy. Well

0 (1h 52m 18s):
It's like Matt always says play to your strengths.

2 (1h 52m 19s):
A hundred percent. No doubt. But You know. You gotta take that payday. I mean, what did he make outta that fight? He probably made 10 million bucks or something

0 (1h 52m 24s):
Crazy. Yeah. And Jay, Paul's very smart man. Like he, he gets guys that he's, he's bigger

5 (1h 52m 28s):
Than, bigger than he younger than the only

0 (1h 52m 30s):
Time he fought another boxer. His size was Tom Fury and he lost Tom Fury. Good fight. Yeah. Tommy Fury. Fury.

2 (1h 52m 36s):
Very good fight. Very good fight. you know, I think he's like any other young up and coming boxer. It's just everybody dismisses him because he's a YouTuber for sure.

0 (1h 52m 44s):
It's easy to dismiss

4 (1h 52m 45s):
Him. But I was there when he knocked out Tyron and I was like, man, I'm done with this kid. I was like, I felt, I like I never, I never wanted to corner another fight in my life, man. I was like, yo, he just knocked my boy flat out on his face, man. It was, I was heartbroken,

2 (1h 53m 0s):
Bro. He has power. It was real power. And that's

4 (1h 53m 2s):
Why like everybody's talking about this Mike Tyson thing. I was like, man, they should not be letting this thing happen.

2 (1h 53m 7s):
I really hope he doesn't knock Mike Tyson out

4 (1h 53m 10s):
To me.

2 (1h 53m 11s):
I'll just be real bummed out to see Mike get Ko right. 58 years old

5 (1h 53m 14s):
At 60. Basically like

4 (1h 53m 15s):
What other sport are we? Would we let a 58-year-old man compete other than golf? Right. But You know what I'm saying? Like why are, are we letting this happen?

2 (1h 53m 22s):
It's kind of crazy. Yeah.

0 (1h 53m 23s):
But he's made for it man. Like he's made for it. Mike is, yeah. I mean it's,

2 (1h 53m 27s):
Listen,

5 (1h 53m 28s):
I'm dude, he's perfectly capable of knocking him out.

2 (1h 53m 30s):
He is perfectly capable if, if he zigs when he should act. If Mike can close the distance in a way that he doesn't expect. And Mike also has layers upon layers of attacks that are in his mind. He's forgotten more about boxing saying than Jake Paul has ever remembered.

5 (1h 53m 47s):
Yeah. It's just how quickly can it happen? 'cause how much gas is a guy like that

2 (1h 53m 52s):
Gonna have? Also why, how is he feel now? He might have been excited when he said he was wanting to do it, but how's he feel now? You got months and months and months of this. I just

5 (1h 53m 59s):
Want to see. So so on him, something

2 (1h 54m 0s):
In his mi, does he dismiss the does? Does he wish he didn't say yes to it? How's his health? How's his back? How's his

5 (1h 54m 7s):
Knees? But seems to be have fun having fun when he is promoting it. Yeah. You know. He seems to be,

2 (1h 54m 11s):
It's also, he's probably on mushrooms bro.

0 (1h 54m 14s):
And it's also risk verse reward. Like if he loses, he's also almost 60. If he wins, fuck man. That's another great, imagine he knocks him out.

5 (1h 54m 23s):
It's mystique.

2 (1h 54m 24s):
He's a monster. Look at the, at the end of the day, Mike Tyson's a monster and if he can get that monster to just move in and close the distance and he, if he uncork saw boom boom on Jake Paul and watch Jake Paul going to Queer Street. That will be wild to watch a 58-year-old Mike. That be wild. It would the best case scenario for the world.

4 (1h 54m 42s):
I agree. For sure. Best scenario, worst case scenario. Yeah.

2 (1h 54m 45s):
Someone gets hurt. Yeah.

4 (1h 54m 46s):
Best case scenario for the world is that he knocks Jake Paul

2 (1h 54m 48s):
Out. Yeah. Best case scenario is Jake Paul realizes immediately he's in there with Mike Tyson. That Mike Tyson, at least for round or two first time

5 (1h 54m 56s):
Tyson. Yeah. Maybe he gets cracked. It's gonna, I guarantee that his head's gonna be like, oh

2 (1h 54m 60s):
Shit. It's gonna be interesting to see what happens. How

0 (1h 55m 2s):
Many rounds is it? I

2 (1h 55m 2s):
Think it's eight. Yeah. Eight. Two minute rounds.

5 (1h 55m 5s):
That two minutes. Yeah.

2 (1h 55m 6s):
I think they're doing two minute rounds. and I think they have that's a little better. Do they have 10 ounce gloves or 12 ounce gloves? Jeremy? It's a lot better.

0 (1h 55m 11s):
The two minute rounds.

2 (1h 55m 12s):
Yeah. I think they're making him have slightly bigger gloves. 14 ounce. 14 ounces. That's so sparring gloves pretty

4 (1h 55m 18s):
Big. Yeah. And it's not sanctioned, right? Almost. It can't

2 (1h 55m 20s):
Be sanctioned. It's sanctioned. It's sanctioned. It's sanctioned.

4 (1h 55m 22s):
How do you sanction that?

2 (1h 55m 23s):
Texas? Yeehaw. Same place you can own a giraffe.

4 (1h 55m 28s):

Is that true

2 (1h 55m 51s):
Though? Yes, that's true.

0 (1h 55m 53s):

The the cops are looking through the pho right there looking through the window. This guy at a tiger in his fucking apartment. Oh my God.

Look at that thing

2 (1h 56m 58s):
Bro. How insane is that photo? Was that, was the guy in There? was he eating? I don't think the guy got killed. I think they just found out the guy had a tiger in there and they had to go in and dart him and then they had to drag him out there and take him to the zoo. That's crazy. Yeah. The dude had a 450 pound cat in his fucking apartment. Like how

0 (1h 57m 15s):

Just watch the new Plenty of the Apes movie that King came out.

2 (1h 58m 14s):
Is that supposed to be good? Those Aren bad though.

0 (1h 58m 16s):
Out now I, from what I've seen, those aren't bad.

2 (1h 58m 18s):
How's that alien movie? Did you see that?

0 (1h 58m 20s):
The new one? No,

2 (1h 58m 21s):
I heard it's good. Really? Yeah. I've seen, yeah, I heard it's real good. I heard it's scary as fuck. I heard it like goes back to like the first alien where they're like hard to find. It's scary. They were, after a while they were everywhere and you just shoot 'em. Right. You know. Like the first one, you couldn't even find that fucker. They fucker. He was like sneaking around.

0 (1h 58m 35s):
Kill aliens was different.

2 (1h 58m 37s):
Acid blood. Yeah. He was so

0 (1h 58m 38s):
Aliens. Aliens was phenomenal. Aliens was such a great sequel to Alien 'cause it was a different take on it. And then the space, the Marine space, Marines and fucking Newt and fucking Hicks. Hicks was great. Hudson, was it good? Oh, Hudson was fucking great. Bill Paxton.

5 (1h 58m 54s):
Hell Oh. yeah. Yeah. It was great.

0 (1h 58m 55s):
Game Over, man.

5 (1h 58m 56s):
Good movie over. But it was

2 (1h 58m 57s):
A totally different kind of movie, right? Oh. yeah. So you got Ridley Scott does the first alien suspenseful and you got the suspenseful. Yeah. Terrifying thing. And people start coming up missing and You know it's fucking hiding in the ceiling.

0 (1h 59m 11s):
You're thinking Tom Everett's gonna be the hero. Right? And then all of a sudden he gets taken out. You're like, wait, wait, what? What? Oh, it's gonna be Sig. Right? She's the hero.

2 (1h 59m 20s):
She was the first male or female female lead of a monster movie action movie where you didn't go, oh, they're pushing a woman on me. Oh, she was

0 (1h 59m 30s):
Right.

2 (1h 59m 31s):
You believed it. Yes, yes, yes. You believed that this lady scientist got stuck in this fucking spaceship with a demon. Oh,

0 (1h 59m 37s):
This is great. Oh,

2 (1h 59m 38s):
That movie's so good. Aliens. It is so great. Aliens is good, but Alien is better. No, because it's hard to kill blasting and aliens. They're shooting them left and right. They're all over the place in the, the people in Aliens Alien one would've been done in five minutes. Like there it's dead. You know. But in this one, they kill so many of 'em until they get to the mother. And then when the mother doesn't kill her, when she's wearing the robot suit, I'm like, shut the fuck up, bitch.

0 (2h 0m 2s):
Fuck. But I like shut what? She's like get away from her.

5 (2h 0m 5s):
Do thinking the first one. In the first one, you really didn't know what was going on. And the second one, they were prepared for what they were coming up against. The

2 (2h 0m 12s):
The thing is, there's too much exposed, I don't buy it if she's in a robot thing where she's completely encased. Okay. But she's just all out there.

5 (2h 0m 21s):
Yeah.

0 (2h 0m 22s):
Tissue.

2 (2h 0m 22s):
I agree.

5 (2h 0m 23s):
Exposed.

0 (2h 0m 24s):
Get away

2 (2h 0m 24s):
From her. You bitch. This is a giant alien. How is that thing not gonna fuck? It moves way quicker than people. How's that not gonna fuck you up instantaneously with your stupid ass slow robot. Yeah.

0 (2h 0m 35s):
There's so many moments in that though. That movie when they're like, when they barricade themselves in the, in the, in the, in the one room. And they're like, they, they have the monitor and they're like, they're through the wall that's, that's inside the room. It can't be inside the room. All of a sudden they look up and he pu and then you see Hicks, he looks, he pushes up the tile and you see them all crawling in the fucking Yeah, that was fucking money. Fucking

2 (2h 0m 58s):
Money. That

0 (2h 0m 59s):
Was money. What a

2 (2h 0m 59s):
Great movie. It's a great movie. It's just a different kind of movie. You know I was,

5 (2h 1m 4s):
I was hoping they would've got more into like the engineers. Like when they did that Prometheus. Yeah. That they would've got into those people. But they really, it wasn't much of the movie you noticed

2 (2h 1m 12s):
Prometheus was good, but the one after Prometheus was better. What was that one? Jamie? What was the last one? With

0 (2h 1m 18s):
Kenny McBride in it, right?

2 (2h 1m 20s):
Yes.

0 (2h 1m 20s):
That was because he ended fucked up million.

2 (2h 1m 22s):
Covenant. Covenant. Yeah. I wonder if I saw it. He wasn't Jesse Sette in that one too. He was. He was in that one. No kidding. This is a good one. No man. This one's good. Please

5 (2h 1m 33s):
Tell me. Died early.

2 (2h 1m 33s):
Because this is another, no man, he's in there. He's in the spaceship. He's working the controls. This is Oh. yeah.

0 (2h 1m 40s):
This

2 (2h 1m 40s):
These, this is a real good one. This is, this one's fucking good. This is, this one's really good. And again, the aliens in this one, they're, they're hard to get

0 (2h 1m 48s):
Ahold of. Oh, that's, is that Michael Fastbender? Yeah.

2 (2h 1m 50s):
Yes. Yes. So these are the things that gets in your ear. Look at this. Oh, little

0 (2h 1m 54s):
Spores

2 (2h 1m 55s):
Get inside you from that egg. It's a good one man. This is a really good one. Yeah, I did. I did remember this. When these dude start shaking when it gets him.

0 (2h 2m 4s):
Mm.

2 (2h 2m 5s):
It's fucking great. That's a good one. Yeah, I bet. I heard the new one is really good too. I think the new one's really Scott too as well. Right?

0 (2h 2m 11s):
And he's doing the new, is he doing the new gladiator? Really?

2 (2h 2m 14s):
Scott? Did he do the new gladiator? I

0 (2h 2m 15s):
Zel. I mean I know Oh. yeah. I can't wait. I know it's coming out. I'm on the fence with that. What? I'm on the fence with it. Why? I don't know man. How could you be on the fence with that? I don't know. I mean, what are they seen it? It looks like he's like, I don't know. Is he talking like New York slang Denzel on the fucking thing? No man.

2 (2h 2m 32s):
Oh, did people said something about his accent. Right? I don't know. What is the accent that people have an issue with? That's what I said. Can we hear Denzel? Let's hear his accent. Let's see what

0 (2h 2m 40s):
He's,

8 (2h 2m 41s):
Where were you born?

9 (2h 2m 42s):
I don't know. I never knew a mother nor a father.

8 (2h 2m 47s):
You will be my instrument.

0 (2h 2m 49s):
You are You. like Denzel be sound

2 (2h 2m 52s):
Like a regular dude. Yeah, but they want 'em to have a British accent. They always want people when they're speaking another language translated English. They always want them to have a British accent.

0 (2h 3m 0s):
I know. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter where it took. It's Rome. Right. Isn't that weird? Everyone

2 (2h 3m 6s):
Taught single time in a different way.

0 (2h 3m 7s):
Yeah. Yeah.

2 (2h 3m 8s):
It's weird. It is kind of weird. This is

0 (2h 3m 10s):
In India. I mean You know what I'm saying? Don't matter where it is. They want 'em to have a British accent.

2 (2h 3m 15s):
This is in Rome? Yeah, this is in Italy. Ever. Why? Why would they? Wow. Did they talk like

0 (2h 3m 19s):
This?

2 (2h 3m 20s):
But there's something about like hearing regular modern English in the old timey movie. Like nah, nah.

0 (2h 3m 25s):
Like you don't buy it now. Yeah.

2 (2h 3m 26s):
You need an accent. You know like thi and Lannister.

0 (2h 3m 29s):
Yeah.

2 (2h 3m 30s):
All the people in Game of Thrones, they all had an English accent. Did they

0 (2h 3m 33s):
Speak Latin with an Italian accent

2 (2h 3m 34s):
Back then or did they over? That's good question. Don't think they spoke Latin. I don't think these people were speaking Latin. Were they in

0 (2h 3m 41s):
Rome? Yeah, they may have been up.

2 (2h 3m 43s):
Were they speaking Italian or were they speaking Latin? They would've been speaking Latin back then. Okay. But see, here's the question. The reason why I asked this. When Martin Luther was translating the Bible in the 15 hundreds or the 14 hundreds, whenever that was the, the reason why the Bible was the priests would be the only one that could tell you the word of God. 'cause they're the only one that could read Latin. So no one spoke Latin. No one read Latin. They couldn't read it. So these people didn't know what was in the Bible until Martin Luther Transl. He translated into phonetic languages, translated I think German and a couple other languages. Got it. Got eventually translated to, so then people could read the Bible for themselves. Whereas before it was just Latin. So when did Latin die off? When did they stop using Latin?

2 (2h 4m 24s):
Hmm. Because Latin's a weird one. Like you learn it in school but you're never gonna fucking use it.

0 (2h 4m 29s):
Roman Latin Greek I didn't learn in school.

2 (2h 4m 30s):
They spoke Latin and

0 (2h 4m 31s):
Greek.

2 (2h 4m 33s):
Like when did Latin go? Isn't it crazy? So the Roman Empire, they spoke a language that's dead. It's a dead language. Which

0 (2h 4m 40s):
Is bananas.

2 (2h 4m 40s):
It's gone now. Gone

6 (2h 4m 41s):
4 76. That's probably what people stopped speaking it. But priest probably still knew because of everything was written. Right.

2 (2h 4m 46s):
So there it is. After, after F bro and 4 76 ad Latin began to die out and distinct local Latin dialects developed. Wow. So these dialects eventually interesting evolved to romance language like Italian and Spanish. Which is crazy. That means those languages are only 500 fucking years old. That's nuts.

0 (2h 5m 4s):
But if you see a movie about it, it was English. With an English accent. Right? Yeah, of course. Of course. Yeah, of course. But isn't

2 (2h 5m 10s):
It crazy that those languages like Italian is only like 500 years old? Who the

5 (2h 5m 14s):
The fuck would've guessed that? Yeah. I mean there's lot of similarities between Spanish and Italian as well.

2 (2h 5m 18s):
Oh. yeah. They all, well Texas is way bigger than all those places, you know, which is nuts. Like Europe, when you look at America, it's basically like Europe. Right? But we don't call it different countries. Right? But Kentucky is so much different than Los Angeles. you know,

6 (2h 5m 33s):
It's, it'd be 1500 years old, not 500.

2 (2h 5m 36s):
Oh, that's right. Duh. 20. Yeah. 15. And and

5 (2h 5m 39s):
None of us us caught that either. How did I not

2 (2h 5m 41s):
Catch it?

6 (2h 5m 42s):
You're just seeing it. You're seeing it and saying it. Not,

2 (2h 5m 44s):
Not so, I'm sorry, 1500 years. Still language is developing that You would think they're older than that.

0 (2h 5m 51s):

5 (2h 7m 60s):
That shit. That's

4 (2h 8m 1s):
What it felt like.

2 (2h 8m 1s):
Yeah. You, you didn't think it was gonna kill you.

4 (2h 8m 3s):
I grew up on that shit.

0 (2h 8m 5s):
All of it.

2 (2h 8m 5s):
Yeah, we all do. I used take Frosted Flakes and put sugar on, on top

5 (2h 8m 7s):
Of all

0 (2h 8m 8s):
It.

2 (2h 8m 10s):
Remember those days I you loved grape. You

5 (2h 8m 12s):
Get down bottom

2 (2h 8m 14s):
With sugar.

4 (2h 8m 15s):
And if I ain't had no milk, I had Kool-Aid in there. Add to add to my sugar. Yep. Water

5 (2h 8m 20s):
In it.

0 (2h 8m 21s):
I remember remember Travis Lutter? Yeah. Yeah. Some guys are like too smart for their own good. I remember I'm eating raisins in there and I'm and he's eating fucking Kit Kats and shit. I'm like, Oh. yeah. He's like, sugar, sugar. I go, I don't, I don't think it works like that. Right. I'm not a, I'm far from a fucking, I i a nutritionist but I don't think You know. I don't like to fucking

2 (2h 8m 40s):
Race. There's something be said, there is something to be said for drinking things that have a high sugar content after hard training afters. That's, that's fact. And you know who's to do that? Floyd Mayweather. Floyd Mayweather used to be having these crazy workouts and he would crack open a Pepsi and people were like, what the fuck is he doing? Like he's crazy. But no, he is not, he's smart. Like you It would as hard as that guy worked out,

5 (2h 9m 1s):
It replenishes your muscle glycogen right

2 (2h 9m 3s):
Away. Well you're getting that muscle glycogen in a crazy way that you really not gonna get any other way. Like I don't recommend drinking soda. I like it. It's fun. I like to drink a soda every now and then. A real one. But he used to drink it after training. Right?

4 (2h 9m 14s):
Well that's what like Paul Felder does. Like after like a long bike ride. Yeah. Yeah. He would talk about like drinking a soda.

5 (2h 9m 19s):
Yeah. The best times to do it are like they say either when you, if you wake up just 'cause you you're fasted or after a big out there to safest times to

2 (2h 9m 28s):
Do that. Yeah. I mean he's there drinking a coke and you would think like there's no way this guy, he treats his body like a temple. But he does. He's smart. That guy did it the right way. Never drank. Yeah. Never partied. Never was outta shape. Never got fat. Would run home from the club at two o'clock in the morning. Two in the morning in his jeans.

4 (2h 9m 46s):
Yeah. Just, just

2 (2h 9m 47s):
Fucking getting in work. Never outta car behind

4 (2h 9m 49s):
Him. Yeah.

2 (2h 9m 50s):
He gotta was different. See all the mistakes. Yeah. And he is like, I'm not making any of

4 (2h 9m 54s):
These. Yeah. He was built different too. Like he's smarter. Yeah. Smarter than everybody and

2 (2h 9m 59s):
I can't knock everybody out. But I can get everybody to want me to get knocked out and so people come to see me get knocked down and I beat everybody. Ha.

4 (2h 10m 6s):
That's right. Yep. Right.

5 (2h 10m 8s):
I mean he's definitely the greatest defensive fighter of all

2 (2h 10m 11s):
Time. Of all time. If boxing is hit and doesn't get and don't get hit. Who's better than Floyd? Right? Zero people. Who, how many people cracked him in his career? You like sugar Shane. Right. Shane cracked him.

5 (2h 10m 23s):
I mean I chop chop DeMarcus Corley cracked him.

2 (2h 10m 26s):
Yeah. Cracked him once. And then

0 (2h 10m 28s):
Connie McGregor, the

4 (2h 10m 29s):
Homeboy

2 (2h 10m 29s):
From Argentina. Homeboy from Argentina. Mad Donna.

0 (2h 10m 35s):
Donna. Yeah. Donna Myna.

5 (2h 10m 36s):
Donna. The first, first Madonna fight was pretty made

2 (2h 10m 40s):
My donna knocked his tooth out and then would carry it around on a necklace. My mad Donna has Floyd May with there's tooth. Does he really? Yes. Show it Jamie. My donna has Floyd. I did not know that. His tooth, like on a gold necklace, a

5 (2h 10m 52s):
Lot of people thought my Donna won the first one. But

0 (2h 10m 54s):
Think about that. Like if, if this

2 (2h 10m 56s):
He crack, he definitely cracked him at the end of that round and wobbled him and then it was right at the bell. And so then Floyd got back on his bike and started out boxing him. But my donna, see there it is. There's his tooth. See there it is. He's got it knocked out and he keeps it around his, he keeps around his fucking

0 (2h 11m 10s):
Neck. Think about how good defensively you have to be that we can count how many times you've been cracked. Sure.

2 (2h 11m 16s):
Amazing. Yeah. Amazing. But also could recover. Yeah, for sure. Floyd could recover. He just had a lot of hand injuries. How

0 (2h 11m 22s):
Do he find his tooth in that motherfucker? So he's like probably telling his, I get that mother motherfucker in you necklace.

2 (2h 11m 28s):
See it in the fight. It flies out of his mouth and one of the cornermen saw it and grabbed it. Damn. Yeah.

5 (2h 11m 34s):
That's great.

2 (2h 11m 34s):
Great. That's hilarious. That's funny. Like we need that. That's a

5 (2h 11m 37s):
So

2 (2h 11m 38s):
Veneer second

5 (2h 11m 39s):
He Floyd got the, the, the ring bigger and he just destroyed him in the second one 'cause he had more room to run. The first one my donna was kept getting him on the ropes, getting him on the ropes and beating him up.

2 (2h 11m 50s):
Well if you're gonna have a a rematch with a master technician, he's gonna figure out all your little

5 (2h 11m 55s):
Yeah. Oh. yeah. He's the shock caller. So did you see, I'm trying to say how big the ring is and everything.

2 (2h 11m 59s):
Super lack in, in one fc.

0 (2h 12m 2s):
I didn't see that? No. What is that

2 (2h 12m 5s):
Dude? Super le is this badass moay tie fighter. And he fought Jonathan Haggerty. Who was the, was that,

0 (2h 12m 13s):
Was that when he hit him with the elbow? Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.

2 (2h 12m 16s):
Slick. Yeah. But I saw an interesting breakdown. Here it is. So hagger. Look at this. He caught him with that over top elbow, like real quick in the fight. I think it was like 40 seconds. Look at that beautiful ko. So they had a real good fight in the first fight. It was six years ago. And Haggerty became the champion and everybody thought, you know, like this is gonna be much, much different fight. But what I saw that was interesting oh, was someone broke down. There was a, a video breakdown of his tells that Haggerty has a certain hop hop. And then he goes in and then Super Luck had timed it and he tried it earlier in the round and didn't catch it. And in this one, look at this perfect timing, it gets his head off the center line.

5 (2h 12m 54s):
Fred Temple too.

2 (2h 12m 56s):
Oh my God. Perfect Del Elbow. This is the thing that I love that one FC is doing. I don't love what they did to Mikey Bus imagining, but what I love what they're doing is they're having world class moay hai fighters and they're putting them in these giant cards where like tens of thousands of people is on Amazon. Yeah. And then so millions of people are gonna see it around the world on Amazon and it's on the internet. So all these people are gonna be able to see it on YouTube. And it's exposing people to these guys that are just like super high level strikers that you're not gonna hear about 200 fights like Rat Tang. Who would've heard of Rat Tang if it wasn't for one? For sure.

4 (2h 13m 31s):
For

2 (2h 13m 32s):
Sure. Right. Now everybody knows who he's Yeah.

0 (2h 13m 33s):
That fucking elbow reminded me. It just brought me back to Wyman versus Mark Moz Oh. yeah. Oh my God, that's the fucking elbow. That was a good bus. The fucking elbow.

2 (2h 13m 42s):
Exactly.

4 (2h 13m 43s):
And that fight, I think was what inspired Chris Padilla to use the elbow against Ron Zoo over the weekend. Really? Yeah. And busted his eye wide open. They stopped the fight 'cause of

2 (2h 13m 52s):
That. That's interesting. We're gonna watch this.

0 (2h 13m 53s):
Watch this one

2 (2h 13m 54s):
Right out one's incredible. This is prime

0 (2h 13m 57s):
My

2 (2h 13m 57s):
Goodness. The timing on that. He was that old man dude. Prime Wideman was a motherfucker, dude. A hundred percent. He was a motherfucker.

0 (2h 14m 4s):
Look at his sailboat. Longo had Man,

2 (2h 14m 7s):
Dude. Oh my god. Phenomenal. So clean. It's phenomenal.

0 (2h 14m 11s):
Ready Bang Wideman

2 (2h 14m 13s):
For timing. Oof. Good

0 (2h 14m 14s):
One. Yeah. Chris, he's fighting, fighting Anders soon. Eric

4 (2h 14m 16s):
Anders. Yeah. Eric Anders. Yeah.

2 (2h 14m 18s):
When is that?

4 (2h 14m 19s):
When is that? That's in Madison Square Garden. 16 November 16th. Ooh,

2 (2h 14m 23s):
That's a crazy fight. Yeah. I don't

0 (2h 14m 24s):
See, Chris is in South Carolina now. I don't, we don't see him so much in South Carolina. Chris. Now we gone. Is he,

2 (2h 14m 30s):
Is that with Wonderboy? Who's the training with down there? Has he lived down? I think he might

0 (2h 14m 33s):
Be.

4 (2h 14m 34s):
He's got like his own people with like Brian Barberino and those. He's got a bunch

0 (2h 14m 37s):
Of nice guy with

4 (2h 14m 38s):
T they got a decent little squad down there from Yeah. From what I hear.

2 (2h 14m 41s):
Well he was throwing kicks in the last fight. Yeah. Throwing hard kicks with that right leg.

4 (2h 14m 45s):
I can't watch it. It's crazy. I can't watch it. Yeah.

2 (2h 14m 47s):
But it seemed like he was trying to prove a point. Like, I'm not fucking roll these things. I'm gonna show

0 (2h 14m 51s):
You. He's such a, he's such a beast. Chris Whiteman.

2 (2h 14m 54s):
He, that last fight was a bummer though. The I poke thing was a real bummer. It

0 (2h 14m 57s):
It, it kind of made it Yeah. It, it

4 (2h 14m 59s):
Took away from it A little bit.

0 (2h 14m 59s):
Well, how do you wanted it?

2 (2h 15m 1s):
It was a bummer. I feel like I, I I keep saying it, but I feel like they should cover those fingertips. There's no reason why they're exposed. Doesn't make any sense. Do it like a bag glove cover it like a bag glove. Well,

4 (2h 15m 11s):
I mean, I just don't understand why, like, how they thought this was gonna solve the problem. They were like new gloves and it's, our guys are still getting poked in the eye. It's

2 (2h 15m 18s):
Yeah. It's still the same setup. Yeah. You know if you really want, like, I, I feel like for, if you're gonna have the fingerless ones, Trevor Witness Trevor Whitmans are the best. They're

4 (2h 15m 27s):
The best. They curve down, right? They curve

2 (2h 15m 29s):
Hard. Yeah. But your hands stay in this position. Like you have to struggle to do this. Right. Your hand naturally goes in this position. The U ffc gloves are still like this. Yeah.

4 (2h 15m 36s):
Like how did they think that was gonna be the answer?

2 (2h 15m 39s):
You gotta cover the fingers. There's no reason to not cover the fingers like a bag glove. Just have a a, a piece of leather that goes over the fingertips. So you have one thing. It's not gonna invade your grappling. It's not gonna change your striking. It's not gonna change anything for like a piece of elastic in there. Yeah. Yeah. Just keep it closed. And this way you at least if you get poked in the eye, you're getting a

0 (2h 15m 59s):
Blunt It's

2 (2h 15m 59s):
A bull. Yeah. Thing like this. You're not getting something that goes into your eyeball. Yeah. Right. So have 'em all covered with something like, and have like a ridge over the top of it, like a soft foam ridge. So even if you're getting poked in the eyes, you're not, you not, it's definitely better than a finger. Yeah. You're not getting an individual thing going deep into your eyeball with a fingernail, which is what people get right now. And sometimes get goes you fucking fingernails. Yeah. Dirt,

4 (2h 16m 21s):
Dirty ass fingernail in your eyeball.

2 (2h 16m 23s):
Even even if you trim your nails like my nails are trimmed. I wouldn't want that in my

0 (2h 16m 26s):
Asshole. Oh, let me look at me

2 (2h 16m 27s):
Today. Imagine if that's in your

0 (2h 16m 28s):
Asshole scratching

2 (2h 16m 30s):
Around inside your asshole. Right when your eyeball is just soft tissue man, boys.

0 (2h 16m 34s):
Yeah. It's worse than little ant man inside

2 (2h 16m 38s):
My head went straight there. Of course. Scarred. That's where I was going with it. It's like soft tissue in your eyeballs is the scariest soft tissue where we're allowing fingernails to go in there for no reason. You could fix that. You really could fix that by just covering the tips of the fingertips.

0 (2h 16m 53s):
I think you should just use Trevor Whitman's glove. Trevor

2 (2h 16m 56s):
Whitman's glove the best. Yeah, I do too. You're always gonna have thumbs You know. You remember Roberto Dur? Davey Moore? Fuck

0 (2h 17m 2s):
Y. Yeah. Yeah. Thumbed

2 (2h 17m 3s):
Him right in the eyeball.

0 (2h 17m 5s):
Dean Thomas,

2 (2h 17m 6s):
Roberto

0 (2h 17m 6s):
Duran. Do you want them to use the Trevor Whitman gloves? 'cause you feel bad about taking his fucking job. What? Listen, I can't help listen. No, he left, he left the job so he could work on them gloves. So you might as well give him the love.

2 (2h 17m 20s):
Trevor Whitman has the best gloves. Yeah, he has the best training gloves. He has the best,

0 (2h 17m 24s):
All his equipment is is top, top, top

2 (2h 17m 26s):
Tier. It's, he's just, he uses the best materials. Like the, the foam he uses is very different. It's like super high tech density foam. It feels better when you're hitting things. I think It would protect people from hand injuries better. Yeah. So

0 (2h 17m 38s):
They should talk to him.

2 (2h 17m 38s):
They did. He, he apparently he wanted some crazy amount of money that the UFC wasn't willing to do. Trevor.

0 (2h 17m 44s):
Oh, Trevor.

2 (2h 17m 45s):
Trevor. That's, that's the UFC's perspective. I don't know what Trevor, I love Trevor, but I'm a big fan of his stuff. It was, I, if it was up to me, I would figure out a way to make that work. Yeah, for sure. But You know, apparently he wanted like some something crazy.

0 (2h 17m 57s):
Something crazy. They're like, not only that D Thomas has you a fucking other job now, shit. So that's why you good job. But yeah. Yeah. You do much.

2 (2h 18m 7s):
Nobody dresses better.

0 (2h 18m 9s):
Yeah. Listen, that's, that's, I gotta, I got to man because like I'm working with y'all, you know what I'm saying? That's Joe Rogan at DC and now I gotta, I gotta have my own thing You. know what I'm saying? So you do

2 (2h 18m 18s):
Have a flare. You got your own Dean Thomas Flair? Yeah.

0 (2h 18m 21s):
I gotta, I gotta show up somehow. Shit. Hugh Hener always show up. Thomas. Hey,

2 (2h 18m 25s):
There's some good fights on this card this weekend. You know.

0 (2h 18m 27s):
Oh, I know. Definitely.

2 (2h 18m 28s):
Bob es is a bad

0 (2h 18m 30s):
Motherfucker. He is a bad motherfucker.

2 (2h 18m 31s):
That's a bad motherfucker. Yeah, that's, that's an interesting fight on the Undercard. Who's,

0 (2h 18m 35s):
Let's see,

2 (2h 18m 37s):
He's fighting Manuel Torres who's also good. Yeah, that's a good fight, man. That's a real good fight. They, they, it's one of them under the radar fights. They put people in here to like the throw most of these

0 (2h 18m 46s):
Cars. They

2 (2h 18m 47s):
Sure did.

0 (2h 18m 47s):
People like to throw man who the man with Tores fight this last fight. He beat the, he beat the hell outta somebody. Last

2 (2h 18m 51s):
Time he did Baja Menes throw some wild shit.

0 (2h 18m 57s):
Oh. yeah. Chris Duncan. Yeah. He busted Chris Duncan Oh. yeah.

2 (2h 19m 0s):
Yeah. This is a, that's gonna be an interesting fight. But for me, go scroll all the way up to the top, Jamie. No, no, no. The the, the end of the card. He's on the early. I'm very, very interested in the rematch of Alexa, Grasso and Valentina. Yes, me

0 (2h 19m 16s):
Too.

2 (2h 19m 17s):
I felt like Valentina did enough to get the nod in the second fight. I did too. I felt like she and some judge gave the last round to L Grosso. Ten eight had two points, which I thought was kind of, eh,

4 (2h 19m 29s):
Well you know why, right?

2 (2h 19m 30s):
Why I do that? Yeah. She had her in because

4 (2h 19m 31s):
He had her in a choke. Yeah, but, and like he was just kind of biased from the first choke.

2 (2h 19m 35s):
Right. But

4 (2h 19m 35s):
So he thought that was close enough.

2 (2h 19m 37s):
It was kind of close, but it wasn't You know. I mean it, it means something. if you didn't do that, you should do that all the time. Right. Times someone gets you in a choke and you defend that's a ten nine already. You already got a ten nine. Anything more than that Now it's ten eight You know like, like boxing with Knockdowns. Right, right. The scoring is too subjective.

5 (2h 19m 54s):
Ten eight round is more like when Al Jermaine had ya on his back the entire round. Right. Threatening You, know what I'm saying? Smashing

2 (2h 20m 1s):
Him, getting it

5 (2h 20m 1s):
At the end of the round doesn't earn the two point.

2 (2h 20m 4s):
Right. A ten eight is a dominant round You like you dominated the whole round

5 (2h 20m 8s):
And I don't even, did they give Al Jermaine two point like a, I don't even think he got ten eight for that.

0 (2h 20m 12s):
All I know is poor t know Al Joe didn't get the respect he deserves after that Calvin Kada fight, which was a fucking beautiful, it was on a fight

2 (2h 20m 19s):
Masterpiece.

0 (2h 20m 20s):
It was a, it was a great fight. and

2 (2h 20m 22s):
I think Al Joe is just a 45 er who was a bad motherfucker at 35. But I think we're gonna see the real Al Joe at 45.

4 (2h 20m 28s):
I think so too. I think he's gonna beat old boy in a couple weeks too. He's so big

2 (2h 20m 32s):
Man. Yeah. I was always like how the, I saw him in between fights

4 (2h 20m 35s):
Once he 1 76, he's gonna beat Moer in a couple weeks.

2 (2h 20m 38s):
Interesting fight.

5 (2h 20m 38s):
High level grappling.

2 (2h 20m 39s):
Yeah. Interested very high level. Back when he got San Hagen's back, bro. That was the quickness. Hell yeah. That rear naked choke of his is about as good as it gets in MMA right now.

5 (2h 20m 48s):
No doubt. These top three fights,

2 (2h 20m 50s):
Diego Lopez and Ortego is gonna be crazy. That's gonna be fucking crazy. How do

0 (2h 20m 54s):
You think or like what happened to Ortega last time where he pulled out like something was up with him,

5 (2h 20m 58s):
Supposedly he

2 (2h 20m 60s):
Weight

5 (2h 20m 60s):
Or something cut weight or something?

2 (2h 21m 0s):
Yeah, he got something real bad. Oh, okay. Yeah. He got real, real sick. I

0 (2h 21m 3s):
Threw it, I

2 (2h 21m 4s):
Threw, you know, he got real sick.

5 (2h 21m 5s):
So because they made that fight on, like I said it was a three week notice fight. Everybody

2 (2h 21m 9s):
Was gonna fight each each other. He didn't look good. The day of the weigh-ins, you know I do the interviews with fighters. I did an interview with him and he, he was like, he just looked tired. Oh. I think he just, I mean he didn't make weight that fight either. Remember missed weight.

5 (2h 21m 22s):
Yeah, it was, it was a medical withdrawal.

2 (2h 21m 23s):
Yeah. So he missed a weight. And then on top of that, like they, they changed the weight class then on top of that, he never makes it to the fight. He was sick. That's gonna be a wild fight. And Diego Lopez is a fucking assassin. Zell

4 (2h 21m 33s):
Hubbert is an assassin too. I was getting ready to,

5 (2h 21m 36s):
That's gonna be another

4 (2h 21m 37s):
Banger. He's good. Yeah.

5 (2h 21m 38s):
Who do You like who do You like on that one? I heard old Soto talking about Ovitz apparently trains at his gym. And obviously Rib

2 (2h 21m 46s):
Is good man. He good. He's very good. This is a very fun fight. Very fun fight. There's a lot of like under the radar fights on this card.

4 (2h 21m 54s):
I think it's gonna live up to it. I mean they got a lot of hype on the sphere. Yeah. And like the names may not be there, but all these guys are bangers.

2 (2h 22m 1s):
Here's the question, do they You know how they show, like on the big screens, you get to see the fights if you're in the stands. Like so you could see things that maybe you don't see. Are they gonna have it on the whole ceiling?

4 (2h 22m 11s):
That's what I, I

0 (2h 22m 12s):
Don't, I look it up and seeing shit You know

4 (2h 22m 14s):
Like that. I think they should. So I, I've been at the, I was at the Apex all week last week and like it's so secretive. Like everybody's

2 (2h 22m 21s):
Like, I think they should have the fight on the whole ceiling and then everybody would not know where to fuck

0 (2h 22m 24s):
To look's what I

5 (2h 22m 25s):
Think. Yeah.

2 (2h 22m 25s):
They'd be getting knockouts and people wouldn't even be looking at them and be like Oh.

0 (2h 22m 29s):
Yeah. Because

2 (2h 22m 30s):
If you, it's way cooler to, it's only gonna do it once, have the shit on the ceiling. Is

5 (2h 22m 34s):
It gonna be two production trucks? Like the pe like people at home aren't gonna be seeing the whole visual 'cause they're You know it's produced for.

2 (2h 22m 40s):
That's a very good point. Well

0 (2h 22m 41s):
Apparently they got, apparently they got like two, they hired another director. Like they Yeah. So it's like a senior director. Yeah. Like it's like

5 (2h 22m 50s):
Crazy. If they're smart, which they are, they should make some kind of documentary or something about the making of this shit. Oh they probably are. you know what I mean? And, and, and so people get this and try to see what was going on inside of there that weren't able to get tickets.

2 (2h 23m 3s):
I think there's six mini movies that play about the history of combat sports in

0 (2h 23m 6s):
Mexico. They said that Dana said something like that. Yeah. That's crazy.

2 (2h 23m 9s):
Crazy. See they spent $20 million in this fucking place. Yeah, I've heard it's nuts.

5 (2h 23m 14s):
I think what the original budget was 10.

0 (2h 23m 16s):
Wow. And they just went over.

2 (2h 23m 17s):
So Sean O'Malley and Marab is a perfect fight for it. Oh. yeah. I know that. Neither one of 'em is Mexican, but let that go for A. little bit. Well

0 (2h 23m 25s):
Mexican. No, no Mexico. They, they adopted Marab. It's true. So yeah, it's all good on

2 (2h 23m 30s):
That. He fights like a Mexican. He fights like a Mexican. He really does. God damn that guy's gas tank is terrifying. He's terrifying. 'cause that's a guy that if you empty out early on Moab, you got real pro You like the Marlon

0 (2h 23m 42s):
Maria bun. He's got a chin on him.

2 (2h 23m 44s):
He survives

5 (2h 23m 46s):
Apparently. So

2 (2h 23m 46s):
He fucking, the Marlon Marlon fight was nuts,

0 (2h 23m 49s):
Man. Yeah, it's funny about

5 (2h 23m 51s):
That. The second half of the round he got dropped then he beat him to death. Beat him to

0 (2h 23m 55s):
Death. I know he almost stopped once he

2 (2h 23m 57s):
Got on top. That's

5 (2h 23m 58s):
Why the second round happened. How it did? He just beat he took it out of him in the first round.

2 (2h 24m 2s):
Yeah, but Rob is an animal. But Marai was like a front runner like no other.

5 (2h 24m 6s):
No, you're right. That first round

2 (2h 24m 8s):
Was Henry Soto. I thought Henry Sudo was going to sleep. Yeah, right. Dude. When, when Marlon was in his prime, when he, when he knocked out Al Alga with that switch kick. It was crazy bro. He was terrifying. People forgot how good Marlon was. Mar was good. No,

0 (2h 24m 22s):
He was good. Good. But he just

2 (2h 24m 23s):
Was too big for the weight class too. He was, he was another guy then cutting a lot of weight. There's no way that was healthy. Right? He was so big for 35 and just switch

0 (2h 24m 32s):
Explosive man. Just, and then

5 (2h 24m 34s):
He had slick, he had that Mickey Mouse voice to go with it. So a little fire plug with that little

2 (2h 24m 38s):
Voice. Yep. What Marlin had that was so tricky was that left high kick off the front leg. He caught

5 (2h 24m 43s):
A lot of people.

2 (2h 24m 44s):
He did it so slick. It was so fast.

0 (2h 24m 46s):
Yeah. He was explosive. He was accurate. He was well-rounded. But he did the gas tank. I think maybe from making the weight or whatever

2 (2h 24m 53s):
It had to do with There was psychological aspects to it too. I think There was, was like something when he was the nail, it wasn't as You know. He just didn't stand up. He wasn't like Rab like Rab finds a fucking,

0 (2h 25m 5s):
Ah, there's a,

2 (2h 25m 5s):
There's a Georgia memory in there of some fucking street fight with a goat. He,

0 (2h 25m 12s):
You know, that's so

2 (2h 25m 14s):
Fucking,

0 (2h 25m 14s):
There's some deep

2 (2h 25m 15s):
Memory of some fucking chaotic thing on a mountain that happened that's in his brain

0 (2h 25m 19s):
Forever. You know You got Sean O'Malley saying that he has with goat. Sean Ley says he has no loss as he, he points out that Cheeto vera thing. That it's a fluke. if you look at Ma Robb's record, that fight with Frankie size was a fucking, I I don't say it often. It's a fucking robbery if you watch that. And, and, and he was just getting over fucking, what'd he have? Not in pneumonia. He had something, he had lingering effects or something and he still went through that fight and he, I don't give a fuck. Watch that fight. He won that fight. And then the other one with, with Simone Ricky Simone, it was controversial because he was in the choke and the, the round ended and then he was like half in, half out and they're like, oh, he is out.

0 (2h 25m 59s):
And then so it was a weird

2 (2h 26m 1s):
See the, I haven't seen that. Lemme see that Ricky Simon, I forgot about that

0 (2h 26m 5s):
Fight. He's shaken to the end of it. And then when it's end of it, it's like out but in and out. So it's like, it was a weird, but he made it to the belt.

2 (2h 26m 12s):
Well that's Jan Chaon against Jean. We Lee remember at the end of the round she was out cold Oh. yeah. Yeah. She, she was so unconscious. And then they woke her up and she was like, okay.

5 (2h 26m 22s):
She

0 (2h 26m 22s):
Walked corner,

2 (2h 26m 23s):
Sat down and throwing ice on her water.

0 (2h 26m 25s):
Massage Carlos,

2 (2h 26m 27s):
She woke up,

0 (2h 26m 28s):
Use

2 (2h 26m 28s):
Carlos Snoop, but he won because he was the first guy to wake up. Yeah. So here it is. Watch out. This Ricky Simone gets him in a, in a guillotine. And it is the very end.

0 (2h 26m 36s):
Oh my

2 (2h 26m 36s):
God. That's so nasty. Look how nasty that is. It's on too. It's so tight. It's so tight. He's out. He's out right there. He's

5 (2h 26m 42s):
Out the arm's hanging, but he doesn't stop.

2 (2h 26m 46s):
God's

0 (2h 26m 46s):
Still there. He's still shaking.

2 (2h 26m 48s):
Okay. So he's hanging in there. He's hanging in there. But

0 (2h 26m 51s):
Where's the second slip?

2 (2h 26m 52s):
He's not tapping. God damn. That guy's got willpower, huh? For real. Look at him. He's not tapping. Yo.

5 (2h 26m 57s):
He is adjusting

10 (2h 26m 58s):
For the moment. Still kicking those.

2 (2h 27m 1s):
He's not defending with his arms either. This is crazy. He's not even defending with his arms. He's just using his neck.

10 (2h 27m 7s):
Continue fight.

5 (2h 27m 8s):
He he's gave him the thumbs up.

2 (2h 27m 9s):
Yeah.

10 (2h 27m 12s):
Approaching 10,

5 (2h 27m 14s):
10 seconds.

10 (2h 27m 15s):
10 seconds. Keeps the bicycle churning.

2 (2h 27m 19s):
He's still moving. His legs fights.

5 (2h 27m 22s):
I I mean that's Where's

0 (2h 27m 23s):
The horn? The horn. But now he's like, he's not

2 (2h 27m 27s):
Out's. Okay. He's breathing. Yeah. What the fuck? They

0 (2h 27m 30s):
Stopped the fight. They

2 (2h 27m 31s):
Stop. No, no, no, no. You can't say he's out there. That's what I'm saying. He, he can't say he's out. So

0 (2h 27m 35s):
Rest in peace. Dr. Sherry. Right. That was the team doc,

5 (2h 27m 37s):
Dr. Wal and

2 (2h 27m 39s):
Yeah. That's kind of crazy. That's fucked up,

0 (2h 27m 42s):
Up

2 (2h 27m 42s):
The fight. Fucked up after the fight was over. Yeah, after the round was over, they decided he was out. Yeah. So

0 (2h 27m 47s):
I mean, so look, you could look at his record and say

2 (2h 27m 49s):
He protested immediately. He was just laying there with his eyes open and it looked like he was out because he was fucking exhausted. He could Be like, alright. Yeah, it's like a of relief. Relief. Like there's no way he would've known if the guy says it's over and he immediately protest There was no way he could have known to protest if he wasn't awake.

5 (2h 28m 7s):
And who was the ref? I don't even recognize

0 (2h 28m 9s):
Him in this. So it's like you could look at his record and be like, yo, this guy hasn't lost a fight.

2 (2h 28m 13s):
Yeah. There's some You know refs are human made mistakes.

0 (2h 28m 16s):
That's a rough one though. So it's like,

2 (2h 28m 17s):
It's a bad one.

0 (2h 28m 18s):
And, and if you look at the fight before that, that's the robbery of Frankie size. So you could literally look at this guy and say, he never lost. I mean, if you want to really,

2 (2h 28m 25s):
Well, I think all these moments of adversity just strengthened his resolve anyway. Oh. yeah. Because the guy's a monster now. Henry Soto fight was so crazy when he was carrying Henry Soto. Yeah. Like a little kid with his tongue hanging out. I was like, this is mad.

0 (2h 28m 39s):
It was kind of embarrassing. He used bad for Henry

2 (2h 28m 42s):
To Henry Kudo. He wasn't just doing it to some guy who didn't belong in the cage with him. He's doing it to a two division world champion who's Olympic gold medalist in wrestling. And he's carrying around like a pillow

0 (2h 28m 53s):
Slam. And he walks over to Mark Zuckerberg and Mark Zuck.

5 (2h 28m 57s):
And then he's talking shit while he's choking him

0 (2h 28m 59s):
Talking shit. Like

2 (2h 28m 60s):
He's having fun. The fuck outta him? He was having a great old time when he had him in that 10 finger guillotine. Man, bro, that's a nasty spot.

0 (2h 29m 6s):
That's a, that's

2 (2h 29m 7s):
A nasty. I thought he was gonna get him there with that. Yeah. I'm like, that's a nasty choke.

0 (2h 29m 11s):
Yeah. I think he's gonna have his night.

2 (2h 29m 13s):
I think the craziest moment like that though was when Hamza picked up the Leach Oh.

5 (2h 29m 18s):
Yeah. Walked, walked,

0 (2h 29m 19s):
Walked, gimme tighter shots. I killed him off. He he said carrying him in the air, just carrying

2 (2h 29m 26s):
Him over to Dana and he starts fucking him up right in front of Dana. That that dude's wild,

0 (2h 29m 32s):
Poor leach though. Like Leach can't catch. I mean they just feed him to every just fight. Yeah. Who did you just fight? Leach Carlos prs. Oh man. And Carlos prs put Carlos damn Carlos

2 (2h 29m 42s):
Smoking cigarettes in the locker room. Fucking everybody up.

0 (2h 29m 46s):
He's, he put that hands on that guy's that, that striking was beautiful.

2 (2h 29m 50s):
He's good. He made that look

0 (2h 29m 51s):
Easy, man.

2 (2h 29m 52s):
He's very, very, very good. That guy's scary. Where the fuck

0 (2h 29m 55s):
Did he come from? There's there so many, it's from, from the fighting nerds, man.

2 (2h 29m 58s):
He is right here. Yeah. Fighting nerds man. They got a great team. But this guy, he's just a fucking killer man. Carlos just knows how to put it on you. This knee of the body man was so nasty. Oh see the need of the body before that in the video. They didn't have that in in that video, but he had 'em hurt before this. But he's just fucking accurate dude.

0 (2h 30m 19s):
He's all limbs dude. Right?

2 (2h 30m 20s):
Oh,

0 (2h 30m 20s):
Look at that. He guys

5 (2h 30m 21s):
Are built like mosquitoes. I

0 (2h 30m 23s):
Hate those daddy mosquitoes. All legs in arms. Yeah. Yeah.

2 (2h 30m 27s):
There's some good fighters coming up, man. These kids that are coming up, they, they come into the cage so much better than guys just five years ago. I They're so much better.

0 (2h 30m 35s):
Well they're getting so much help from the UFC prior. Right. You know, like, especially like if you have like the PI behind You, like, like in Mexico, they're like sponsoring these these, they're sponsoring these guys

2 (2h 30m 45s):
Also. There's so many videos to watch now. Yeah. That's a big factor because like when you were coming up, you had VHS tapes. What the fuck are you gonna watch

0 (2h 30m 55s):
We? were trying wine and shit. Yeah.

2 (2h 30m 56s):
Really did Nobody got a chance to see anything. You didn't really get, unless you saw them in your gym, you didn't get a chance to see like real high level stuff. And now guys that have a standard in their head that's way higher than everybody's standard from 10, 15 years ago.

0 (2h 31m 10s):
It's true. Yeah. No doubt about that. This

2 (2h 31m 11s):
Guys just come in so well rounded. It evolved

5 (2h 31m 14s):
And plus up start so much younger

2 (2h 31m 16s):
Oh. yeah, that's a factor.

5 (2h 31m 17s):
And and kids, you know the UFC has boosted You know wrestling in high schools and junior leagues and things. So these, they're just more complete like they're com They're growing up now. Complete martial artists. You know there's

0 (2h 31m 28s):
No secrets anymore. I remember back in the day, he'd be like, it's a new move. Don't show anybody.

4 (2h 31m 34s):
Still

2 (2h 31m 34s):
The calf kicks only a few years old. That's what's Bis Bank said. He went his whole career without kick kicked in the cab. Me

0 (2h 31m 40s):
Too. Thank God. I crazy glad that, I'm glad that wasn't around. How the

2 (2h 31m 43s):
Fuck,

4 (2h 31m 43s):
How the

2 (2h 31m 44s):
Fuck did everybody miss that?

4 (2h 31m 45s):
I know, right?

2 (2h 31m 46s):
Benson Henderson used to throw

4 (2h 31m 47s):
It. He did. Used to. Yeah.

2 (2h 31m 48s):
Weird. But he never had the kind of results that these guys are having. It was, it's different. Where

5 (2h 31m 52s):
Did it come from? Like

2 (2h 31m 54s):
Muay Tie, part

5 (2h 31m 55s):
Of Muay Hai.

2 (2h 31m 55s):
They've always done. It just wasn't done that often because guys check it. I never noticed. And if they check it and they turn out and you catch it on your foot. I think they do it a lot more in Muay Thai now though. Because

4 (2h 32m 6s):
Even in Muay Hai.

2 (2h 32m 7s):
Yeah, I think everybody

4 (2h 32m 8s):
Just, I mean It would

5 (2h 32m 8s):
Makes sense

4 (2h 32m 9s):
When you

2 (2h 32m 9s):
See what's going on. Effectiveness, you see it in one a lot in glory. You see it now a lot guys throwing it a lot man. It's so effective. Well,

4 (2h 32m 17s):
You know, it's weird like in karate combat, like you can't throw it to the thigh. Like it has to be a calf kick. That's

2 (2h 32m 23s):
Ridiculous.

4 (2h 32m 23s):
Yeah, it's weird to me. I'm like, what? That's, it has to be a

2 (2h 32m 26s):
Calf kick. That's really ridiculous.

0 (2h 32m 28s):
Yeah. What do you mean you can't throw

4 (2h 32m 28s):
It to the thigh? You can't. It's illegal to kick above the knee. Why? In karate combat. That's

2 (2h 32m 33s):
Ridiculous. That's

5 (2h 32m 33s):
Silly. That no sense what come out with that. The whole point of karate. Yeah.

2 (2h 32m 36s):
That literally makes no sense. Yeah, because what about Khin? What about ones where they kick the legs all the time. That's karate too. Not

4 (2h 32m 43s):
Sure

2 (2h 32m 43s):
Why, you know, take out some of the best karate from karate.

4 (2h 32m 45s):
Not sure why that's a rule, but that's a

2 (2h 32m 47s):
Interesting, but you can ground and pound for like 10 seconds or something. You

4 (2h 32m 49s):
Can ground pound until you stop Oh. yeah. You can ground and pound until you stop and then then can't break it

2 (2h 32m 54s):
Up. But you can't leg kick. Right.

4 (2h 32m 56s):
But you can't kick to the

2 (2h 32m 58s):
Side. That, that seems crazy. Yeah, that doesn't make sense. What, what's your feeling on that sidekick to the knee? Like what Khalil did to Modesto's Hate it.

4 (2h 33m 5s):
No, I don't hate it. I love it. I I hate it. You hate it? Yeah.

5 (2h 33m 9s):
I think it does nothing but damage a fighter. Like people say, oh you can knee bar, well you can tap to a knee bar. You can't tap to that kick. And if the lands you're done can't

2 (2h 33m 19s):
Tap to a head kick either

5 (2h 33m 20s):
Kick. Yeah. I mean whatever about head. if you head go to sleep, you go to sleep. That's different to me.

2 (2h 33m 24s):
But some head kicks are probably worse than getting knee kicked. You know. I mean, Leon Edwards and Kama. if you ask Kama, would you rather take a shot to the knee or that shot to the head? He might take a shot to the knee. I don't know.

4 (2h 33m 36s):
Depends on

2 (2h 33m 36s):
On the how. I mean, you,

4 (2h 33m 37s):
You gotta be, you gotta

5 (2h 33m 37s):
Defend it. Right? if you hit on time like Khalil did, I think I'd rather get kicked in my head.

2 (2h 33m 42s):
That one was horrific. It's horrible to

4 (2h 33m 43s):
Watch but like you, you gotta defend it. Yeah. You know. It's not like you can't defend it. You gotta defend it.

2 (2h 33m 48s):
It's, you remember when Darren till started using it on everybody. He was like one of the first guys to start using it on everybody. John Jones, of course. Jones.

5 (2h 33m 54s):
Yeah. John Johns the, he's the guy with it. Yeah. And he's so long.

0 (2h 33m 59s):
Yeah, that's a shitty one that gets, I mean you

4 (2h 34m 1s):
Can't really, you can't use that full

5 (2h 34m 4s):
Force's in otherwise

2 (2h 34m 5s):
Other, there's spa you can't do me. No, you definitely can't, can't

4 (2h 34m 9s):
Do that in s sparring. You'd be taking out your penis

2 (2h 34m 10s):
Knees. You can't imagine. I've had guys tell me that they weres sparring guys they didn't know. And they did shit like that to them. Sidekicks the knees and I like, what the fuck are we doing now?

5 (2h 34m 17s):
A real fight.

0 (2h 34m 18s):
Now you're making a street

2 (2h 34m 18s):
Fight in a, in a sparring match. The guy was telling me about the, at t they bringing in some crazy Russians. There was sidekick in your knees. I mean,

4 (2h 34m 25s):
Not only that, but they was doing like spinning wheel kicks to the, to the head with just, he hitting you with the heel. And I'm like, yo, what are you doing?

2 (2h 34m 31s):
That's crazy. Yeah. That's crazy. Yeah. That's so hard to, that's so hard. If you're in a high level sparring match with a guy where it's like you're getting emotional and then you throw a spinning kick, it's so hard to like slap him with the foot hard.

0 (2h 34m 43s):
Well, I'm just saying like,

2 (2h 34m 43s):
It's so hard to decide to use the foot.

4 (2h 34m 45s):
Well you wear, you wear Shimp pad for a reason to protect, but then you're throwing a spinning kick where there's no protection. Well

2 (2h 34m 50s):
That's why gloves are nuts. Right? because you can knee somebody in the face, you can elbow in the face, you can shin them in the fucking skull. Right. But, but your knuckles are covered. But God

4 (2h 34m 59s):
Forbid Right. It's kind of crazy. Yeah. This is kind of crazy. It's kind of

0 (2h 35m 4s):
Crazy. I never once bared with the new, I mean they came later on like the, the, the gloves that you could, they're not quite, they're not the boxing gloves. The

4 (2h 35m 12s):
Bigger

2 (2h 35m 13s):
Puff, they're bigger

4 (2h 35m 15s):
Practice seven gloves. Yeah.

0 (2h 35m 16s):
Yeah. I always use the 16 ounce gloves. 'cause I wanna be able to fucking throw and I grapple in them. But then like you, I'd get in, I get under the butt. You obviously can't make a, a grip, but then it's that much easier when I can make a grip. So like I get in, I, I'd lose it, but It would help my endurance. And when I'm be able to make grips, I'm like, ah, when they add the new gloves and people are fucking around with 'em, I'm like, yeah, but now we gotta just, now we're playing. I I I didn't have the luxury. I'm fucking five six. I have to triple jab in and fight. Like I can't play by just, I have to have to throw. So I couldn't throw like, like realistically with those little gloves. Right. So when I see sometimes there's some people sparring. I had one my girl sparring and, and this girl Lauren and, and she brought in another girl and they were doing it with those gloves.

0 (2h 35m 57s):
I go look, next time if you want me to watch this shit you're playing right now. I can't, I'm not gonna be telling you to fucking do certain things and throw certain things. if you be, it's playing, you're playing. It's okay to play or grab. I like to grapple in them, but we have to fight. So I mean, You know put on some bigger a gloves. I

4 (2h 36m 13s):
Mean we did the

2 (2h 36m 14s):
Same thing. Do you think that there's a time in a fighter's career where they don't have to spar? Is there ever a time where they don't have to spar hard?

0 (2h 36m 22s):
If they clock in enough hours, like I guess like Max Holloway, whoever else like Right.

2 (2h 36m 27s):
Possibly. But even Holloway, when he is getting ready for Gaethje decided to spar,

0 (2h 36m 31s):
You have to saw the results. You have to simulate the fight as much as possible because you don't wanna feel that for the first time in there. So the reason we used to really spar

2 (2h 36m 38s):
Asking is 'cause like I was watching Izzy's fight with DKAs and the thing about that fight is that it looks like at the end Izzy's very tired You know. Yeah. And he gets clocked like trick is catches him with some of those winging punches, which he was getting away from or in the earlier rounds. And he catches 'em, rocks 'em, and then he hits him with a couple more Right. Hands against the cage and then immediately gets 'em in a choke when it goes to the ground. And then Izzy taps and I always wonder, 'cause that school of thought of like the Marinovich school of thought when BJ was in his prime Yeah. Was those guys were just doing wild plyometrics and cardio and that's it. They just like You know how to fight. Right. We're just gonna give you the most fucking insane gas tank you've ever had in your career.

2 (2h 37m 21s):
And if you can get through this crazy camp of doing box jumps and plyometrics and those fucking, all those things they were doing with their feet, throwing 'em with their feet, their the system's. Wild, wild shit. And Nick Sson, who I talked about, yeah. He is trained under Yeah. He's doing it now. They have this philosophy that a fighter, like a guy like you or a guy like you, you're, you have so many fights. You know how to fight. You've been there, you've done it. What you really need to do for this camp, 'cause you're getting ready for a fight, is not get injured and have a fucking insane gas tank. The

0 (2h 37m 51s):
Flip side of that, most recently, and it's not the same thing 'cause the guy could be weathered A little bit who had that philosophy with Tony Ferguson. Goggins. Yeah. Goggins put him Now look.

2 (2h 38m 3s):
Yeah. But that's Tony Ferguson after Gaje.

0 (2h 38m 6s):
But Goggins put him through a fucking, a cardio sessions. Like I

2 (2h 38m 10s):
Think Tony Ferguson after Gage, he's a different human being. Yeah. He's been compromised and also and I like

0 (2h 38m 14s):
David Goggins. But I don't, I mean I I don't think he should have been in the corner. I mean, you got him in the corner yelling from the stand. I I'm not shitting on Goggins. I, I like all the shit. But he's in the corner going, get up Tony. It's like, it's one of those things where it's like You know no shit. Agreed.

2 (2h 38m 27s):
Agreed. Look, when it comes to willpower and when it comes to like discipline, there's no one like Goggins. But that doesn't matter if you mount him and strangle him today. Yeah. It doesn't matter you all that. I fucking never quit. You're gonna quit bitch. Yeah. I'm gonna make your body quit.

4 (2h 38m 43s):
I'm make your body quit. I

2 (2h 38m 44s):
Sleep. What kind of will you have? I get behind you and put that in there. You're going night, you sleep, you're gonna pee your pants. That's how it goes. You're a human being. Yeah. You, you have neck muscles, you have veins that provide all that blood to your brain. And I'm gonna cut that off and if, if you can't get all that he needs from a guy like that, but you can get something. You can get something. But Tony at that time was already on a long skid of multiple losses. The Chandler knockout, he gets front kicked in the face and an epic K loss. Yeah. The Gaje fight was horrific. And then you gotta go before that he blows his fucking knee out backstage. Oh. yeah. He was the boogeyman. We were gonna see the Boogieman versus Khabib.

2 (2h 39m 24s):
It was the fight. Everybody was pumped. Yeah. And then Al steps in on super short, raging Ally. Aquin raging Al had a great fucking account of himself. Big time. It was a very good fight. Big time's. Very good. Fight against Kabib

0 (2h 39m 37s):
Was before I was noticed. That was

2 (2h 39m 39s):
Four hours. Khabib and his prime. Yeah.

0 (2h 39m 42s):
Alt get finished for five rounds.

2 (2h 39m 44s):
Bro. I always wonder man if Tony Ferguson just doesn't step on those wires and we get to see that fight. My God. How? Yeah. 'cause that was Tony Ferguson when he was the fucking boogeyman when everybody was scared of him. Yep. He was beating the fuck out of everybody. Who's

4 (2h 39m 57s):
The guy that left them wires there? Hopefully they fired that guy because he ruined his, he ruined

2 (2h 40m 1s):
History. There's always gonna be wires. Yeah. It's just a thing. You didn't random fucking camera fall backstage or something too. Yes. Right before the fight he fell and hit his head. Remember? I remember he stepped on some like loose pipe pipe or something went up in the air, banged his head, got knocked out, was bleeding.

0 (2h 40m 16s):
Yeah. Everybody terrible. Everybody's always gonna be guessing. But like even when he was in his prime, like he fought Kevin Lee. Kevin Lee got him down, mounted him,

2 (2h 40m 24s):
But then he triangled him.

0 (2h 40m 25s):
He, he did triangle him. But Kevin Lee mounted You know offense to Kevin Lee. It's not like a beeb on top of you. So I mean is he ever surviving that?

2 (2h 40m 32s):
You gotta remember Kevin Lee maybe didn't achieve his potential but Kevin Lee choke out Kisa. Remember that Kevin Lee was a motherfucker on the

4 (2h 40m 40s):
Ground. Yeah. He had ground had his moments. He did have his moments. He had his, he had his moments.

2 (2h 40m 43s):
He had mad potential. Yeah. When he knocked out. What's his face? The wrestler.

4 (2h 40m 47s):
Oh, Gregor s

2 (2h 40m 49s):
Greg.

0 (2h 40m 50s):
That was

2 (2h 40m 52s):
The hype train

0 (2h 40m 52s):
There. No, Kevin Lee.

2 (2h 40m 53s):
Kevin Lee was a fucking beast man. He just was inconsistent and then had a bunch of knee injuries. Like severe knee injuries.

4 (2h 40m 59s):
And that's the thing, like a fighter's window is only open for so long. Right. So you gotta try to maximize that. Do what you can when your window is open. Right.

2 (2h 41m 6s):
If you saw Fed or fight Ryan Bader, you can't, you can't judge Fedor on that.

4 (2h 41m 11s):
Right. And that's, we tend to do that. Definitely

2 (2h 41m 12s):
Not. We always do. We judge B, that's why I always say bj 'cause we judge BJ by the end of his career

0 (2h 41m 17s):
It was like Tony Ferguson. I mean I think Tony beat that beat. BJ's. It's not a good record that Ray have but as far as how many losses in a row. In a

2 (2h 41m 24s):
Row. Yeah. Yeah.

0 (2h 41m 25s):
So these guys gotta throw these guys' names in Fight, pass the all these young kids and see them in their glory days. 'cause that's when you should really watch them. Yeah.

2 (2h 41m 32s):
You know. But it's, that's the thing about fighters is like whatever that window is, they say it's nine years at your very best. From your contender to your champion. Whatever you fucking red lining. Ba

4 (2h 41m 44s):
I think it's about five really. You know. Right. I think it's, I think it's shorter than nine. I think it's about five years. Where you're just like in it. Like you in it. Let's get it

2 (2h 41m 52s):
Right now. Like Anderson. Yeah. Anderson is prime. Yeah. Right. It's like five years of just destruction

4 (2h 41m 57s):
And then afterwards it's like Oh. yeah man. It's not

2 (2h 41m 60s):
Got it no more. Also injuries, you know with Anderson injuries. Well first it was Weidman. Yeah. Weidman's left Hook You know

4 (2h 42m 6s):
That was, that was the start of it all. Yep. The Wyman's left hook

2 (2h 42m 9s):
Bro. That was crazy. Crazy. Such a crazy left hook. Real crazy. Same when he landed on Uriah Hall, remember?

4 (2h 42m 13s):
Yep. Oh. yeah.

2 (2h 42m 14s):
Before Uriah Hall was like the next big thing when he was in the Ultimate Fighter, Chris had fought him in New Jersey Combat. Yep. Lou Neglia bro. He had a long left hook. Wyman's got that. That extra foot to that hook. You know it was a long hook. That was, that was awesome. Shit. Like an extended arm hook at

4 (2h 42m 31s):
The end sometimes. Go go gadget left

2 (2h 42m 33s):
Hook. Yeah. It's a good hook man. Because the guys don't think it's gonna be able to reach him and then all of a sudden it's there. Pop.

0 (2h 42m 38s):
I'm interested to see him in Eric Anders. It's gonna be a war. Yeah. 'cause Eric's

4 (2h 42m 43s):
A tough guy to too. He's game. Yeah. Eric is game.

2 (2h 42m 45s):
But remember when we fought Khalil and didn't even flinch and Khalil was just blasting his legs talking

4 (2h 42m 50s):
About being tough enough to take a beating like

2 (2h 42m 53s):
Bro. I asked him about it. I was like, what was that like? I said every one of 'em hurt everyone. They hurt so bad.

4 (2h 42m 59s):
Good poker face bro. He had

2 (2h 43m 0s):
A best Boca for

4 (2h 43m 1s):
Real

2 (2h 43m 1s):
Man. Shit. He just took it.

0 (2h 43m 3s):
Yeah.

2 (2h 43m 4s):
Some good fights coming up kids, some real good fights.

0 (2h 43m 6s):
Oh fuck yeah. I can't wait. I, I love it. I love a Saturday when the fight I, I hate when there's, there's so many fights on every weekend that when there's not one on, I'm like, oh

2 (2h 43m 15s):
You know what I'm looking forward to more than any Holloway and por. Yeah.

0 (2h 43m 19s):
What

2 (2h 43m 20s):
Is that? That's the one for me. When is that?

4 (2h 43m 22s):
That's October.

2 (2h 43m 23s):
October. That's Abu Dhabi right? Yeah.

4 (2h 43m 24s):
October 6th.

2 (2h 43m 25s):
That's the one son. That's 2020 sixth. That's the one for me. 'cause I see that fight. I go, I don't fucking know. I don't, I love a fight where I don't fucking know. I know a lot of people would've counted out ga him on the Gaje fight shit.

5 (2h 43m 39s):
I thought Gaje was

2 (2h 43m 40s):
Gonna beat him insane. And now you're giving him a lot of time to prepare and get ready for this fight. Sh And then Hamson Whitaker. Is that gonna happen?

0 (2h 43m 49s):
This this people, I

2 (2h 43m 51s):
Don't dunno. Is that gonna happen? You know

5 (2h 43m 52s):
If he's not sick again.

2 (2h 43m 53s):
Gotta open.

0 (2h 43m 54s):
This is a nice fucking card though.

2 (2h 43m 55s):
It's a great card. It is a good card.

0 (2h 43m 58s):
Neil and I Deto. I didn't know that was happening.

2 (2h 44m 2s):
Arm and Petrosian and Mag Meadow Oh. yeah. That's some good fights on that card. Yeah, they, they bust out anybody. That's a great Don on that card.

4 (2h 44m 14s):
Yeah.

0 (2h 44m 15s):
Get in there. Yeah, get in there. Come on bro.

2 (2h 44m 19s):
That main event is, that main event is so unpredictable. Like por everybody hits goes night night. I know everybody he hits, he's fucking

0 (2h 44m 28s):
Max is hard to hit. Very

4 (2h 44m 30s):
Hard. And Max got Chin

2 (2h 44m 32s):
On. Max got the chin Max got gas tank. That new sneaky spinning back kick while he's stepping away. It was

5 (2h 44m 37s):
Working. Right.

0 (2h 44m 38s):
That might have been a game changer

2 (2h 44m 39s):
Man. It's a game changer

0 (2h 44m 40s):
That landed at the end of that first round.

2 (2h 44m 42s):
Smashed the

5 (2h 44m 43s):
To change the fight.

2 (2h 44m 44s):
Changed the fight. Changed the fight. Changed the fight. And it was a skill that he really didn't use a lot earlier in his career. Yeah. No. And he had it all of a sudden dialed in

0 (2h 44m 51s):
B It was

2 (2h 44m 53s):
Crazy and it was a, a hard one to do 'cause he's moving away. It was like a hop away spin to the face

0 (2h 44m 59s):
And talk about a hero fucking ending to that fucking wow. You can't, I don't think there's another fight that ended like You like

2 (2h 45m 5s):
Wouldn't believe that if it was in a movie. Yeah. Like shut up. Right. Shut up with your stupid,

0 (2h 45m 10s):
A fight that is clearly ahead. He fucking takes that chance of

2 (2h 45m 14s):
Clearly ahead. Yeah. With

5 (2h 45m 16s):
A guy, you know, throws hammers. Yeah.

2 (2h 45m 18s):
You know, and he's been dropped in that fight already. Right. He got

0 (2h 45m 21s):
Dropped the way he ended with face planted.

2 (2h 45m 23s):
Oh. It's just stuff of legends Oh. yeah. And the fact that it's for the BMF belt. What a perfect fight for the BM F Belt. That's a real

5 (2h 45m 30s):
BF belt. That's the perfect fight. Hundred

0 (2h 45m 31s):
Percent. No, a hundred percent.

4 (2h 45m 32s):
And it's crazy 'cause like I'm sitting right behind you guys and I'm watching you guys' like natural reactions, like it's such a natural reaction. and I, I know you guys take a lot of shit and they make memes about you guys, but watching you do it in those moments is the best thing ever. Yeah.

2 (2h 45m 46s):
You don't even know what's happening. Yeah. I think that was the first fight I ever stood up. I got outta my chair, I couldn't take it.

0 (2h 45m 51s):
And You like, it's like,

2 (2h 45m 52s):
Oh I couldn't, I literally couldn't take it. I couldn't take it. I couldn't, I can't be sitting down. I had to stand up Anek too and doesn't stand up very often either. I don't think. I couldn't, I couldn't sit down. I was like, I can't believe I just saw that. I can't believe that was real. Yeah. And then when Max walking around

4 (2h 46m 9s):
Going Rah

2 (2h 46m 11s):
Was fucking wild, man. That was wild.

4 (2h 46m 14s):
Max be giving us some moments, right? Oh, oh God. He gave us some moments. God, God. He might be my all time favorite friend.

0 (2h 46m 18s):
Myself and Dean Thomas. Were there. Not a lot of people were there alive. It was, I think it was in Abu Dhabi

4 (2h 46m 23s):
When he ca and he's looking away. He's like, I'm the best box him in the face. I him,

2 (2h 46m 29s):
I still gave him the second fight with Vul Kovski. So you

4 (2h 46m 33s):
Thought hundred

2 (2h 46m 34s):
Percent think imagine if he wins and then he doesn't go through this skid You know. And you see, oh, the Calvin Cader fight was brutal. He changed Calvin CA's career

4 (2h 46m 42s):
Spark.

2 (2h 46m 43s):
He changed Calvin C's career in that fight. That was a bad beating. It was a bad beating and it was kind of

4 (2h 46m 49s):
Should've never talked shit to him.

2 (2h 46m 53s):
And this is the Apex, right?

4 (2h 46m 55s):
No, this is Abu Dhabi.

2 (2h 46m 56s):
Oh, that's right. No, but no audience. Right, right. That's

4 (2h 46m 58s):
Why, oh look at he's not even looking at him and avoiding all the punches. The best landed another.

2 (2h 47m 8s):
But it, the other thing about Max too is that fucking gas tank. That gas tank is

4 (2h 47m 12s):
Weapon. He doesn't, he doesn't,

2 (2h 47m 13s):
It's a weapon. Doesn't it's a weapon man. The volume in the gas tank, it's a weapon. It's wild. And that power's legit too. And Max seems to be even more powerful at 55 than he is at 45. That's what I thought. So, but my question is does he maintain that when he gets down to 45, like how hard's that cut, especially

4 (2h 47m 31s):
When he up 55. Well he's got, he's got plenty of time to kind of Right. Time it out. Right. But so I think it's gonna help him.

2 (2h 47m 36s):
I hope so. I would not want see him drained at all. Yeah. If he's fighting ia.

4 (2h 47m 41s):
Because IA will expose you.

0 (2h 47m 43s):
Has he? Well,

4 (2h 47m 44s):
His hands,

2 (2h 47m 45s):
I know you see the video of him hitting in mitts.

4 (2h 47m 48s):
I, I saw his, even his brother hit like that. Really? I watched his brother hit MITs and I was like, god damn

2 (2h 47m 54s):
Bro. He hits mitts like a world champion boxer. Yeah.

4 (2h 47m 56s):
Pop, pop,

0 (2h 47m 57s):
Pop, pop. and I was gonna say, we haven't seen the other guy tested ia. But then again in his

4 (2h 48m 1s):
Opening fight did Harbert, he got

2 (2h 48m 4s):
Head kicked, got dinged

4 (2h 48m 5s):
He got, and he came back

0 (2h 48m 6s):
Like a fucking beast that that's

2 (2h 48m 8s):
Something to say. And stopped him in the next round. Yeah. Yeah. But Ilya's hands are some of the most impressive hands in the sport. It so no fat in his technique. No wasted movements

0 (2h 48m 17s):
Man. Well then we see he was

4 (2h 48m 18s):
The best boxer I was getting ready to say. You're gonna find out

2 (2h 48m 20s):
This is good Jamie, but there's a video that's like recently on his Instagram that's fucking insane because he's going full clip trying to show off and you get to really, like he's working here. It's all good. But see if you can find the clip that's on his Instagram page. His Instagram has a, an insane video of him just cracking MITs. We played it on the podcast the other day. Remember? I, I just didn't know. I mean, yeah, that's it right there. Gimme some volume so you can hear this shit bro.

4 (2h 48m 52s):
Yeah, that's clean, that's crispy. Clean everything.

2 (2h 48m 57s):
No wasted motion man.

4 (2h 48m 58s):
But here's the thing with with Max is Max's movement. Oh? yeah. Like Max ain't gonna be there for that. Nope. Yeah. Max is tall. Can't be there for that Tall. Yeah Tall.

2 (2h 49m 5s):
Tall as fuck. Yeah. Yeah. And if Max can catch him and hurt him the way Ja Herbert did you know

4 (2h 49m 9s):
Max.

2 (2h 49m 10s):
Max with something sneaky and You know Max is prepping right? Yeah. He's watching that guy like a hawk.

0 (2h 49m 14s):
Does Koski have anything else on the radar?

2 (2h 49m 17s):
No, I think they're waiting to see what happens. I think Poor Volk.

5 (2h 49m 22s):
I mean I personally like to see him rest A little bit anyway. You know

2 (2h 49m 25s):
I would 100% wanna see him rest a lot. I think after those two he should have two at least never taken a 10, 10 days notice. Fight with Islam. Agree. Never, never, never, never, never. Don't do it. I don't care how much it's tempting. And then immediately three months later he fights por after he gets killed with a head kick. That seems crazy. Shit.

5 (2h 49m 44s):
You mean I wish you, I mean I thought that as soon as I saw that fight I was like, oh are you kidding me man, he fight there no way he's

0 (2h 49m 50s):
Gonna be recovered. He was a round with him. He was probably, you know, before that he probably felt like, you know, I felt it before I felt it. I've seen what's coming. You know he took a risk.

5 (2h 49m 58s):
Oh I look, I don't begrudge him for taking that shot. I think the second fight was even the bigger mistake because you had just been flatlined and now you gotta cut back down and go back out there on such short notice. Right.

2 (2h 50m 10s):
But no other sport would want a champion to go in there and fight for a title with 10 days notice. They would never ask you to do that anywhere else. There's never, that would never happen in boxing. It's never gonna happen in million years in boxing for sure. Never. But You

4 (2h 50m 24s):
Know they take a and it shouldn't, they take advantage of MMA guys 'cause they know we crazy.

2 (2h 50m 27s):
Right. That's part of it.

5 (2h 50m 29s):
Plus's still under also you have all the fighters are still under your control, under contract. So You know

2 (2h 50m 35s):
It's a bit of a problem. You know that's a bit of a problem. And, but also Ul Kovski could have, he, he had the choice. He just like, he's a warrior,

5 (2h 50m 42s):
He's a savage. He's gonna go

2 (2h 50m 43s):
Do it. Yeah. He's a savage. We crazy. Felt he could do it crazy. Yeah.

4 (2h 50m 46s):
In hindsight was a bad idea. But in his mind he's thinking this is an opportunity for me to become a legend. Yeah,

5 (2h 50m 51s):
Of course.

0 (2h 50m 52s):
Right. Hindsight's always 2020 trying

5 (2h 50m 53s):
Of his legacy.

2 (2h 50m 54s):
Of course. And look, that's what Aspenal did. He won the title. Right.

4 (2h 50m 58s):
Exactly. So same shit. Had that been different for Aspenal, we would've been like, yo, he shouldn't have took that fight.

2 (2h 51m 2s):
Exactly. Like Pavlov, that guy's an animal. Yeah. Why is, how's he fighting Pavlich with fucking, what did he have? Like how many days notice did he have? It

4 (2h 51m 11s):
Was like seven days. Seven

2 (2h 51m 12s):
Days notice and a fucked up rib couldn't wrestle.

4 (2h 51m 14s):
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

2 (2h 51m 16s):
It's a wild sport. You know, it's like sometimes guys step in on short notice and it's exciting and they win. You know. So it's like the key is like never get outta shape. Yeah. and I think with Kinski, he was drinking a lot and You

4 (2h 51m 30s):
Know that was probably more so didn't think problem

5 (2h 51m 31s):
Coming. I mean you saw physically how he looked for the second of his

2 (2h 51m 34s):
Long. He looked fight You know. And he always looks like a tank.

5 (2h 51m 36s):
It was dad bo instead of him You know looking. Right.

0 (2h 51m 39s):
I would never take it back in the day too. I, I need my camp. I'm not gonna, I would never, because you peak at the right, you should be peaking at the right time. 100%. So you can say when people are like, well you should always be fight ready, but Yeah. But that's, that's easier said than done. You could always be in shape. Yeah. But that's not fight shape. And you don't know that until you're fucking back into Sparr and then you're like, ah, I thought I thought had abs. But holy

5 (2h 52m 0s):
Fuck. I think if you're always about four weeks out, like that's probably about the

2 (2h 52m 4s):
Right. Yeah. Right. And you get 10 days notice, you're

5 (2h 52m 7s):
Able pull it out shit You know what I mean?

2 (2h 52m 8s):
You might be able to pull that out and if you maintain a respectable level of cardio Yep. But if you're vol and you're drinking, getting it in cheeseburgers,

0 (2h 52m 16s):
Not again, not a good idea.

2 (2h 52m 17s):
And then you gotta lose all that fucking weight. Yeah.

0 (2h 52m 19s):
I can. I used to be a fatty between shit too. So when you, when you're staying away from the pizza and pasta for two months, you're like, ah,

2 (2h 52m 26s):

2 (2h 52m 53s):
Fuck brother. That Bobby Green fight was a big deal. That was a big

0 (2h 52m 56s):
Deal. And that was, that was about his, yeah,

2 (2h 52m 58s):
That was a big deal.

0 (2h 52m 58s):
I didn't, I didn't, the way he did that was beautiful, man. Kicked, kicked him a kicking range. Yep. and I didn't expect Bobby to shoot, but the second he did, Pat's got nice juujitsu. Yeah.

2 (2h 53m 7s):
Very sharp off his back. And the other thing was like, you notice how big he looked. 'cause Bobby's big. I know Bobby's not a small 50 fiver. Right. And you know, like, damn, like he might underestimate how big Pat is at 55. He's fucking pretty big. And those kicks were good,

0 (2h 53m 21s):
Man. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. He's not, he's not a bad fighter, but Bobby's

2 (2h 53m 24s):
A very good standup fighter for sure. Should Bobby get his legs lit up that quick? Dude, that was a big deal.

5 (2h 53m 29s):
I expected to see him get tested and it, he didn't, wasn't tested at

2 (2h 53m 32s):
All. Well he got an A plus. Yeah. Handle it. But do you think he's ready for like the top guys now? Like do, would you put him in there with an arm and Ian You? know what I'm saying?

Oh, that's a good fight. Yeah. Yeah. Winner

0 (2h 53m 48s):
Morano.

5 (2h 53m 49s):
Morano

0 (2h 53m 49s):
Baby. Yeah. Put him in there for one of them guys. I would love to see him fight Murano. I like Murano's Been going more with his juujitsu lately. Yeah. Oh. yeah. Murano's got really good jitsu. I saw him. That's what I'm saying. I saw him ball up Chase hoop in a grappling tournament. Yeah. Ooh.

2 (2h 54m 3s):
Ball him up. And how good is that fucking post-fight interview? Oh

0 (2h 54m 6s):
Man, he's the best. Nothing is better than kidding me. My fucking money. He's funny. He's,

2 (2h 54m 10s):
He's on his podcast.

5 (2h 54m 11s):
He's funny. Like his guy's a character all of a sudden. Like he's good.

2 (2h 54m 14s):
All this. Well, he figured it out, man. You know. Some guys figured it out. Like Colby had it figure it out. Right. That's right. He did it his way. Everybody figures it out. You figure out you gotta get people

0 (2h 54m 23s):
Out. Being t Kobe's taught own way. No, but Yeah, but there's certain things. But that's his, once you get into fam, listen, the second he spoke about Leon Edwards dead father, it shows you that he's a, he's a fucking piece of shit. Kobe. You're a fucking piece of shit, dude.

5 (2h 54m 41s):
I'm down for none of that. The, you don't,

0 (2h 54m 42s):
Connor

5 (2h 54m 43s):
Was talking about po ER's wife, like come on

2 (2h 54m 45s):
Man. Man. Well that's why

5 (2h 54m 46s):
It's like, I'm finding you on a street.

0 (2h 54m 47s):
I couldn't fight nowadays. Yeah.

2 (2h 54m 48s):
That's, that's why it's so interesting that a guy like prayer gets his high as he gets with none of that zero.

0 (2h 54m 55s):
Well, I mean, it's proof that you don't need it. You don't need, you don't, you don't need to cross that

2 (2h 54m 59s):
Line. You just need to fuck people up. You don't even need to speak English.

5 (2h 55m 3s):
He got a good social media presence though. Like he shows a sense of humor in You, know what I mean? Right. On social media. So I think that endears people to him as

2 (2h 55m 10s):
Well, bro. And that thing he did when he kicked the soccer ball and then hit it with an arrow Oh.

4 (2h 55m 14s):
Yeah. Yeah. That was

2 (2h 55m 15s):
Crazy hard. That is to do. Yeah. Wait, what did he do? He kicked a soccer ball and then shot it with an arrow, so he kicks it. Oh,

0 (2h 55m 22s):
He really shoots arrow ropes. Yes. I thought he was just fucking

2 (2h 55m 24s):
Around. No, no. He's really good man. He's really good at that dude. That

0 (2h 55m 27s):
Guy's right outta the Amazon, that motherfucker. But

2 (2h 55m 29s):
He does that kind archery. I don't even do that kind of archery. He, I do archery with like releases and fucking, everything's like this. Wha He nails it and that's before he beat Ade Sonja. Listen, gimme some volume on this. 'cause when he screams, imagine being the neighbor and hearing this here. He hits it.

0 (2h 55m 48s):
Imagine

2 (2h 55m 49s):
Being the neighbor

0 (2h 55m 51s):
Calling 9 1 1 right away. Yeah.

4 (2h 55m 54s):
Get this guy outta here.

0 (2h 55m 56s):
And then,

2 (2h 55m 57s):
And then you watch him on Pay-per-view and like, oh, Jesus Christ. You can't even complain. Mm. You can't even say, Hey man, I'm trying

0 (2h 56m 2s):
To take a nap. It's

5 (2h 56m 3s):
Fun. That's pretty sick.

0 (2h 56m 5s):
Yeah. Some guys don't need it. They don't need that extra fucking, whatever it is. You know. Well,

2 (2h 56m 10s):
He's got the swag with him is just the stoic warrior coming out and shooting Arrow at you and screaming You know. Well,

4 (2h 56m 16s):
I mean, at the end of the day, like people are attracted to violence. Yeah. And at the end, like even Robbie Lawler, like people love Robbie and he never said he hated doing an interview. Hundred percent. It was violence that attracted people to hundred

5 (2h 56m 28s):
Percent. Talking about wars. Him and both Rory McDonald fights. Oh my God. Him and Carlos condo. Oh my God. Right.

2 (2h 56m 35s):
Him and Melvin. Man, hoof. Remember that

0 (2h 56m 37s):
Oh?

4 (2h 56m 37s):
Yeah. His leg

5 (2h 56m 39s):
A one way ass whip until he uncorked

0 (2h 56m 42s):
Him a

2 (2h 56m 43s):
Fucking bomb.

5 (2h 56m 45s):
That was crazy. He was kicking Robbie's leg so bad. It was lifting. It was nuts. His leg up in the air, he's

0 (2h 56m 50s):
Probably having flashbacks of pizza. Rat Oh. yeah,

4 (2h 56m 52s):
That's right. Oh. yeah.

5 (2h 56m 54s):
Remember that peach

2 (2h 56m 54s):
Prt? You forgot about pizza Pratt.

5 (2h 56m 56s):
He was a good striker.

2 (2h 56m 57s):
Very good striker. Dude. It what a crazy time this sport has gone through and all these years. Like this fight was so horrible to watch, man, these guys were so busted up. Look

0 (2h 57m 6s):
At,

2 (2h 57m 7s):
Look at Rory's nose. It's gone. It's,

0 (2h 57m 11s):
It's, that's how it ends.

5 (2h 57m 12s):
Fucking

0 (2h 57m 12s):
Punches him Right Again.

2 (2h 57m 14s):
Oh. And then it just like, he can't take it anymore. Head

5 (2h 57m 16s):
Split open his lips split

2 (2h 57m 17s):
Open. Yeah. His lips hanging off.

4 (2h 57m 19s):
Yeah. That's, this is easy to eat. Easily. The best fight of all

0 (2h 57m 22s):
Time. He's played by Robbie. I

2 (2h 57m 23s):
Certainly in the conversation.

0 (2h 57m 25s):
Yeah. Robbie, he left Nice. He knocked out. I forgot who he finished.

4 (2h 57m 29s):
Nico Price. Nico

2 (2h 57m 30s):
Price. Nico Price.

0 (2h 57m 31s):
Nico. First round. And then he went off to the sunset

2 (2h 57m 33s):
And he knocked him out without taking a shot. I,

4 (2h 57m 35s):
That was great. And that's so

0 (2h 57m 36s):
Easy to say. I want one more after that,

5 (2h 57m 39s):
The ride off.

2 (2h 57m 40s):
But he's gonna be a great coach too. And I'm sure he is, but he's also a guy. Like you want that guy to be proud of you. Yeah.

4 (2h 57m 46s):
Yeah.

2 (2h 57m 46s):
It's Robbie Lawler. Yeah, for sure. Like, there's something to that. if you getting coached by a guy like that, look at his face man.

0 (2h 57m 51s):
Look at that. Stay in school kids. Yeah. There

2 (2h 57m 54s):
You go. Yeah. You better really know what you want if you're gonna do this for a living.

0 (2h 57m 57s):
Yeah, dude.

4 (2h 57m 59s):
And you gotta look across and see that shit.

0 (2h 58m 0s):
Right? Yeah. This guy's got a fucking joker smile

2 (2h 58m 3s):
On him hanging out. He's Ready to go to war for the fucking final round.

5 (2h 58m 6s):
Ooh, what a sick fight.

0 (2h 58m 8s):
Ah, shit.

2 (2h 58m 9s):
We've seen some wild fights, boys.

0 (2h 58m 10s):
Yeah. We're gonna see some wild ones this weekend. Yeah.

2 (2h 58m 12s):
I'm excited. I don't know what's gonna happen in the main event. I know you're partial to Miab, but I, I just don't know what's gonna happen. I'm very interested, very interested.

0 (2h 58m 21s):
Gets past that first round. He's

5 (2h 58m 23s):
Gotta keep them hands up.

0 (2h 58m 23s):
It's one clinch. Yeah.

2 (2h 58m 25s):
It's gonna be very

0 (2h 58m 26s):
Interest. He's saying he needs one shot. I'm saying Moab needs one clinch not to end the fight if you do enough damage. The thing

2 (2h 58m 30s):
Is, I feel like sugar is a better striker than Marlon. And Marlon had Moab in trouble. And that's what gives me pause on the feet. Like you can only take so many of those sniper shots from sugar, the other thing. But can he land them and can Rob keep, keep moving and keep threatening and pressure You know the argument is there's one guy who's gonna win by taking him down and smashing them and the other guy's gonna win by knocking him out on the feet. And we don't You know. we don't know what's gonna play out. Right. It's gonna be interesting. It's

0 (2h 58m 58s):
Gonna be fucking phenomenal. The phenomenal

5 (2h 59m 0s):
The thing that I think Yeah. That Sean does well, like he got Al Joe with it is, I mean, you know, RA's gonna be pressuring 'cause that's how he's, he's going to, he has to beat him. Sean took out Al Joe backing up. Yep. You know what I mean? Yep. So he, a lot of guys can't fight moving backwards. He does have the ability to fight moving backwards. So

2 (2h 59m 20s):
He's also a great game planner.

5 (2h 59m 22s):
You gotta put him on

2 (2h 59m 23s):
That fence. Him and Tim Welch have a great relationship. They, they study shit. They find holes. You know. They knew that Al Joe has this tendency to get like a little over anxious and charge him definitely with lunge

5 (2h 59m 32s):
When the

2 (2h 59m 33s):
Strikes. He was ready for that. I'm just interested to see if he can capitalize. 'cause if he can't, if Ro can get ahold of him, RA's just a different kind of wolverine on top of you.

5 (2h 59m 41s):
I think he needs one round. Mushing him in the fence. Just like wear him out. Like kinda like Gs P did with bj. BJ You know, wear him out A little bit. Slow him down A little bit. And then you can put the pace on him.

2 (2h 59m 52s):
It's gonna be very exciting.

0 (2h 59m 53s):
Some guys are afraid of extending too much energy on a take down and it's not And he's not going to. And that same energy you felt in the first

5 (3h 0m 2s):
It's

0 (3h 0m 2s):
Coming, you're gonna feel in the fifth. Yeah. Yeah.

5 (3h 0m 4s):
A thousand percent.

0 (3h 0m 5s):
That's, that's what we're dealing with. Look,

5 (3h 0m 6s):
Tank. I'm rooting, rooting for Marab. I like, I like him. I think he's great by the way.

2 (3h 0m 10s):
I, a gas tank is such a

0 (3h 0m 11s):
Weapon. It's another weapon. Weapon in the arsenals

2 (3h 0m 14s):
Weapon really is,

5 (3h 0m 15s):
It might be the most important. 'cause what's the difference? What You know if you can't get out there and apply it.

2 (3h 0m 19s):
And Ham's one of them nutty dudes at spars up until the day of the fight. Right.

0 (3h 0m 23s):
He's, dude, I've seen that guy clocking rounds. That was just ridiculous. I'm like, wait, he already did five rounds. Why is he going back? It's insane what he does. It's not normal. And, and, and again, I think that he, if he doesn't get caught with that perfect shot, he's a hard guy to put away and he's not gonna stop. He's a little Terminator. And he also

2 (3h 0m 44s):
Knows this is his big moment. Yeah. That's

0 (3h 0m 47s):
Also the pressure is not gonna be, he's not. I've already, when he was gonna fight the PD on PD on when he had that PD on fight before that fight got on the table, like when they were talking about it, he told me and I was like, I don't, I he didn't until he accepted it. Like, he was like, there's so much pressure in this fight. I, I, he goes, I You know the history between Georgia and Russia. He goes, this is not just a fight for me. I if I lose this. He was so, the pressure was so much. Wow. I just wouldn't tell

5 (3h 1m 17s):
You his country. That's

0 (3h 1m 18s):
Different. That's one of my proudest, like, when he took that fight and the way he handled it, he was different in that fight. Even the lead up, he's calling him a bitch. He's, he's dealing with the Russian bully. And so when he won that, he, that was like, that was like the title fight to me. Im like, Oh.

5 (3h 1m 32s):
Yeah. He whoop his ass too. He, it was a dominant performance.

0 (3h 1m 34s):
Oh my goodness.

2 (3h 1m 35s):
That was a wake up call for everybody in the division. Like he can do that to Yawn. Oh my God. Jan's a strong motherfucker, man. He's a strong dude. And,

5 (3h 1m 42s):
And Rob was able to stand with guys like Jan and things. So he's definitely not, he's not definitely not incapable there. That's

2 (3h 1m 49s):
No, he can fuck you up on the feet too. And that's part of the problem with the guy who's trying to take you down all the time. Yeah. He's always ready for that. Yeah. And then these bombs are coming your way. They

5 (3h 1m 56s):
Get off of

2 (3h 1m 57s):
You. But Sean is such a fucking sniper. Yeah. And he's so agile. His styles, his

4 (3h 2m 2s):
Athleticism, his movement is, is

0 (3h 2m 4s):
Is crazy

2 (3h 2m 4s):
Switching stances, fighting just as good off the left as off the right. He can switch stances in the middle of a combination. Choose Angles is just Kenny. He keep that fucking animal off of 'em

0 (3h 2m 14s):
And they're both extremely confident. Yeah,

4 (3h 2m 17s):
That's that's

0 (3h 2m 18s):
What I'm saying. I like when it's, yeah, I love that shit, you know?

2 (3h 2m 21s):
Yeah. It's exciting. It's

5 (3h 2m 23s):
Exciting. It's a real clash of style. So,

2 (3h 2m 25s):
So many fucking good fights these days, man. We're a good time to be a fan. Right? You

4 (3h 2m 29s):
Know. Fuck yeah man.

5 (3h 2m 30s):
We're spoiled.

2 (3h 2m 31s):
We're so spoiled the most I

4 (3h 2m 34s):
Know.

5 (3h 2m 34s):
I mean, and boxing's making a little comeback too. Oh. yeah. Oh. yeah. I think You know Once Ante and Ryan Garcia got it on now it seems like they're starting to make some more fights.

2 (3h 2m 42s):
Well the Saudis Saudis

4 (3h 2m 45s):
Money.

0 (3h 2m 46s):
That's

5 (3h 2m 46s):
Good. They're bringing the money. What do you think of them? They're talking, I mean are they really doing Canelo for 20 bucks or something? You saw what they were saying

2 (3h 2m 53s):
On the pay-per-view. It's only

5 (3h 2m 54s):
$20. I don't, don't quote me, but the, I don't think so. The Prince who runs that Riyadh stuff said he's gonna make all pay-per-view $20. 'cause he believe believes that you'd have more people. It would make it more ex expose it to more people, grow the audience. We'd still make money and everybody will be

2 (3h 3m 11s):
Able to watch it. I wonder if, how many more people would buy it if it's 20 rather than 70. They might make their money. That's,

5 (3h 3m 16s):
I mean that's what he's saying. And he

4 (3h 3m 17s):
Was talking about the, if

5 (3h 3m 18s):
He said he do pinello for free.

4 (3h 3m 20s):
Yeah. He said, he said if it was that cheap that people would stop pirating that too.

2 (3h 3m 24s):
They might, yeah. 70 bucks is a lot. It's like, isn't it 79? Sometimes

4 (3h 3m 30s):
It's more than like 80 bucks. Like

5 (3h 3m 32s):
Yeah, I mean I You know it's a lot.

2 (3h 3m 34s):
It was 20 bucks. I wonder, I wonder how much, I mean, it'd be an interesting thing to try. Yeah.

4 (3h 3m 39s):
I didn't know they were gonna start with Canelo, although they were starting with Better Beef. But

2 (3h 3m 43s):
I

5 (3h 3m 43s):
Mean that'd be, and nobody even

4 (3h 3m 46s):
Knows they were talking about doing that for like 15 bucks. Nobody

5 (3h 3m 49s):
Even knows about them. They should know these two. I know. I mean, they're both sick. Sick boxers

2 (3h 3m 54s):
Isn't better. Beef 20. Oh with 20 knockouts. Yeah. Yeah. I ain't, but he's

0 (3h 3m 58s):
39. I don't even watch the fucking boxing to be honest. I, I can't watch it after the MMA. I just watched the fights.
