I'm Leno kind of rules for this.


Yeah, He does. I love It. Look, the guy's out there. I don't want to Take him on a daily show. He's got a hell of a chin. I don't have the balls to ride a motorcycle. Hell of a chin. Dude. Dude. Yeah, you got that right. Damn. Tough guy. Clean comics. They're psychos. He was Really good back in the day. Oh, it was really, really good in the seventies. I, when I started, people were saying obviously with everyone was like prior number one and then like who's number two was the only, and then they go, A lot of people said Leno. Leno was an edgy motherfucker when he was young. What? But he wanted that job, man. Mm. We gotta realize what that carrot was to guys from that era. If you have a chance to host a Tonight show, that is the end all be all. Fuck selling out Madison Square Garden doing standup. Yeah. Fucking HBO special.


The Tonight Show was the spot. You were the king Maker. You're, you take over Carson that you were on the level of Frank Sinatra. Yes. You guys would be friends now. Yeah. And there were like four jobs back then for comics. Exactly. You can make other comics, but it wasn The job. If you were a guy coming up in the seventies and then in the eighties, that job was the fucking ultimate top Position. Yeah. Well this is the Tonight Show now wouldn't you say That's Oh, ridiculous. But I think it's, I mean it's not clean and you don't have to wear a suit, but it's watching it tonight Show. Luckily I didn't want this. Right. This is not This. Oh this is a tonight show now. Oh, I get it. I get it. This show, The difference is like I, I'm not changing who I am to get this because I needed this also notice.


But I think that's what Jay Leno did. Of course. I think he was an edgy like Oh really? He was a like leather jacket fucking talking shit about people. Really? Yeah, man. Oh yeah, he was good. Dude. You ever see on Letterman when eating a hogie? He's just sitting there eating a hogie fucking with Letterman. He was good. What Up? Also, when he took over, he had a day where he is like, you can host today a hogie. He booked Michael Richards. He goes, I want you on. He was booking like weird, edgy people for his version of that show. N Word. He's, he was a real comic, but, oh yeah. I think that job just like demands compliance. You have to fi fit into that position. And then, You know, remember that Bill Hicks bit about Oh yeah. Him interviewing Joey Lawrence. So Joey, you got a girlfriend? Yeah. Well no, she thinks so.


And then, and then Jay Leno reaches in and grabs an oozy and sprays his brains out. He goes, I used to be a good cop. He unloads the clip and reloads it and his brains spray out into a NBC peacock because he's a company man to the bitter end. Oh man. Whoa. Whoa. Dude. It's funny. Hicks, I asked Jay Leno about that bit once what he, he had a weird response and he was like, yeah, well, You know, he didn't wanna do jokes for everybody. I forgot. He talks like he's from the twenties too. Yeah. He's getting Three Stooges injuries and be like, oh Norman, you and Leno should have a convo. He was a fun guy on the podcast. 'cause he was telling these crazy stories about old school shows that he did like this mafia guy yelling at a priest and, and Jay Leno was screaming and swearing.


It was wild. Wow. You know, his old move before there were a bunch of clubs around in the late sixties, he would go to a strip club, put, put 50 bucks on the bar and go, if I bomb keep it. And if I do, well just gimme the 50 back. Really true story. You this le He would not even be working For free Leno Rules. Yeah, Leno's great. He Just became a different guy to get that show. That's really what it is. Yeah. It happens a lot in la. Wow. That's the sitcom thing, man. You see it a lot with guys that are really good comics coming up and then they get on a show and they start being careful. Yeah. You start pulling back. You have a Netflix show. It's different. Yeah, I'm, I'm right. That's a different animal. Yeah. But also opposite.


He went in D Style where he is like, I'm gonna be me. And then like, we're signing you for you smart. So he can keep being him. Yeah. Yeah. You can. It's possible to keep being you, but it's, it's very difficult. Yeah. Most people, they get trapped by the fucking siren song and the, You know, the Banshees lead them into the rocks Basically. Standup is always the most incentive. That's the most incentive. Yeah. Yeah. That you could possibly have. It should be. But it is for pe. But people that are that really captivated by the idea of having a show for them, it's like the ultimate I made it. Yeah. I have my own show. Standup is so much easier. So Much better. It's the bonus. Easier. So much better. The best. I remember when I found out how much money people would make doing standup. Like if they sold out a whole weekend at the Herba and Improv.


Oh. I was like, that's what I get at a comedy club. What they get at Comedy club is when I get on sitcoms. A season. Yeah, no, no. An epi Be close. No, not The Irvine. It's a different, what you're doing is they're No, no, No, no. For sure. A long time ago, no one was doing the Wells Fargo For Arena could free tickets to the Wells Fargo. Bro. Relax.

For a whole year. Yeah. What a teacher gets in a whole year. You get in a weekend being drunk. Yes. There's Big drunk. It might be a problem. Might Dick, that's kind of a problem. It's not though. 'cause it's hard to get there. It's you, they could do it too. You don't like teaching put put together an act.


Just, It just takes It's true. 15 years and build up. Build up. That's the thing like That, the reality of comedy is it really takes 10 years to be any good. Yeah. It's, it's like a 10 year process. It's funny to see the friends from like high school go from like, oh that's cool. But also like, I feel sorry for him. We're all trying to get big in business and always like barely able to pour McDonald's and then like as you start, oh he is doing okay. And then like either like hell yeah. Or jealousy. Like why you get this? Oh yeah. There's a lot of that. It's before for two Decades. Well, You know where the real jealousy comes from. People that don't have any growth in their profession where they, it's not possible. Like this is the, the height of you can maintain this and you, you budget your lifestyle and you'll be fine. But there's no dream. There's no chase.


There's no thing. So when they see a guy like you chasing stuff, putting together specials, getting more popular. Oh my God. He sold out. What? Oh that's crazy.

It might be a war, It might be the end of the world If it's, it could be the end of the world. Could be a hot war where they could suspend this changing of the guard too. Who knows what the fuck had happened. Aren't they just trying to occupy Russia? Just keep them occupied. Here's the thing. Is that the deal? I don't know If you've Got Shit, if you've got a guy that's coming in that wants to find all the corruption and find what happened during 2020 and find out who colluded and check emails and check, there's a lot of incentive to do some wild shit to keep him from taking that position.


I know that's super tinfoil Hattie. I mean, it's not Hunter. Why else? Why was Hunter at Burma? Right? Good question. Question. Why is, What does that mean? What are those terms? They Hired Hunter Biden's son was working for Barisma, which is a, a huge company in Ukraine. He was making millions of dollars for a job he was completely Unqualified for. So Energy V. He was on the board in Energy company in Ukraine while he was, I think it was like while he was on crack Around there. Well how about that crazy speech where Biden is on stage with a couple of guys and he is talking about how he fired the prosecutor. He got the prosecutor fired. Yeah. Or they wouldn't have got the money. The, let's see if you can find that. 'cause this is, it's so crazy.


This guy's ego is so nuts that he said this publicly just to flex. He's basically just explaining the power that he had. Yeah. As vice president while his son was working for Barisma and he's just expressing it publicly. Damn. And it should be a crime. It's like what you're saying sounds Like It doesn't sound like what I want from the president. It sounds crazy. Damn. But For, for a crackhead. He got a lot done. He was going wild.

Joe's Hunter's funny now Joe's at the end and he's kind of Well, Joe. Joe, The whole Joe. First of all, if you think it's Joe's idea to launch those missiles, there's no fucking way Joe.


Joe has nothing to do with that. Joe had a giant smile on his face when he was sitting there with Trump. Giant smile. Yeah. Did you see Gaffigan's joke about, about that is Apparently, Yeah. Gaffigan's joke about, he goes, there's only a couple Democrats that don't, that don't like Kamala and it's Joe Biden's family. Ah. So like play this so we could hear it start from the beginning. Oh, billion Dollars. No, I said I'm not going, we're not gonna give you the billion dollars. They said, you have no authority. You're not the president. The president said, I said call him. I said, I'm telling you you're not getting a billion dollars.


I said, you're not getting a billion. I'm gonna be leaving here. And I think it was what, six hours. I looked at it, I said, I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor's not fired, you're not getting the money. Well son of a bitch got fired and they put in place someone who was solid at the time. Man. So much. Sharp. This is in Ference.

So whistleblower complaint centering on President Donald Trump's phone call with Ukrainian president has spurred a number of allegations, counter allegations as Republican's, Democrats jockey for position amid an impeachment inquiry at the heart of Congress. Probe into the president's actions. It is his claim that former vice president in 2020, democratic front rudder Joe Biden, strong arm, the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor in order to thwart an investigation into a company tied to his son Hunter Biden. But sources ranging from former Obama administration officials to anti-corruption advocate in Ukraine, say the official Victor Shoken was ousted for the opposite reason Trump and his allies claim. Of course they say that it was, wasn't because Shoken was investigating a natural gas company tied to Biden's son.


It was because Shan wasn't pursuing corruption amongst the country's politicians. According to a Ukrainian official and four former American officials who specialize in Ukrainian Europe. That sounds like a convenient narrative. I don't know what's true, but that sounds a little convenient. Yep. Oh no, no, no. He, he was fired because he wasn't investigating corruption. We, we insist that they investigate corruption in other countries and if they don't, we won't give you the money. In fact, we are so ethical that if we don't look at your papers so ethical and find zero corruption, you don't get the billion dollars. Well, son of a bitch. Yeah, they fired him. Well, shut the fuck up. What am I a child?

Literally every major city is failing under opioids and homelessness and you're going, It's just bad advice. Shootings, bad advice. It's just bad advice from the beginning. Like the very beginning is bad advice. Hey, I mean listen, it's like the the New York Giants. You're putting some fucking local kid, a quarterback. 'cause he's gonna do the best he can. Some lady came in with two months to go like, I don't know, try your best. Oh Yeah. Is it true that try your best. She got put in because Biden endorsed her as he was leaving and that that wasn't initially the plan. I've seen that I've, I've read that several times. I thought he Like refused to endorse her for a while.


Right. Actually I think Because she pushed Him out. Because she pushed him out. But then once he did, he found out that allegedly, this is what I had read. Yeah. That they wanted to do a primary, but Biden said publicly, I'll just endorse Kamala. And he didn't think that Kamala could win. Wow. This is the allegation. So he was like, fuck you. That's look at his smile on his face. I think it's DEI. I think nobody can tell a black woman. She can't be the one. The smiles. But The smiles insane. But a primary can Tell you smile. I heard about it. I haven't seen it. If She crumbles in the primary, the way she crumbled in the primary for president. Yeah. Then if Gavin Newsom or Josh Shapiro, whoever it is that gets the words over on her, that person emerges naturally. Right. It's just like she fucked up. She's just not good. It has nothing to do with anything else. No. I talked to a lot of liberals and they were like, this isn't our, this isn't our guy.

Them coming after us has just raised us up hella. It also makes you realize you have to say something. Have to say something. That's so insane. You did that on purpose. Dude. You're a Cocksucker.

I was just undeveloped because The Diaz story. Oh yeah. Diaz just wouldn't, He wouldn't show up. He wouldn't So show up. You Had to hire up as a backup. So instead of just firing your opener, who just wouldn't cut. Joe would be at the airport, be like, Joey, where are you? He goes off, I'm almost there in bed.


Not even getting outta bed. And then eventually Joe was like, I fucking, I don't have an opener again. Instead of just firing Joey, he goes, I guess I'll take two people now. Wow. So it's either one or two, depending on how Joey showed up. It was too much fun when Joey showed. It Really Was. And I knew I had a good friend who was a junkie in New York. My friend Johnny and he died. Johnny, The pool player. Yeah. I Met him. He was my best friend and he, he died after I was, I was only out here for a couple years and he died And it it really la?

I knew the type I knew like, and I miss Johnny so much after he was gone.


So it was like, whatever I have to do to keep this guy around. This is Joey. Joey still used, he's not using anymore. He is way healthier. But back then he was like, he was, the end was sight. He Was using in a crazy way. He was, what was he using? Coke. Okay. Coke. Or by the way, a bunch of other stuff. One time he was like, yeah, I did crack for six months. I'm like, why? He goes, 'cause the Coke dealer was like out of the way home and the crack dealer was on the way home. It was just easier. He was, Joey was off the rails. But rail, If he loved you, he was your best friend. He was like one of the best friends you could ever have if he loved you. Yeah. And so I was like, I gotta do whatever I gotta do. So I didn't wanna push him. So I would always tell him, You know, if you ever need help, I'll help you.


He knows I don't need no fucking help. But when we would go on the road, if he would just not show up, I would say, listen, anytime you want to go on the road with me, you're gonna get paid. Yeah. You're gonna, you can work with me anytime you want, but I'm gonna bring another opening act if you don't show, show up And it, that's my whole career. Joey's Defense.

Shopped her face on an existing photograph of a girl from the 1980s that did work at McDonald's And it was a white girl. So they photoshopped Kamala's face. Just some internet jackass did it, I'm sure. And said, oh, we have proof. But they were trying to pass it off as it was real. But why is working at McDonald's good? Because it's victim. It's like the lowest level. It's the lowest level job. But Why is that? Who cares? You're working Class in these days when you don't all brag about your Yeah. Your hardships To say you came from McDonald's to the president's. Pretty sick. Also, also, when you're a person who's like trying to con their way into a job where you're gonna make an insane amount of money, it's really cool to say start it from the bottom now way.

You Son of a bitch. We gotta, that's the last, we gotta remove that from the internet. No, I love Puerto Rico. San Juan Baby. I'm kidding. That's the Tony joke.


A wild thing. The Fucked up thing is that joke was based on his need to like, he, he gets freaked out about the environment. He gets freaked out about the, the pollution patch While he's in a throne. We were super high. We were super high in going on the green room, Like right in the world. He's like, how long have there been plastic? There's only been plastic for six years. It's bigger than fucking Texas. It's in the, and so he sits getting obsessed by garbage. Then he finds out about Puerto Rico. And so then he comes up with this joke. There's an island of garbage. I think it's called Puerto Rico. Yeah. And it iss like, but the joke was actually out of his concern that Puerto Rico, he's an environmentalist, smothered by guard. He actually loves Puerto Rico. He's Trying to Protect Our Parks to protect Puerto, he's a Retard. He's just a retard. He's A male girl. He doesn't understand. People don't know the whole backstory to That joke.


It's so funny. They know joke About Puerto Rico doing in a fucking Trump rally. You should have defended him. You should have come out and just been like, he's retarded. That would be the right Way. Say I kind of did. I mean, I, I basically said that like this is, this is where it came from. Like the Tony's just, yeah. He's a fucking insult comic. He's the best insult comic in the country. If you wanna watch that, that roast, watch that Tom Brady, Brady Roast. Oh, So funny. Watching John Stewart. He's a like, that's Terrible. I talked to props to Stewart. Prop to, to Stewart for sure. Props. Stewart. Stewart. He's a real comic. It Stuart's Like, he's a funny guy. Yeah. It Was wild last that they saw that joke and everyone was angry within one minute. And it's like n no nothing to like, let me anana analyze the arts.


Let just figure out what this is. But instantly, like I know what it's, I'm done with it. It's just demeaning to Like It. Everything that's, it's Exactly what we were talking about earlier. That does happen to people where they can become someone else. But Stewart has not done that. He still Done that. Still goes on stage, done that. He's with Chappelle. He still goes on stage with Chappelle. He's still, he does podcasts. He's very reasonable when he does them. I think he also got disillusioned by that fucking Apple gig where they canceled his show because he wouldn't do, he was wanna do a thing on China. And they're like, no fucking way. Really? And like it wasn it. Oh wow. China, You can't talk shit about, about China. You can't even tell the truth. You can't say if you're on an Apple show and Apple has this insane manufacturing deal with China.


Oh, all their Phones, slave labor, everything. Think about that. Slave labors. It's The craziest thing that these What about The Weaver? These Two signaling people Like Schultz. Yeah. Yeah. Anytime. Anytime the liberals get at, you just go using an iPhone. Fuck off. Yeah. Shut off. Shut your mouth. Go get a Samsung if you really care. Yeah. Didn't John cna, he had to do a whole thing. Remember that? Yeah. Oh yeah. He nailed it. Wasn fast. Furious. He nailed, nailed. He nailed it. He nailed it. Got the language down. That's, I was Shit in the streets before he did it. I had a bit about that for a while. I was like, that's when I knew that China was gonna win. 'cause they already got our Mascot. They got our guy. He's the most American looking guy ever. That's True. Seen the fucking rules dude. Square His wrists are so big.


He looks like his forearm is cut off here. He looks fake. He looks fake. It's crazy. It looks like his arm should be way longer. But they moved his hand up his forearm like he's got No, It does look like that. They're Hams, bro. Damn. That's the downton of communities, bro. He is The number one downstream. Yes. John seen it bro. Hitting a fucking salute. Running in in jean shorts. Fucking people up shooting shorts. Shit. Rocks. He's Mr. Make-A-Wish. He's That's I'll bet, man. I Bet. Zena. Yeah. Come on. I didn't like with Tony, with all the comics weighing in, that really was the bug the Most. You're always gonna have that from weak people that aren't happy with where they are. That's what it is. Oh. So people are waiting to jump on Tony. Hundred Percent. That's it. That's it. Like now that he can't fight back, I'll jump in there.


Right. Exactly. They never shit on some low level guy. He's doing great. And you can not like him If he's doing great, let shit on low level guy. Yeah. I go on an open mic and be like this racist piece of shit. You're allowed to not like him If he's doing great. Yeah. But if you're attacking him, like you don't know what he was doing. You don't know what he was doing. He was just doing what he always does. He's an insult. Come. Are you saying you don't like insult comedy? So you don't like roast? So say that two months ago. Why are you saying it right now? Listen, man, roasts are one of the things that's gonna save comedy because they're so funny that it's undeniable to Netflix. So Netflix gets the highest ratings they've ever had ever on this Tom Brady roast. They Can't weigh it. It's Completely non pc. It's some of the wildest jokes. Tony calls a confederate fag.


Like it's some of the wild and it's killing and it's so funny and people love it and they keep sharing it. Right. And people keep sending it to their friends and clips are made out of it. It's huge for Netflix. Without that, you don't get the freedom to do whatever the fuck you want on stage. I Make fun of Tony a lot, but it wasn, it wasn like a nice moment. Gangster. I was sitting there gangster when he did the roast. He killed it. And I gave him a joke right before. And this is how like in the pocket he was. 'cause he like stood up from the table and I was like, hello. Started. I felt, I was like genuinely happy. I was like watching him fucking kill. Yeah. And then the joke I gave him, he did. I I gave it to him right before. What was the joke he went on? I don't wanna say All right. Puerto Rico. It was a insult personally at one of the comedians.


Oh. I was like, tell them motherfucker. Oh shit. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. So I pretty much know already then. Yeah, I know too. Nick gla the horse. Shut it down. Fuck up. Mark everything. I trash Nick. I Love Nick. I like Nick too. But no, I actually do. I do. I do too. But I love Nick. Right before he tells the joke, he looks, he literally looked over at me and was like, did a little gate. I was like, yes. Nice. And he c the from the audience like that. That ain't easy to walk up Like that. Well, You know, we wanted him to do a set seated. And he was like, this is stupid. See, I need, Because irrespective how any store guy, like no, you're not one of the cool kids. So it's like, dude, fuck off.


Just let the guy shine. Well loose, let out resistance to him with the power Hungry. W Lot of resistance to that hinch cliff fell So much butted here. Fuck. Well just say you're mad. He's at a Trump rally. That all right. That I get. Okay. Why are you gonna use the joke as a vehicle to get angry? Is that's Both, that's both things. The joke is nothing but the fact that if the joke just released on YouTube, eh, people would get mad. Maybe the Kamala Harris camp would use it to show that this guy's a Trump supporter. But it does, it's not connected to Trump. The fact that it's after the Trump rally, which is so crazy. He did It there. They should was never, but they're Also waiting. It's like Alexandra Corco sitting there like fucking Who?


Alexander Corco. Yeah. She have been doing that Duolingo shit. She's sitting there waiting like, what can I be angry about? Good. And she's like, that's why's, that's not the target market. It's, They're trying to win, man. Well it's, you're looking at it like they should be reasonable. Why would they be reasonable when they're trying to win? They're, they wanna exploit every last possible thing. And Tony gave 'em a bunch of rope. Yeah. Yeah. And they hung him. Well they they were already calling it a fucking Nazi rally. Right? Right. Yes. And then you have a comedian go up there that probably a lot of them had no idea who he was. Sure. Right. Like the people talking about it. And then he's, I mean the fucking watermelon carving joke, it wasn the one that should have been Fucking it wasn. So stupid interest. It wasn an improv. I know. You could tell it wasn dumb Ass. He like, you fucking did.


Oh, It wasn dumb as I thought it was funny. I gave him that one. I thought it was funny. I don't know. We get at a comedy club, at a comedy Alley, at a fucking roast. I liked It is a comedy club. He great at a roast battle. Yeah. Once they made it a Nazi rally, then it's like, well then nothing's gonna work here to you guys. Right. It's a full German Nazi rally Fucking Israeli flags at a Nazi rally. I saw four Israeli flags hanging from the rafters. Yeah. There was Israeli flags that people brought. The whole idea. It wasn Nazi rally, Maybe crazy pro genocide. They, no one believes it, man. That's why they're not talking about it now. Might have to flag that one, pull that one out. But yes, this's guy named it up. Now I like, I like when the comics do, like, when they'll try to defend somebody, but they're so scared of the backlash.


They go, look, I didn't like that joke. But it's his right to say it. It's like, bro, how about took comments on the, you don't like jokes. How about when Patton took a picture with Chappelle and he had a take a photo of him writing an apology on a piece of paper. It wasn weak. He, I think he felt really bad about that. He did. It wasn the height of all shit. He felt Pressured. He felt bad about that. Wait a week, let the press scared pressure go away then if you have to weigh in. Well the Internet coming at you is scary people Panick David. Yeah. Don't read it. Tony handled it really Well's so hard not to read. Take a joke. Don't fuck off. And then just not another word about it. I, I had to read the thing about the view. 'cause I just thought it was funny. What's reason, why read that about me Dragon lover. Tell Me what this says. I was trying to say that I believe in dragons. Wait, what Is this?


I heard about About, I said I checked it. I checked it and they, the lady goes, she double check it. She goes, I checked it. He bleeds in. Dragon should be like sa. They lived alongside of people. Wait, It was from a wildlife biologist who came on with my podcast. It was from Forrest Gallant Ante Gallant. How do I say his last name? Great guy. I love him. He's awesome. Lock and Jamie, he's saying are, yeah, right there are fucking off Jaymo. Let's do it. Jamie, you have a coffee. Anything up you can find Forest's. Clip where he is explaining Dragon now that Jamie looks like a Mexican, he's lazy. This Is, this is where it came from. They're hard. The view decided from this and from me talking about it with Adrian Ucci the other day explaining what Forests says and saying that I don't think that there was terra axles living with people. I said it. No. She said maybe they did live with this.


I'm like It, I thought I, my position is it's probably crocodiles or some big komodo dragon or some big lizard that did kill people. Takes one. And so people fought them with swords and shit and they came back with a story and then the artist drew it and these things. Yeah, you saw One of those at night and you had a stick. Yeah. It'd be like throw tear deck all throughout I a picture of Joe ro it in a unicorn. All Throughout these same time periods, there's been giant lizards all throughout the same time, time periods. There have been Komodo dragons, there've been crocodiles have been here for fucking hundreds of million years or whatever they've been for. There's probably more. So the idea that that people didn't encounter giant reptiles is stupid. And then there's the other thing is like, people were really bad at describing things that they'd never seen before.


So if you're a European traveler and you go to the Nile River and you see a fucking crocodile, say Cro, what is that? Take a guy. Yeah. What is that? You know, what the fuck, what is that? Or baby in Florida, what is that? So let's can hold any weight like that. There was actually dragons. I I I mean we know there were large flying lizards during the times of dinosaurs. Right, right. The only weight that it could possibly hold is that like a few of those somehow survived much later than we previously thought. Jesus. But I do, I think that there were dragons attacking human beings and civilizations. No, I don't. J Vance Looks terrible. So interest, it's so much cooler. If there were Right. And like the fact we know that Pterodactyls did exist. That's cool. Right. Would be way cooler as if they existed with people. Right. 2000 years ago.


Why is That? But why is that so much cooler to us? I dunno. It's like I would be, I would, I mean, people would dedicate giant chunks of their life trying to find out if Tactal did coexist with human beings one time. Oh no. I swear. I thought, I thought you had tactal on your Shirt there. And I was like, yeah, this is the most autistic. Oh, that be hilarious. I ever, So I think that's why can't Als be real Cafaro shirt. The problem is you're taking Joey, Joey Behar, whatever her name is as like a, as like a new This is right as a news source. Do you have No, no, no, no, no, No, no, no, no. This is the most important Part. You know, Hey, this is the most important part. This is right after she was saying, we are run by a, b, c news. You should trust us.


Not Joe Rogan who believes in dragons. So she, she What by saying we should trust them because they're DoubleCheck by a, b, c news and then making the stupidest fucking statement. Like, you're, you're, you didn't listen to what I said. Yeah. You didn't listen to what the wildlife followed. And that's only a part of what he said. I can't believe that part of what he said. And it was something before that where he was explaining encounters with giant reptiles. I dunno. And then there's also, listen, It doesn't make sense to me that a middle aged woman could be dumb When you're worried about losing your job. Yeah. And you're worried about podcasts taking over and who's the source of news? And we said Donald Trump has Hitler, but half the country disagreed with us. And he won.


And this is fucking great. And Joe Rogan believes in dragons. But it's, it's just frantic Bro. If you believe that Donald Trump is Hitler and everyone who supports him is a massive racist. And if you are in any ethnic or gay, you need to get the fuck out this country. 'cause if you believe all that, it's bad for you here. But Sonny Hostin, she makes some good points. Who's that? She's the other one that's Not gonna clip. Well, I'm just saying like, like if they really believe us, what are you still doing here, Jamie? There's a photo that I have on my Instagram. You gotta start drinking. Ari. Go. I'm drinking Jamie. There's a photo I have on my Instagram of a whale that's on a wall in an old Italian church. It was from like 2017 or 2018.


I was in Revelo. And there's this church that's, it's so old. The church is a thousand years old, but it's built on top of another church. And they don't even know how old that church is. Yeah. There's like a glass floor and you look down, you can see the old church. They don't, they have no idea how old it is. But they had a painting of like the whale from the, from the Bible. Who is it? Job? Who is it? Yeah. Jonah. Jonah. Jonah. Jonah. That's right. Jonah. So look at this photo. This is this ancient, ancient church. But there's a photo of a whale that's in, is it in that? Where's Revelo? It's around the same time. I know. I put the photo on Instagram. Oh, Italy. That's the church. But in that church there's the whale Doesn't look nothing like a whale. The whale looks like a monster. Gerald.


Loose and dragons. So that's What it's like. There we go. Here we go. Their drawings was like, they came back and described those fucking mercenaries couldn't draw. They're bad. The guys who came by the savages, the fucking animals that were hacking off heads in the Congo. They don't, they're not drawing. I've been real busy. Pillaging can work on my art. And then the artist draws it and they could probably barely remember. 'cause it's probably so traumatic. Yeah. A 16 foot crocodile comes launching out of the river and takes one of your boys and eats 'em in front of everybody's like, what? That's it. Yeah. That's good. That what? What they thought a whale looked like a whale. Oh that's, that's a, that's a crocodile. That's a So it, it's, that is the story from the Bible. That's Badass. They had never seen a whale before.


So they drew this thing, he blown up wheat. Look how bad they got the guy. Right? I mean, they knew what guys looked like and they were struggling. Yeah. They weren't good artists. They looks Like a alien monkey. They're doing it in tile in all defense. He, it's a very difficult medium to work with. What's A higher prime rate there? What is this? I know at that guy. Isn't that wild though? So that is what he's, I'm bugging outta here. Be cool bros. So their version of things that we know that what looked like were all fucked up already. Yeah. So that's probably what dragons are. What dragons are probably giant crocodiles. There you go. And there's some people that went to the Congo in the 18 hundreds that said they saw crocodiles bigger than their boats. 40 foot boats and crocodiles were bigger than their boats. Yeah. That's stupid. The thing about crocodiles is they don't A, they don't die.


Right. They just stay alive until something kills them. So they keep growing. So if you got a crocodile, it could be 300, 400 years old and that would be like a 60 foot crocodile. And that really, they might have seen those back. They get that old And that's when people had guns. Right. So the people with the guns are probably killing all the ones that are really big. You can see. So those ones that are really big, they've been eating other crocodiles, they've eaten everything, cannibalize each other. They eat everything that moves. So to get to that point is so hard that when you whack those dudes, the ones that are left are like 30 years old. 50 years old. Yeah. Like you'll probably have smaller crocodiles. It kind of makes sense. Yeah. That's probably what dragons were probably where a bunch of people that never experienced crocodiles before and just got fucked up by these 20 foot Crocs.


Imagine seeing that and not knowing what it is. Dude, What does Joey Behar say? Joey Whatever. Joey Behar. When she's, when people tell like, Hey, so that, that's not True. I just wanna say for the record, I have no hate for Joey Behar. If I saw her, I give her a hug. I don't care. I'd probably say the same thing about me if I was her. It's no big deal. I don't care. But it's a silly thing to say. And it undermines your own personal credibility. Credibility. Yeah. If you say we're so good because we're we're supported by a, B, C news. And then you say, Joe Rogan plays the dragons in the next sentences And no chance she comes back goes, oh guys, it wasn wrong. Somebody told me the wrong shit. If it was a joke, that would be funny. I know she wasn't joking, but it would be hilarious. It would be hilarious. Joe Rogan, the guy who fucking believes in dragons spot. I wonder if there Were Some kind of flying lizards at one point in human history.


You know, here we go. If you go, well, this is what the Bigfoot myth is about. The Bigfoot myth is about a thing that really existed. It's called gigantic pitus. But it lived like a hundred thousand years ago. So by the time at least we think it did, we know for sure no later than, I mean later than that for sure. A hundred thousand years. We don't know earlier. It might've been earlier. It might've lived 50,000 years ago. We just don't have an example of it. But it wasn a thing. It wasn passed on in stories. It's dead now. It doesn't exist anymore. Yeah. But people were telling a story about a thing. It wasn real. That's probably what dragons are. It's probably people telling a story about a thing. It wasn real. And if a hundred, 200,000 years ago there was some reptiles that could fly. We know that pterodactyls were fucking real. They just find one of those things.


It would change everything. And you gotta realize they've only been finding dinosaurs for 200 years. Hmm. 200 years ago. They didn't know what the Fuck when the Jews started burying those bones. Well there was a bunch of dudes who had fake dinosaur bones. He was trying to trick us. Don't attack us. It's been nice weather, direct. You Know, there was a bunch of dudes who put like other bones and claimed they were dinosaur bones. There's a bunch of frogs. Well, Dinosaur Jewish dudes. I had, there's money in bones. Jamie, When did they, when did They discover Dinosaurs? This alright, you look like a pterodactyl. Imagine discovering dinosaurs going, oh, is this still around? I think most of them at the White House Be Pelosi, get out. She's filed For reelection.


Ah. She's like 79. She's 84. 84. With those Dips she just fired for Yeah. Pretty huge Cans. When did the 1824. Okay. So exactly. Exactly. 200 years ago they found the first dinosaur. Damn. They've Only known about dinosaurs for 200 years. Wow. What? And there's a giant chunk of the planet that has not been discovered. And like we, we had a podcast the other day. They've only like looked at 5% of Sub-Saharan Africa. They find whale bones in the Sahara Desert Out there. Yeah. That's pretty cool. Hell yeah. Whale Bones. That's fun. In the desert. Who knows what the fuck's out there. Oh, it's not impossible to imagine that since there used to be flying lizards. At one point in time there were 1677. Someone discovered it.


1677. Oh giant. So it created giant with discovering the first dinosaur bone. But his best guess as to what belonged to was a giant human. Oh wow. Wow. So it so funny to find like a giant femur and be like, God bro. Damn. That guy was huge. That's My favorite conspiracy giants. The giants used to roam the earth and that, You know, they were created by the Anunnaki breeding with people. I Believe it. I'm down. And then the government, the Smithsonian has been hiding giant bones. You know, they made ya Ming, they got the two tallest people in China to fuck. No, That's a good move. Yeah. For real.

I was in Cuba, so me and Bobby were like researching like the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Bay of Pigs while we were there. And then man, how close it was with that submarine. Three outta four Russians were like, we, we can't talk to Russia.


Yeah, yeah, yeah. So like, there must be a reason for that. I bet they're attacks. We should launch. And one outta the four. I Was like one guy. Yep. Hold on though. Save The entire world. Let's wait an hour. Yeah. Jesus Christ. That's how close it was. If he launched and then America would've to launch. Well, You know, I know we're supposed to support the bros, but the guys on the fucking nuclear subs that like, they're only, they're gonna just destroy the world.

Not even, that's that Where, where that we're so close that Russians had to warn the United States.


They were launch that missile at Ukraine. Yeah. 'cause it would end the world. Yeah. Whoa. Is that why Ellen left? So it's the first time one of those missiles has ever been used. It's based on an intercontinental ballistic missile. But they call it a mid-range. So it's a mid-range ballistic missile. And it easily could have a nuke on it. So when they launched it, they had to let the United States know that they were launching it. But they didn't say if they had a new coner or not. Oh, really? No. Shit. Bay pigs was Wild. I don't think they said Let's Google that because what I read said, I Thought they had to say, they had to have said, there's no way. Give it A goog. Do they? You think they said said I, they Said true. This is just a show. That's true. Because I Didn't Is that would've ended the fucking world.


The thing that I read said that they didn't, I do not know if that's true though. But there, so it's so hard to know what's true and what's not that. Right.

The stuff that we've seen is so small in comparison to the stuff that we have.


We have stuff that would wipe out entire shelves of the continent. Let's do It. What is that? I mean, you would, you would kill like everyone in the UK instantaneously. Good. There are Just launch. Get some Brit, Get some fluoride first. They, They really wanted to go ham those teeth. You know, if there was some sort of a, a real nuclear war and a bunch of them launched. Yeah. And you, you hit Chicago with three big missiles with nukes on it. Those things are a thousand times stronger than the Hiroshima bombs. A thousand twice would be enough. Let's See what the, to what the total is. How, what the, what is the most powerful ballistic missile that carries a UFO bomb? What can it do? Look at this.


Yeah. Those. Whoa. What? Whoa, Whoa. Are those real? Nothing's Like It raining down. It almost looks like the reverse footage of missiles firing Jamie. Yeah, it does. Jamie. How much more powerful is, are today's nuclear bombs than what they use in Hiroshima? It's some insane. And how Much more Powerful is today's weed than the seventies weed?

This is always gonna be Aer that just killed Jaguar. Like fucking kid. Rock Hill Bud Light. I mean, What were they doing? What was that? What are they Doing? What was that? You didn't see the Jaguar A Okay, Jaguar. Most of my news from being on this podcast, The Jaguar good. This is reliable. I'm like a, B, C news. Ja. The Jaguar ad is the fucking craziest speech. The guy gives a speech like it's four years ago. Wait, like he's in the throes of the fucking BLM movement and like the, the woke ist of woke times. Really? He should be wearing a mask when he does this speech. Oh, here we go. See if you can find the speech. The, the ad is ridiculous. This, Yeah. This is Jaguar.


What is this? The Olympics? This is sports cars. Alright. What's not so bad? It's kind of cool. Yeah, it's pretty cool. What up to the cars? A lot of colors. Well this is just weird. Which is is fine. I like weird Target. Yeah. This is just the 32nd A. Okay. Yeah. But I'm asking for the press conference. Is that Megan Rapino? So the pre the press conference is where the guy starts talking. It is. The ad is just weird. But then the press conference, the guy talks about how inclusive they want all diverse. And this is, is you got wrong ones. Jacksonville, Jaguar. Shout out Gabe Davis. Gay, gay Davis. Just Gay cornerback of all Time for a while. It's, and a bunch of nonsense. And the way, the way they say it, it's just like, what are you, are you selling cars or not?


Like why, why are you selling this political ideology? I thought you Made, well you ever Sports Cross? You ever see, you ever see Century The Self? Yeah. Hell yeah. What's that? They're no, they're no longer selling the thing that has Adam, Adam cur. They're no longer selling the thing that has the value. So like pianos stop going from like, this is a good Steinway piano with good sound to this will bring your family together. And when you see the guy from fucking True detective going, the freedom I get from driving on the road, it's, that's have nothing to do with your motor. That they're selling that to everybody on every front. It's Like Subaru Made with love. But this thing you're selling. Yeah. This thing you're selling is not your audience. Yeah. Your audience is Don't wanna hear cars. Oh dude. The Jaguar crew. I see The Commercial fucking badass. They're pretty cool. They're badass.


Not anymore. They make, that's the problem. They're bad ass for guys like us. The Jaar is always in the shop. It wasn the, it wasn the thing. That's True. The new ones are more reliable. They say about every single car. No, no car. I think the new ones are owned by Ford. Actually. They bought 'em. Yeah. Look, the New Jaguars, the the V eight coop is a fucking beast. It's an an amazing car. I don't know. I think this is a different, they hired a guy. Did you find the press conference? Uhoh Jam o's Drunk Scrubbed it. Kamala scrubbed it. I type it in. It's just people complaining, like making videos. Complaining about I can't find, I guarantee you can find it. You gotta go Reddit. Remember the Trump Joe Rogan episode and you searched Joe Rogan, Donald Trump. And it was like they fucked us a bunch of fucking reaction videos came up first. Yeah. They Fucked us.


They made it impossible to find the video. And we had a complaint and they said it was an accident. Ah. But like, how did this accident Happen? They wouldn't say, see, here's the thing. Like maybe there's a way that you can, this is me completely speculating. Okay. But maybe there's a way, like I don't like Ari Shafi. You don't, and I run, you don't. Some Sort of super you don well known. So I run sort of, sort of a super pac or I think Ari Shafi has a podcast. That's dangerous. Yeah. And it might, I I might be able to do something Don't by mass complaining about your podcast. Like mass flagging it. Right. Okay. Like if I, if I have a bot system and I can get like a million people to mass flag your video, maybe it gets put into a category where it's more difficult to find They Do that.


I'm just imagining if I ran a company And it was potentially like a beheading Taliban video And it got mass flagged, you'd want it really hard to find. So you would hide the actual title of it. You would make it so it's difficult to search. Yeah. I guess I'm just being as charitable as possible. Yeah. Okay. Right, Right. That's what I could imagine. So I don't, A bunch of people said fuck This. Now I don't think they want people to know that that's possible. So when you ask 'em how did it happen? They don't give you a straight explanation. 'cause if that's the case, and this is again, that's scary completely me speculating. But if I'm speculating and that you find out that that's a thing. And I bet somebody does know it's a thing. If It is a thing, they definitely don't, aren't publicly known because then it's all these other foreign countries.


Anybody who wants to stifle any kind of news story, anything could just start using this process to hijack their system. No, anytime I've come into public fire, it's like the videos that have nothing to do with it go lower because people are just like, let's just flag them. So you have, like you said, a thousand people flagging it. The bot goes, this is probably problematic. Yeah. And they don't, they don't have the time to be searching everything. The amount of shit that gets posted every second on YouTube is mind blowing. Yo, can we talk about that Trump minutes every year That Trump Insane about going, we're not gonna do that shit anymore. Oh Yeah. It wasn nice. That's, that's the only one I've tried to explain to people. Like what I'm trying to, in the kindest way possible. And I, and I, this is what I've come up with. When I make fun of the dead golden girl, they can't ban me for bullying anymore.


Betty White. Yeah. They'll have to go. That's definitely not bullying. We won't ban your account. You can actually get an answer. But I wanna hear what he said. 'cause it was So, it hyped me Up. I Well what he said is that you cannot have censorship on social media sites and you can't have the government interfering with with free speech. Don't see, I said this video anywhere. I only find I watched the video. Jamie, I'm, I watched it. I'm not saying You didn't. I'm just saying I can't Find it. Okay, well keep looking. You need some regularly. You can't have faces of death up there. Keep looking. 'cause I know you can find it. I, I doesn't, it only shows that this is the source of it as the Financial Times. It says it was an interview.

In July, Duncan changed my Wikipedia to go. Ari doesn't have any ju Gold but he's hidden it among his friends. How the fuck do I know? Boy, you can't find it Jamie. You're right. Also the only people that I type in Jaguar in that guy's name. Literally it says no results. This is crazy. Wow. They pulled the video. It must have been such a disa. They must be so terrified of things like this of people like us talking about it. Shane's about to get into the sponsorship. Yeah. See if he can find his quotes.

We need to reestablish our brand And it damn a completely different price point.


It wasn a tweet. I saw that. Oh, Okay. I quick. A little too smart. Look at this. We need to move away from traditional automotive stereotypes. Glover said that while the overall buzz the new campaign had been very positive. Look, that ad didn't bother me at all. I thought the ad was cool. Yeah, so cool. The things that he was saying, vile hatred and intolerance in the comments regarding the individuals that appeared in the video. Well, that I don't agree with, but what I do agree with was, so things that he was saying were like crazy. Like you're supposed to be a car company. Tell me how awesome your car is. What are the quotes though? Dude, that's not, that's not his quotes. You gotta look at Matthew McConaughey talking about Lincoln. It's got nothing to do with the car. It's the same shit. They all do the same shit. Yeah, But There not an idea. No, this is weird. This is a press conference.


There's no car, this commercial. Okay. But this was a guy on stage it wasn saying all these crazy things. That's Yeah, that's what everybody exploded about. That's what you can't find.

Oh, I see him at clubs all the time working out his bits. What Is that? Share? So I don't respect grind. The audience members had varying accounts of the comedian's words. Two of them claim that Fox said did. He was responsible for what happened to him.


That he's the one who called the FBI On Diddy, who's currently in prison awaiting trial and sex trafficking charges a source close to Diddy insisted to daily mail that there is no truth to Sean Combs putting Jamie Fox in the hospital. There's No chance it was a joke. I mean, yeah, it was a joke. A joke based on truth or nacho truth. It is possible. That's totally possible. I trust the Daily Mail. That's totally possible. But it's also possible. He was ex explaining why he wound up gonna hospital and he hasn't talked about it since. He never talked about it. Look at this big homie. Cc, a celebrity security guard claimed in an interview with Cam Capone news last week that Fox was poisoned by Diddy. I know Combs poisoned Jamie Fox and Jamie Fox reported him to the FBI because of it.


Jamie Fox reported this man because to the FBI because of this, he claimed. So I've seen that video where that guy was talking about how Jamie Fox Reported. He says he was poisoned three times I think in it. Oh, he said it as well. He Says like, why do I have cyanide in my system? Jesus Christ. Why do I have, that's a good question. That's legit. Question died. Why do I have sign My system? This Jamie Fox wipes away tears as he gives his artistic explanation of mystery illness. Boy, I love tears and a comedy special. Hold up.

You don't care if they lie about their military rank where they served. You don't care if they lie about being an assistant. You don't care if they lie about Tianmen Square. There's too many things. This is so crazy. You, you would get fired if you were a assistant manager at a fucking oil changing company. Yeah. You would get Jiffy Lu would fired You. So lemme ask you a question though.

That's Pretty good. The Tulsi Gabbard. Yeah. All these people, RFK Jr. All these people are Very promising. The anti-war lady, Tulsi Gabbard going to Trump and the pro-war guy, Dick Cheney going to the other way crazy was like, that should kind of tell you what you need to know about international wars. How about The fact that the left was like openly embracing the fact that Dick Cheney voided Kamala. They weren't you Like, get outta here, Endorsed Kamala rather that they weren't going Like what? That's like Epstein endorsing you. You gotta Spin it. But no one was standing back and said, this guy's responsible for like, how many fucking people died in Iraq.

Do You know about the second of semi? Hey, are We doing the show in Mar-a-Lago? Well, we were Gone but, but you said I don't want to influence an election. I changed my mind after they shot at him. Yeah. That changed everything. Who do you think shot at him? CIA? No Crooks. Just one guy. No. And I think they, what, what's the saying? They fucking, they got rid of the goalie.


What's That saying? Pull the goalie. They pulled the goalie on that one. Defense wise, like the, I think they let a boy go. Keep in mind it Wasn In a BlackRock commercial. I just corrected you on sports. It is a weird one. He was in a BlackRock commercial and there's a cell phone data record. See if you can find this. So I don't fuck this up. Uhoh, there's cell phone data record of a phone that came from an area that's near the FBI headquarters back and forth to this kid's home. Oh, this kid's home was professionally scrubbed. Yeah. Wow. No silverware. That's weird. No, nothing. They hold on weird. I'm not done. Yeah, they cremated him 10 days after the assassination attempt. There's no toxicology reports.


If you find, if there's no press conference, if someone tries to shoot a guy who eventually winds up being the president-elect, you should at least find out if this guy was drugged, was he on crack? Like what was he doing? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You would do that. You would do that. And then you release it publicly. He was under the influence of psychotic drugs. You would do something, you would want to know at least everything at there should be an account of how this happened. Probably unn, What went wrong. The only thing for sure, definitely the only thing that went wrong or the only thing that did happen rather was the head of Secret Service. That lady. The secret. The so the Whatever. Secret Service lady. I'm a little drunk. Yeah. The Secret Service lady. That lady got fired, but she didn't wanna get fired.


She tried to keep her job. Yeah. She actually like, tried to explain and the dumbest explanation there was a sloped roof. So She didn't have Yeah. Which there wasn't, But there, but also there was a sloped roof. Wait where the other snipers were on. Wait, wait. It was more sloped, sloped roof. So What, So it was too dangerous to have snipers up there. Oh. Someone who regularly visited Crook's home, but it wasn and work also visited a building in DC located in Gallery Place. This is the same vicinity as an FBI office on June 26th, 2023. Whose device is that? Hold On devil's advocate. I've lived in dc I've lived in the area. There's FBI stuff everywhere. You're, you're How, how close is cl? Oh wow. It Wasn Kid shot that close.


Someone Pa That's the same block. No, I think, I think the accusation was that they'd done it more than one time. Fuck. Wait. DC There it is. There it is. There it is. There it is there. Hold on, hold on. Sorry. We found a device linked to Crook's work that traveled to Butler, Pennsylvania on July. I see. Fourth and July 8th, sorry. Device stopped all activity on July 12th. On August 30th, 2023. One device linked, linked Crook's visited Allegheny arms. So this is the place where you got guns. So they tracked all of his phones and the people that visited him. So someone, There it is. That's a c That's a Stupid fucking watch.


Sorry. So someone visited, does that mean that it was the FBI that did something? No, it doesn't necessarily. It could be anything. It could be just a person that randomly happened to be there that went to that area. But it's kind of weird that they're not showing you the toxicology. It's kind of weird. There's no press conference. The guy tried to shoot, the guy was the president for four years and everyone's making like it's no big deal. Right. And and then when they asked him, they asked Kamala Harris about Secret Service protection. She's like, a lot of people don't feel safe. You know, trans people don't feel safe. It's like, there was like this crazy, oh, take on it. It wasn so nuts. Like, what are you talking about? That could be you. The crazy people are out there. You have to protect all of us high profile people that are running for president.


Do you believe in democracy? You have to protect them. You can't say everyone feels in danger. Ah, no one feels safe. I don't feel safe. Immigrants don't feel safe. Got shot. Trump, Trump supports him. Shot. He got shot. He got shot in the fucking head and out With the guy behind him that got killed. Miracle hit his ear. Yeah. He turned weirdly. And it works Up. It makes me feel like we're in a movie. Wasn't JFK yesterday? Is that right? Yeah. November 63, 20 second. Is that what it is? Yeah. I think it wasn yesterday. Whoa. And Does RFK have security yet? Oh, he's got a shitload Of security. Oh, there you go. Yeah. He's got a shitload of security. Tony has security. Of course. RFK has it. Well Tony has security. Before he needed security. Tony was Like, isn't it ko? They security.


They Have a throne. They each have a throne. I'm shitting on too much swords. Records Thrones. Tony rules. Oh, I love Tony. I Know, I, I've just, I think I've been nothing but negative so far. No, somebody brings up Tony. I'm like, shut up. We're goofing Good time. It's kind of crazy though that someone tried to kill him and it's kind of like an afterthought. No one cares about it anymore. It's strange. It Would've been the next Lee Harvey Oswald. If that guy shot Trump and killed him and then they killed that guy. That would've been it. We would've never known. It would've been just never known. It would've been just like the JFK assassination. 10 years from now. Lunatic fucking Giannis Poppas would be on some late night talk show with a video of The assassination. I got it.


No one saw before. He's Dick Gregory. Just like Dick Gregory did. Somebody would, You know, Dick Gregory was a comic Dick. Dick Gregory, I've been researching him a little bit. Ruled, gave up his whole comedy career For Activism. Said I can't be a fucking accepted black while nobody else is Playing cool ass music. Oh, is this fucker, What is it? Are you Ringing? Watching you weirdo? Oh, that's your phone on Jamie Was setting us up for something. I'm like, what the fuck the fuck is going on? I dunno what you're talking about. I was like, Jamie, what is this? That's hilarious. That's your ringer. You No, no, no. It was an ad on a fucking f Precocious Bastard. Oh, you were watching something?


Well pissing. I was looking at sports court. Yeah. Dick Gregory's, one of those guys. And I'm mad that I didn't go to one of his shows. I saw one because he had a show in New York and I was thinking of traveling and going to see it. And I didn't go to, I saw him at the DC Improv. Oh, not DC Grove. John X rent a room. And I saw him there And it was three and a half hours long. Oh, whoa. And it was, that's too much. And it was, he gave up his whole career. 'cause I can't be an accepted black man while none of my cohorts are accepted. Fuck this. What do you mean? He goes, I can't be accepted by whites where nobody else is in the sixties. This is a long time ago. A different time. Osby was accepted. And he goes, I know I'm Yeah, But a different time. I know. He goes, I'm not gonna be that. Yeah. And they wrote a book called, called the N Word. Yeah. And but actual, and then now people are getting banned for suggesting it because of the title.


Right, right. But that guy, dude, that guy, guy underrated how crazy and influential and intelligent he was funny. A hundred percent. That's the whole thing about him getting that video. So he got that film from Time Magazine. Time Magazine had that film for 12 years. What film? The film with the Zapruder assassin. The, the Zapruder version of the assassination. So Adrian Zapruder was filming with a super eight camera, and he catches Kennedy's head exploding and his head going back into the right. And that threw this giant monkey wrench into the whole narrative of that he was shot from the school book depository because his head goes back into the left from a bullet that's supposed to come from behind him.


It doesn't make any sense. And then on top of that, there's a moment where he grabs his neck, which is the entry hole he got shot in the neck. So someone shot him from the front. But in the Bethesda Maryland autopsy report, that's a tracheotomy hole. Ah, in the Give it Up Montgomery Grill. But, but hold on. In the Dallas version of it, when the, when they got his body in Dallas, they said it was an entry hole. So there's a lot of contradictory evidence. This is all in, David Lifton wrote a book called Best Evidence. It turned me into a fucking loon. And so da And So I love how you push back on Trump with that. It wasn baller like chemistry. He goes, I read enough. He goes, how much? I plenty How much though?


Yeah. I enough. More than half or less than Half. Well, he wanted to win and I didn't wanna push too hard. Yeah, right. I'm like, I'm trying to like have a conversation with this guy where I'm gonna ask, one of the big things was like, you did ramp up the budget deficit. You, you did ranch up. You, you ramped up what we owe. Like, but what he explained that kind of makes sense. Is that what he was doing with getting rid of regulations, more American oil, what it was gonna stimulate the economy. And we were on our way to overcoming it. Then we got hit by Covid. Okay, that's reasonable. Because he did the deficit did increase significantly during his term because of tariffs, because of a bunch. So I was trying to figure out, like, I don't understand that stuff.


I just know what I read about it. I did my best to try to like, what's like a very important aspect of what he's talking about. Well, we're gonna bring the economy back. Okay. But during your time, the deficit did rise. So what was that about? So he had a reasonable explanation. His, his explanation was it takes time. We were on our way to coming back in a huge way. And then we got hit with Covid. Everything got shut down. That's all real. And then there's like a bunch of collusions as to why did we get shut down when he wanted everything to open back up? Did they want the economy to tank right before the election? Fucking Of course they did. Yeah, of Course they did. That's why they would lower gas prices right. Before an election. But, but yeah. But if what I've known about you for, You know, 80 years I've known you is JFK Assassination and Aliens.


What Are the moon Landing big ones? And it's like, if could tell, if I could see in any future of Joe Rogan talking to a former or a current president, he would ask those two questions. I was, I was a little disappointed with the it wasn, it wasn one of those moments. You ever hear someone say something dumb as fuck and you're like, oh shit, this guy's dumb. Yeah. It wasn like the, I don't think Trump's dumb. Yeah. At all. But there, But there, when he was talking to you about aliens and you asked him a question and he was like, yeah, Mars, who knows? And it's like, no, it's obviously not Mars. Well, you, He not that close. It's far, far away. It wasn the one moment where I was like, oh shit. You brought Up aliens, anyone to fuck those Pilots. We talked about aliens. He'd have to ask it wasn Crazy.


He'd have, ask about Area 51 and what happened. Those, It was the Mars, the Mars comment. That's one of those, like, one time I was smoking weed of my friend, we were looking at the stars and the shooting star went by and he was like, is that like a, that's a star flying through the air. And he like, no, no. You have no concept at all. No. What we're talking about, it's not At all, it wasn the same thing. Like with Trump, with the UFOs things. He was like, yeah, Mars is right there Also. There's a, a thing. No, but, but hold on. There's a thing about Mars that's fascinating. And one of the things about Mars, it's fascinating, is at one point in time, whoever, whatever billion years ago, it had an atmosphere. Yeah. And it was Probably, it was probably closer to the sun.


And it probably had life. It probably had something I think it wasn billions of years ago. And also Life. What do you mean by life? Some sort of biological life, right? I mean, I, I ABAs Yeah. Something. Now, whether or not there was actually human beings, dragon Dragons, Possibly. But what is it? The Dogon tribe? Is it the Dogon Tribe Dragons? Maybe. I believe in both Aliens and Dragons. How about that? There you go. Joy. And I also believe in Joy Behar. Hey, joy Behar. Joy Behar is a fucking comedian. Joy Behar is a comedian. Was was, but even was, I'll give it to you if you were like, we're in the same tribe. True. Like, I don't hate that lady. I I know she's lost, but they're all lost on that fucking show.


Imagine being on that show. You got an audience in front of you. You have seven minutes segments. You got a bunch of producers, you're on a, b, c news. Like shut the fuck up. That show sucks. You're, you're not gonna make it any better. You know? Yeah. But she's just a lady. She's a lady trapped in her own biology. She's trapped in her own age. She's trapped in the time she lives in. She's on a show where her and Whippy Goldberg are the matriarchs. Like it's chaos. Yeah. The whole thing's nuts. It is nutty. It's nuts. They, they need Barbara Walters to come back from the grave, come and start running that thing correctly Back. Oh. And if you watch when Trump went on, this is the crazy thing. Oh, we can play this Trump outta the view. I sent this to the group chat. We could play this now let's play this out. Trump on the View joined this. I did. I would not before years ago. And they blew it years ago.


No, they blew him. When, when Trump was here, I wanted to open up the show. This is my thought when I had him on. And I talked about it, but I didn't have that clip. 'cause I didn't want him to copyright Flag it. Pay America, fuck you on. No, I Didn't want him to copyright flag it because it's so crazy. I was like, this, this conversation I'm having with him is so important. I'm, I just like, let's just reference it. Let's just reference it. So the video is from like 2012. It's like, before he even runs for president, he goes on the View and they go, our friend Donald Trump and the whole audience. Cheers. Watch this. You've never seen this? No. Watch this. What? I sent it to the group Chat. 'cause he was a big, well Mark, I ignore a lot of your stuff. I, I understand. Where's The light? I get it.


Where's the light At? The light right here. Well, Barbara Wawa, Welcome my friend Donald Trump. They don't want to show that he was their friend. 2011. Why? It looks the same At the Cheers. Look at the cheers. Yeah. Hit a, hit a board game. Standing ovation. He Hit a board game. Standing ovation. Look at this. Sherry Shepherd. Hey, there she is. Look at this. Hugs, joy Behar. Joy Behar. Big hug and kiss. She says, My French. Look at that Bar. Walters Whoopi Goldberg. Big hug and a kiss. They just hugged Hitler. Who's the one hot chick? Yeah. Right. Elizabeth Hasselbeck from Survivor. She's a Republican.


Married to a fucking quarterback. But you're thinking, you've Quarterback and Hasselback. Look at this. I mean, this was amazing. They, they loved him. They sat down with him. They talked to him about how he's progressive and liberal when it comes to social issues, but economically conservative. And you might be a great president. Are you gonna run? And he was talking about it. Look how, look how they level. He Should not be having it from the jump though. Who cares? Is she still being There? She's barely alive. Look at, look at Joy Behar. Look at Joy Behar right next to her. All huggy kissy. Dude, Trump holds it down. Look at that. They're all over. They're, they're all hanging on his every word. They're all all hanging out with him. They're happy to be there with him.


You Ever seen him on Oprah? Oh yeah. It's amazing. He killed it. Oprah was, he's also asking him to run for president. The whole thing is nuts. That is smooth. He is a great way, way back in the day. Okay. Find out when Oprah go to Oprah asking Trump if he's gonna run for president. What, what we saw is the greatest media psyop in history. Wow. Did he say grab him by the pussy? Of course he did. Guess who else did? A lot of those people, especially back in those days, back in the days before the internet, people said wild. I gotta be honest, I say fond by the Pusy iy locker room Style shit. I'm listened. The whole thing. It's, It was a normal con. He was like, I'm rich. So girls let me do stuff. I'm famous. I don't Understand the, He Chappelle had a joke about that.


He goes, you left out the second part and you intentionally left out the second part. It goes and they let me, which implies consent. That's con That's exactly It. So you're, you're leaving out where they gave me consent to make it seem like didn't make Sense. It's being funny. Right. That's, he was really just grabbing people by the, it's a funny thing to say. Who does that? It's a ridiculous thing to say. Partly To grab It's like negative space. It's negative space. You two fingers in like a bowl. Remember the first time you try to grab it, you could grab it when you, when you were a young man, you that there thought, tell that to girls where my dick was. Tell that girls at bar front Way lower way lowers way lower. Fuck a belly button. Talking about children grabbing it. They've never seen their own vagina. But tell it to guys at bar. Girls at bars get grabbed all the time. There's a lot of scumbags out there.


Puy though. Pussy. Yes. 100%. I've talked to girls who've had their pussy grab by some douche bag. Who drunk at a bar. Oh wow. Yeah. Pussy grab it. Definitely grab a hold of it. Yeah. Shit. Face the Hooters. You go. All right, pay-per-view is over. Come here. That's grab touch. Oh, I'm getting kicked out and I'm getting kicked out. The point is, oh, Because I like the Raiders. See, watch this. This is, look At him. He's cool and calm and collected. This is from 1988. Yeah. That's it. Play it. They come over here, they sell their cars, their VCRs. They knock the hell out of our companies. And hey, I have tremendous respect for the Japanese people. I mean, you can respect somebody that's beating the hell outta you, but they are beating the hell out of this country. Kuwait, they live like kings. The poorest person in Kuwait. They live like kings and yet they're not paying.


I don't about that. We make it possible for them to sell their oil. Why aren't they paying us 25? This is before we invaded. It's A joke. This, this sounds like political presidential. Talk to me, and I know people have talked to you about whether or not you wanna run. Would you, would you ever? Probably not, but I, I do get tired of seeing the country ripped Over. Why would you not? I Just don't think I really have the inclination to do it. I love what I'm doing. I really Like It Also doesn't pay as well. No, It doesn't. But, You know, I just probably wouldn't do it. Oprah. I probably, probably, but I do get tired of seeing what's happening with this country. And if it got so bad, I would never wanna rule it out. Totally. Because I really am tired of seeing what's happening with this country. How we're, how we're really making other people live like kings.


And we are not What Do, what do you think of this year's presidential race? Good enough. Who Is 88? Good enough. Dukakis, Bush. Bush Dukakis. Yeah. So I love 88. What you're, what you're seeing with Trump, regardless of his flaws, what you're seeing with Trump, regardless of flaws, is a massive concentrated psyop. They've, they've distorted who he is to the point where most people think that way. Most people think that way. They've, they've had narratives, Reality. What is the psyop? I keep hearing that Psychological operation. Whoa. Where they've decided to distort people's Perceptions of things. Reality. Yeah. When you tell like a, like an older liberal that like the, the Obama deportations were higher than the trumpet deportations.


They go, no. What? No. And you go, no, just lemme just Google deportations. Obama is Trump. And you go, it's lower. They go, wait, what? Here's 19 straight articles saying, saying that I'm right. Yeah. Yeah. And they go, that doesn't make sense. And you go right. Focus on what's giving you the reality of the world. Check this out, Jamie. Go to that Hillary Clinton thing that I texted you today. Jam O This one is wild. What? This is Hillary Clinton in like 2008 and Hillary Clinton saying some wild MAGA type shit about, oh, she used to say wildest shit. Wildest shit about illegal immigrants. What up? Go, go. Go back from the beginning. Do it from the beginning. That that's the beginning.


It's okay. Do it from the beginning. It is. I mean, but I wanna hear it. I Think we gotta have tough conditions. Tell people to come out of the shadows. If they've committed a crime, deport them. No questions asked. They're gone. If they, She's a Republican. If They've been working and are law abiding, we should say, here are the conditions for you staying. You have to pay a stiff fine Because you came here illegally. You have to pay back taxes. Mm. And you have to try to learn English. Ooh. And you have to wait In line. Anyone else to wait in line. You have to wait in line. And everybody's cheering. So 2008, Hillary Clinton was more MAGA than Trump. She Has been a Republican. But how about that? Wow. More Maga than Trump.


It's all, And then you couldn't believe that if you watched The news. Fucking illusion. It's all a fucking illusion. All of them, when convenient have said the exact same things. Dragons are real. Yeah. They it's crazy. It's crazy. They give you a false sense of reality and you just gotta shut them both off. Because they had control of the media up until now. Ah. This lecture was the first time they didn't really have control of the media anymore. Because what? Because of us non-mainstream media. Because of Podcasts. Podcasts. Selling tickets because of social media. Media because they're humanizing Trump like, well, is a human. Yeah. So why, why can't I I The other lady on, well, they're trapped. They've, they've been caught up in all this shit that they've shoved down everybody's throat. Especially all the Russia's shit.


Do you think the campaign people for Kamala Harris was going, we should have let her go on Rogan? Definitely. Or they, some people it wasn a no win. Some People maybe it would've been a win. I would've been nice to her. I told Her, you would've been nice. I Told her I will talk about anything. They didn't want to talk about marijuana legalization and they didn't want to talk about internet censorship. She just smoked. But then they changed their mind about the internet censorship. And then they contacted and said they want to talk about internet censorship. We, we had like, no bullshit. At least I didn't have any of them. But there was at least three ca calls. There was like multiple emails back and forth. And there was dates proposed. This idea that they passed on it because the progressive people look, I'm sure the progressive people didn't want her to do it.


I'm sure there's people that didn't want her to do it, but they were trying to schedule it. This is not a thing. It wasn like they had resistance to it. They contacted me. Mm. They contacted me when they found out when Trump's camp leaked that he was coming on. They contacted me and they wanted to come on. They had contacted me before. They were inquiring about coming on. Once Trump said he was coming on, then they wanted to come on. Fuck. But they wanted me to do an hour and they wanted me to travel to them. Well, that's crazy. Yeah. But Like It, yeah.

And Joe's like, no, you're fucking making money off us now. Oh, the mothership Pay is like crazy. And you don't need the $600. It's not that. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, who was the guy who went in front of Congress and spoke about from, from Colorado, Rocky Mountain High. Oh, David Lucas. No Singing about rap. John Denver. John Denver.

Well, the store was like a great, a great place for us to work out shit.


But it was also like, wait a minute, why is the guys running the show making $6,000 and no one's making anything other than a couple of people? This is crazy. Like this whole thing's nuts. But it's like, You know, if you let person people do that, they're gonna do it. Of course they're gonna rip people off of you. Let 'em rip people off. They're gonna rip people off. Ah, You got that right. Jesus Christ. It's just one of those things. If you, if they don't get checked, I mean, that's what happened if unions didn't exist. Yeah. I mean, if you unions didn't exist, you imagine if you just pay people whatever you want to pay 'em and then all these illegals are spilling in child Labor. Fine. Yeah. Fine. No child laws, no child labor laws. We'd be fucked. Are you saying comedians need a union?


Nah, that'll never work because there's too many cunts. Don't Turn against each other. Time clubs Run. The Italians having a union. No, you really need clubs run by comic. If all clubs were run By comic. Are there any That's a Horrible idea. Well, I think there's a couple other ones. The one at Key West, that guy is a comic runs To it. Tom Dustin that plays Great is Brett Garrett's Club. That, that Joe List Documentary is killer. The funniest documentary I've ever seen in my life. We saw it in the theater. Yeah, we saw it. Angelica, because it's about a comedian Portrait of a comedian. Isn. Where Can you get it? He, he just got a deal to be in theater. They, They're in theater, so it's gonna come out eventually. Nice on. But it was just a comic being a comic. And that's the documentary. He's not playing it up.


He's just A, I think the best case scenario is every comic who gets a pile of money, he should invest in a club. That's the best. I think. Like It should be. Chap Chappelle did it. He did it. But you were on acid that one time when you were talking to me. You're like, don't ever open a room. It sucks. Bullshit. Just no Acid talking. It's casual. That's compliant. You like this? I was, I'm like, it's a lot of work. But that we, we ironed out a lot of It's work, man. Work. It's work. It's work. But it's worth it. All right. It really is worth it. I was at, hold on. No. Yeah. Shane. Shane. Never. You're misquoting me. I definitely never said never open up a room. I said, it's a lot of work and you have to have a lot of money. You have to, you have to be willing to not make money. Yeah. And most things that people do where they invest a lot of money, they wanna make money.


Yeah. Oh, My thought was like break. If anybody has the ability to do it the right way, it's me. Like I have to do it. Like I have to do this. What I would, if I was a kid and I was looking at like comics that had a lot of money, ah, if I had that guy's money, You know what I would do? We all, I just Open up About that. Right. I'm like, well, I just do it. Yeah. And it's a, it's a hit. And then you can just go, you have a billion dollars. Like, why do I fly to make money? Why do I, why fly to make a hundred grand? I can just go here. That means nothing to you. It's also so, so much easier on your life. Yeah. You don't have to fly all The time. Drive in, flying all time. Come back sucks. Hear Always tired. Yeah. You get worn out all the time. Flying just fucking kills your immune system.


You're always exhausted. Agreed. Right Now. Yeah. Jet lag Is The, I gotta go a day early now So I don't get sick. Yeah. And you have to drink a lot of water. And You hit the gym and your body has to reset. You're like, what The fuck? Oh Shit. What were You saying? Oh, I was gonna say, I was at, I went out to Ohio for Chappelle's birthday this year and did his show and all that. And then we, after we did the outside show, we went to his club and he was hammered. It was get outta here, it was his birthday and he was just up on stage holding everyone hostage, hammered. But he, he said the funniest shit. He was just up there and he is like, I worked my whole life to build this club to bomb in front of you motherfuckers.


It was so good. And it was just all these people standing there like, but he knew. He knew it wasn't going well. Yeah. He just kept going. It was so funny. He'll keep going to try to find the nuggets. Yeah. And he will, he's a minor. He the craziest thing. He'll find it. He's a minor even He's A minor blacked out. Yeah. He will find it. Yeah. Yeah. And then once he finds it, that piece, they'll save, they'll edit it. He'll put it aside. Yeah. And then it'll go, okay, now I got a chunk. I like also, when he, when it doesn't go well, he's like, gimme that ta that, that's fucked. Gimme that tape. I can't do that again. It's, he Still feels It. He's a minor. That's why Jeff Ross likes him. Well, you cut that. Cut that Jimo.


And we're back. We love Jeff Ross. Funny Guy. You've gotta be able to like make the, You know, we used to do that a lot. Damon Wayans. He used to go up. You remember those days? So funny. He would Do 15 of intentionally bad. Yeah. Really? So You would, so you would like no expectations. You've lost trust in me. And now I can try my jokes. Yeah. He calls it a jazz set. Yeah. He would fuck around. Damon has recorded like every show he is ever done since the nineties. Damn. That's old. Psycho to this day. To this day. He sets up, I saw him in the improv a few years back before Covid. And he set up a camera in the back room. I go, you do this every set. He goes, every set. And I, I watch him on my computer. He records all of 'em. He has 'em all archived and he riffs.


That's how he comes up with shit. He just gets up on there and starts talking about something, anything that's in the news, he starts riffing on it and then he'll find something. Yeah. And that's how he writes. I feel that's too self-indulgent. I feel too guilty. It depends what level it is. I Feel he's Famous. You can't do it in the garden, but like you could, you could do it at New York Comedy Club. Yeah. You Just fuck around. I can't. You gotta be willing to bomb. Yeah. You gotta Willing to bomb. Which is the hardest. But that's his creative process, You know. And Chris Rock used to do the same thing. He used to go on and just ramble about stuff and you'd tell the audience, relax. Relax. This ain't gonna be funny. Lower Your expectations. Yeah. It's Do on purpose. But eventually it would be a HBO special or a Netflix special And it would kill. But it's a process. Well, I gotta say I've been watching Louie of over the past couple months, he's back doing shit.


And he was struggling to put it lightly. And then I saw him two nights ago and all that same shit is killing. Yeah. Because he is willing to do it. It's crazy. Same material. Just slightly. Yeah. Just tweeted tweet. I saw Martin at the store come back after five years off Martin. And then he was like, not go six months later. Same material crushing. Yeah. Same Material. Not just like, I'm abandoning this. Just figuring out. They said that about prior the, the week he did live at the sunset trip, that he was doing the same material at the store and bombing. Mm.

And I literally, the last day I worked at Great Woods Performing Arts Center.


I was at a Neil Young concert and a riot broke out and I fucking threw a hoodie on him, my security outfit. I'm like, I'm outta here. I never got my last paycheck. Oh wow. A fight broke out in a Neil Young concert. You're Like, fuck this. Oh, It was crazy. My friend Larry punched some dude in the chest. And Larry is like, my friend Larry was like the Larry Jones shout out to Larry Jones, one of the nicest guys ever. And, and this guy was fucking with him. And he just dropped this guy. And I was like, oh my God, we're fighting. I'm outta here. And they left and there was bonfires going on on the lawn. It was chaos. They shut the show down. Whoa. This is a fucking Neil Young show. What was he doing? 1989? This is 1989 for him. White people decide to go nuts. They go nuts. Nuts. Well, You know what it was, it was cold juice.


It was cold at night And it was fake. The lawn fake. Yeah. There was a whole lawn area. And the lawn area was like a, there was like an amphitheater and then it wasn covered. And then above the outside the covered area was a lawn area. And the lawn area. A bunch of dudes started lighting like cardboard boxes on fire. They got crazy. They were, they had bonfires going on and they were got, they got real rowdy. Yeah. And then people were like, starting shit with the security guys. And then when my friend Larry dropped this guy, like fights broke out. I'm like, see ya. Put my lid on. I'm like, I'm leaving. Like it. As long as my friends weren't actively in fights, I'm like, let's get outta here. And everybody got outta there. I was like, I quit. I'm, I'm outta here. I just was ready to quit already. There was too many times where it was like almost fights.


Yeah. Some guy tried to run over me with his car. Whoa. Wait, wait, wait. What? What? Yeah. Yeah. What? Yeah. What happened? I was telling the guy that he had to stop 'cause we were like moving traffic around. The guy like got right up to my leg with his car and revved the engine. Whoa. And then I got up to his door and I, and I go, Hey man, fuck you. And he tried to open up his door and I knee the shit out of his door and put a giant dent in his door. What? So he couldn't, couldn't open it. And we were like, ready to fight. I was like, dude, I'll fucking kill you. And he was like, ready to get out the car. And I like, need his car door. And then a bunch of other security guard came up and he pulled, I'm like, what am I doing? I get like 20 to $5 an hour. Something like that. Right. I'm gonna get in fights. The first day on the job, they beat the fuck out of a guy who stole a golf cart. Whoa. Whoa.


That there was a dude named Ali Kat. He was the head guy that ran security. He was like this grizzled old security dude who'd probably been doing it forever. And they found this kid who was drunk, who stole one of our golf carts, a security cart. And he was driving around. They tackled him and they were beating him with a walkie talkie. Whoa. Like beating him bloody, his face was bleeding. And this was like my first day on the job. I was like, oh my God. Like we're doing this. Whoa. I was like, this is crazy. But didn't you, you were a juujitsu guy? Well, I was TaeKwonDo guy back then. TaeKwonDo? Yeah. You know, get dirty kick. No, I, I never got in fights. I never, I was the first guy to like, bye. I was like, I'm not interested in any fights. He didn't wanna apply your knowledge. No, I applied it in the ring.


I was not interested. It Doesn't go his record if he fights a Brando. Well, It wasn't even that. It was just like, I knew how dangerous it was. It's like once you've actually knocked people unconscious and you, you It's scary. Yeah. The whole thing's scary. Like fighting people in a giant group. Like fuck this. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't wanna have nothing to do with that. But like back then, the, the security team was all black belts. This guy, one of the guys that we worked out with, he got a job there and then he came to us and said, Hey, you guys want a job? It's like 25 bucks an hour, you get to see concerts. I was like, fuck yeah. I don't remember what the, I'm making $25 up. I don't know what it was. And so there was like 16 of us. Oh wow. All these like assassins that like worked at this security place. But it was too crazy.


You get to see how drunk people. And then it was also when I, I understand cops in a very minor way Because it became us against them. Mm. It was us, the security guard against the security guards against the people who were the, the drunks that were, and it wasn like a mentality. There was like, you outnumbered, but it was also like a thought. Like we are the good guys. They're the cunts and it's okay to beat the fuck out of them with walkie talkies. And this is no internet, man. We're talking about 1989. This guy beat the fuck out of this guy with a walkie talkie in the face. Just whoa. Ba ba ba. Jesus Blood was clattering. He was getting fucked up. They rolled him over and tied him up. It was crazy.


Yikes. Was craik. And then the tackle. I remember this guy getting tackled off of the fucking golf cart. The whole thing was nuts. I was like, oh Jesus, this is like not worth. Yeah. Whatever. I'm getting paid And fighting is like, You know, I've been beat up a few times in my day, but one time I jump kicked a guy in the stomach and he lost his, he was like, and I felt horrible. I was like, ah, geez. I don't wanna be this guy. Yeah. Even in fights, you feel horrible. Yeah. The Guy Gets like, pummeled, but it's like in the street. It's so, or in the world. It's so dangerous outside of a competition because no one's gonna stop that guy from stomping your fucking head when you're unconscious. Yeah. Oof. Oh, right. There's No rules.


There's no rules. No one's gonna stop. Some guy from biting your nose off. G You don't know who you're fighting with is a crazy person. Yeah. Gouging your eyes out. It's fucking dangerous. Like anybody who just wantingly engages in random violence with strangers, you're just ask him to get maimed. Yeah. Especially if you fuck up and run into some guy who actually knows how to fight. And I'm sure you've all seen those videos on life. They're horrific, horrific guy, guy, guy doesn't know what he's doing and he just gets destroyed for the rest of his life. His life is gonna be fucked. His legs. He's gonna be limping forever. 'cause some guy decided to snap his fucking femur in half. Oof. Yeah. It was like Scary shit, Man. I went to LSU that there was this place called Tiger Land.

Unintended, calm down Right now. It was the universe. The universe was telling us everything was fucked up. Yeah. What she was saying was fucked up. It was almost like God was like, you are not getting away with this.

Oh there's A camera that Broke. 100% he's gonna walk on, if we do Mar Largo, Let's do it and play the day after the play. The day after or Right. Then we Talked about it on the podcast and Don Jr reached out to me. He said, I can make that happen. Shit. I post, holy shit. I posted a support of Tony Iff and Don Jr. Was like, I love it. Whoa. Yeah, We can make it happen. Don Jr. Isn't It interesting DJ that like, like John Jones. We just need defend the heavyweight title. John Jones defends the heavyweight title and then does the Trump dance. Yeah. And then Crazy gives his belt to Trump. Like the world's changed.


Like everything's flipped. Yeah, completely. It's, it's completely flipped and like, And what's lost is John Jones is the greatest fighter of all time. He's a Gladiator. Yeah. He's the best. I mean the NFL guys are doing it. It's hard to say. He is not the best. And I know he didn't beat Tom Aspenal and he hasn't fought Tom Aspenal yet. Tom's great. There's always one guy, but it's like he's beating that guy over and over and over again. Dropping some rate fucking off. He's never fought. A guy like Tom. Tom's different. Tom's gonna be a problem man. He's a giant dude. He's fighting An Retiring. He's a legitimate heavyweight. He might fight whoever he wants to fight. Yeah. John Jones could do whatever the fuck he wants to do Right now. If I imagined what's actually happening though, I'd imagine he's saying he's not gonna fight Tom Aspenal.


Although he's probably training for Tom Aspenal and he wants to ramp up the amount of money that he can get. Oh, alright. Which is a smart thing to do. 'cause it might be the last time he fights. Also underrated. What nobody says about John Jones is he has, of all the UFC fighters ever met the highest weed tolerance of anybody and no one's talking about it. That's Crazy. Screwing Coke. He does four times a weed. Joe does four, five times a weed. I do. Really? Hannahs like a champion on airplanes. I Bet Nate. Allegedly Nate Diaz Can get After allegedly Bring it Nate v John Weed. I bet John's still more coherent. Dana, bring it Nate for John Weed. We all want see it. Let's do That. I'll take on that. Did you guys ever see, what was that Juujitsu competition? What was it called?


Where they would High rollers. High rollers. So they would get super baked and then they would've jujitsu competition. So they'd smoke together. By the way, that's Eddie's class. Yeah. That's Eddie's class every day. Yeah, it is. It is a little bit. But that's Matt, my friend. Matt put it together. And so he set this thing up. I think it was California where it was legal. So they all get super duper high and then they would fight. It was crazy. I love it. I love it. Weird. Just see matches. It was awesome. They should do that Coke version. Yeah, It wasn idiots. Good. Did you guys see that study that they funded? I posted it on my Instagram where they gave, gave Herb, was it gerbils or hamsters? They gave hamsters cocaine and steroids. Had them fight and like studied it.


The fuck was hamsters? It's on my Instagram. Studied our government. Our government fifth Grader. Our Government's Like It. A bunch of nerds with an limited budget. Hell here it's, yeah. Supposedly serious Northeastern univers in Boston for decades, I think they spent $3 million on this. By the way. Supposedly Serious scientists at Northeastern University. Look at my quote here. The government spent $3 million funding a study where they injected hamsters with steroids and cocaine and had them fight a completely ridiculous and unethical study. But I would like to see the data. I wanna see the data. This is why the terrorists hate us, bro. They hopped them up on cocaine and Roys and they had 'em go to war.


Wow. 'cause they were probably trying to figure out what's the best way to make a soldier. Oh right. Yeah. Yep, yep. I would do that. Like, You know, I've had conversations with like They don't, yeah, exactly. Well also I've had conversations with like special forces guys and you're like, you don't wanna like ask is everybody doing steroids? But one of them said the whatever that soldier needs to do to make him the best soldier, I am all in on this death. Otherwise you don't fuck me up one of the guys in the seals. I was asking him about that and I was like, you guys should all do steroids. What the fuck? Who gives a fuck? And he was like, yeah, but then you're out and you get stuck out there And you Run out and you run out and now you have a guy fucking falling apart. And I was like, oh, shit.


Didn't That's, think About that. That's a very good point. Because she should carry steroids. I was like, yeah, you guys should, everywhere You go, they should all be fucking on steroids. You guys should just keep steroids with you. Just have like a fucking box that can't be like a bulletproof box with testosterone in it and a fucking bag of needles that's attached to your hips. Let's go, let's go. Because they'll Yeah. I, I was like, make 'em the most rotted out freak of all time, Bro. When you see these people that are talking about like, non-binary folks in the fucking military and then you see China and they're doing bear crawls off hills. Oh. Have you seen that video of the Chinese military doing bear crawls up a giant hill? Yeah. I have not seen ever seen that. You ever do that workout? You ever do a bear crawl? I've done a bear Crawl.

Let's, while I'm sitting in there, let's, Let's fucking go. Come on man. Can I, I was at a ska show. We met some seals. Hell Yeah. Oh. And they go, Hey, I was in, I was in Yemen. They Say, what did they say? Beach Balls. Mark Norwin. You're such an important part of the show. The guy was in Yemen and I was undercover. Whatever embedded. And then I went to have to do these Dudes. Are You talking about that? Oh, that's hard. This is it.


This is it right Here. Oh, they're going up and down. That's hard. I think this is like a meme in China. I don't know about the military doing it. Oh no. I saw some military guys doing it. I know. I've Googled it. I'm not seeing 40. These guys Are fucking killing it. Anyway. It's pretty cool looking. That's hard to do, man. Whoever those guys are, we can't find enough Americans to do that. Hey, Kool-Aid Show the elephant walk that American Do we have enough American? Yeah. The elephant walking to McDonald's following Donald Trump's lead Look. Guess it's 80 people that do it. They their Bunch of nerds. Bro, that is so hard to do. Damn. The average age is 50. Whoa. Shit. That's crazy. They Just, somebody who's 68 Years old knows how old these Asians. You know what's Crazy though? Military Asian don't raise them. Well. Our ads are doing these fucking, these silly fucking inclusive things about the military.


Their ads are trying to make Chinese men more masculine. Like everything is more masculine. Well, that's, That's a fucking uphill climb. I think we're gonna flip though. I think that those days are over. I think they're over too. I think people realize how fucking dangerous it is to project this fucking insanity to the whole world. We never played that Trump fucking thing on the internet. It's all right. Which, it's not that great. It's him doing a Cool speech. It was, it got me riled up. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It's Find that Jamie, it, I I posted it. I posted it on my Instagram. You did? Okay, cool. Go To my Instagram, Jamie and you'll find it. 'cause it's, it's also with the words, So it's, the transcript is on the screen. Oh. If you don't want it, we don't have to. We're gonna do it. We want it. We want it. No, it's, you're right. You want it. You want It. It's super important.


We have all the time in the world, man. We're Americans. We're Americans. And Trump's the president. Fuck Nobody army. Start from the beginning and gimme a little volume. I Alright. Sorry. Every Time I can't. I know. I understand. Okay, go ahead. Go ahead. It's okay. Damn. Brolin's handsome. He's a beautiful man. Speech then we just don't have a free country. It's as simple as that. If this most fundamental right is allowed to perish, then the rest of our rights and liberties will topple just like Domino's one by one. They'll go down Domino's Pizza. Great. That's why pizza. I'm My plan to Shatter the left wing censorship regime and to reclaim Love. The right To free speech. Jamie comment for all Americans right now live, No, no, no.


Hold on. Let him. Very important word in this case because they've taken it away In recent weeks, bombshell reports have confirmed that a sinister group of deep state bureaucrats, Silicon Valley tyrants, left wing activists and depraved corporate news media, have been conspiring to manipulate and silence the American people. They have collaborated to suppress vital information on everything from elections to public health. The censorship cartel must be dismantled and destroyed. And it must happen immediately. And here's my plan. First, within hours of my inauguration, I will sign an executive order banning any federal department or agency from colluding with any organization, business, or person to censor, limit, categorize, or impede the lawful speech of American citizens.


I will then ban federal money from being used to label domestic speech as miss or disinformation. And I will begin the process of identifying and firing every federal Bureaucrat. Wow. Who has engaged In domestic censorship directly or indirectly. Whether they are the Department of Homeland Security should The Department of Health, human Services, the FBI, the DOJ, no matter who they are. Second, I will order the Department of Justice to investigate all parties involved in the new unlined censorship regime, which is absolutely destructive and terrible destruct.


And to aggressively prosecute any and all crimes identified. These include possible violations of federal civil rights law, campaign finance laws, federal election law, securities, law and antitrust laws, the Hatch Act. And a host of other potential criminal, civil, regulatory and constitutional offenses. To assist in these efforts, I am urging house Republicans to immediately send preservation letters. And we have to do this right now to the Biden administration, the Biden campaign, and every Silicon Valley Tech giant, ordering them not to destroy evidence of censorship.


Third, upon my inauguration as president, I will ask Congress to send A bill a million likes Revising section two 30 to get big online platforms. Two 30 out of censorship business. What time does an agent go to dentist party? Dumb as shit. Two 30. If they meet high standards of neutrality, transparency, fairness, and non-discrimination, we should require these platforms to increase their efforts To take down all jamo with all the tabs, the Content such as Leonard, skid Wolf, child Exploitation, and promoting terrorism while dramatically curtailing their power to arbitrarily restrict lawful speech.


Fourth, we need to up The entire. Alright. You good, Jamie? You, you good? You got it. We got it. Jamie. I Don't, I don't care if you don't like this guy. You can't be against this. That's a progressive idea. It's a progressive. Ooh. That is, it's Progressive idea. You have to able to go, I'm against 95% of 'em. This part is okay If you're not, if you're not with that, you're not with free speech. So you're not with free discourse. You, you want to be right. It none of it makes any sense. There's no logical explanation that you could possibly provide that would say that censoring speech by a bunch of people that have known, been known to be liars and criminals. Like, like letting those people censor. Speech is crazy. You're, you're letting people influence people with billions of dollars.


You're letting people that are engaged in really bizarre. Like the insider trading. The insider trading is fucking bananas. We, we let those people, these are the people that you're letting dictate what can and cannot be said online. Said online. You're trying to pretend that they don't have some sort of a financial interest one way or the other. You, you gotta let people talk. Anyone in the Arts, Andrew should Be in favor of that. Everyone Do whatever you wanna do. Whatever you Want to do. Express It in express. If you wanna make rap music, whatever you wanna make, you need that. Yeah. That's everything for us. For all of us. That's A great thing about rappers. They don't really attack each other for being inappropriate. They're terrified that if they go after to rappers, they'll lose the entire segment of the population that likes rap music.


Oh, interesting. Because everybody's sort of accepted that they, like if you listen to like old school Coogee rap or something like that, gangster music. You're accepting the fact this is entertainment just like a fucking Al Capone movie. And it's fun to listen to. Yeah. If you start going after those people and you demand that kind of censorship, you're gonna lose not just the people in the black community. You're gonna lose the people in the white community that like rap. The Chi Asian community, that Chinese, Japanese like name it. Everybody likes rap music. Everybody likes raps. Yeah. Leave us the fuck alone Asian rappers. Leave it. Leave us the fuck alone. And if you don't leave us the fuck alone, then you're gonna lose all the votes. So I don't think they can go after rap music. I think they have to leave rap music alone. Yeah. And it should be like, that's why they do say what you wanna say. Yeah.


Especially in the arts. And that's okay. Exactly. That's just Your stance. It's okay. You, you should be allowed to have all kinds of shit. Do you remember when Sister Soulja had that ramp? Oh yes. And Bill Clinton had this rebuttal to it on TV that probably won him the election. Oh Yeah. What was it? Wasn? He went Whitey. Yeah, she she was talking about like, here we'll play it. We'll play it. 'cause then I don't wanna paraphrase it 'cause we, we played it really recently. It's impo. It's Like it shows you how good Clinton was when he was in his prime. Oh yeah. Well the Dems lost Three years when he wasn't raping. He was fucking on fire Bro. I think. I think it's like him and Obama are the goats. Yeah. It's like the John Jones and the fucking George St. Pierre of politics.


Let's stand up for what's always been best about the Rainbow Coalition, which is people coming together across racial lines. Here, here The Rainbow Coalition was Jesse Jackson In Louisiana that you had here last night. A great role model. We don't have a lot of time to do this. We don't have a lot of time. Great hairline. God damn. You had a a rap singer here last night. Who named Sister Soldier. Oh mm. I defend her right to express herself through music. But her comments before and after Los Angeles were filled with the kind of hatred that you do not honor today. And tonight, just listen to this What she said.


What Ass pussy she told the Washington Post about a month ago. And I quote, if black people kill black people every day, why not have a week and kill white people? So you're a gang member and you'd normally kill somebody. Why not kill a white person? Last year she said, you can't call me or any black person anywhere in the world of racists. We don't have the power to do to white people what white people have done to us. And even if we did, we don't have that low down dirty nature. If there are any good white people, I haven't met them. Where are they? Right here in this room. That's where they're right here in this room. Shut up. I know she is a Young person, but she has a big influence on a lot of people.


And when people say that if you took the words white and black and you reversed them, you might think David Duke was given that speech. Ooh, That's a Good point. Lemme tell you. We all make mistakes and sometimes we're not as sensitive as we ought to be. And we have an obligation, all of us to call attention to prejudice wherever we see it. A few months ago, I made a mistake. I fucking Told a friend of mine said no. I said Shut up a country club that Didn't have any African American members. I was criticized for doing it. You know what? I was rightly criticized for doing it. I made a mistake. Good for Him. I said I would never do that again. And I think all of us have got to be sensitive to that.


We can't get anywhere In this country Pointing the finger at one another across racial lines. Don't Golf course if we're dead. Can't play it. Wasn a big deal. Even in Reverend Jackson's new math of this election. It's hard to get to a 34% solution or a 40% solution if the American people can be divided by race. Look at Jesse. Amazing. He was so good Ben, to admit you're wrong. No one ever does anymore. It's so Smooth. The way he did it was so smooth. Jamie, we platter. Oh Shit. Good speaker. Amy Bon hol. Cost One one B yet was enough for young Jamie. Let's get some steaks and go to Shane's house and grill 'em.


I'm actually totally all right with it. Wasn That your roommate La Mer. Yeah. La me's cool. He'll grill for us. La me will be put on the bow tie and do it. I Wanna put him out. He's gonna fuck it up. I'm gonna have to be the griller. Yes. Yeah, you'll grill. You know what you're doing. Let's actually, let's go do that. Let's do that. I'm in. I got pool. I turned the hot tub on before I Left. Turn the hot tub on Dude. Okay, Anything else? Should we cover anything else before we wrap this bitch up? Should we wait for Jamo? We have to wait for Jamo. We have to wait for jam. Otherwise it won't shut off. We Got Ellen leaving it. Wasn say something ridiculous. I'm like, oh no. Yeah, we talked Paul. Oh no, we talked to Jake Paul fight it Wasn so bad. No, it wasn a real didn't waste of time. That seemed like a sparring match.


The Jesse Smollett fight was better. Ah, I would like to see video of that. He got off by the way. I know Isn a while. Jesse mullet. He got off. I knew he was innocent the whole time. How did they get him off? What was the find out how Jesse, how got Off Jason, how about this? What would you want the tr the four years now? Would you want one thing to be done Over four years? Yeah. Release the JFK files. That's one. That's one. Stop the war. Stop the wars First. Stop the war. Gaza. Stop the wars first, mark. Well, I like the censorship thing. I like the censor's silly Censorship thing. Why don't I have to have one? I No, you're sure you're right. You're right. Wars. You're wars is number one. Wars is number one. Big wars is always gonna be number one.


I'd like to end the Cuba embargo. It doesn't seem they're doing anything the Instead. Absolutely. Instead the conviction was overturned because the Illinois Supreme Court ruled five to zero that a special prosecutor should not have been allowed to intervene after the Cook. County. County state's attorneys initially dropped the charges against Millette in exchange for forfeiting his $10,000 bond and conducting community service. Oh. So they shouldn't it wasn should have been punishment enough. And so they decided to make it public and make a big deal out of it. All right. That's reasonable. 'cause otherwise, was he going to jail? Did he have to go to jail? Ms. Pat? Ms. Pat was the best before anyone said it was fake before anyone. Oh yeah. She called it. She goes, I say I was day one.


She goes, she goes, motherfucker who's gonna wear, who's gonna use name brand bleach to attack somebody? Ah. She goes Right. Well that's funny. Here It is. A maximum of 15 years in prison. Oh my God. That's So crazy. Funds and made everyone think there's racism when there's none. He's an actor. It's like a baby that like bit an electric cord. Yeah. Bridget said the best Bridget face said the best. You can't let the actors write the fucking script. Well, Actors write everything now. They're All tweet tweeting. Well that's like the Johnny Depp trial too. It's like there's, there's certain times where the actors get involved in their own script writing and get pretty nutty. Yeah. Johnny Depp during that interview was so funny. 'cause when they're like, what's this box for? Is it Coke?


And he goes, yeah, yeah. I mean what fuck do you think's in there? Yeah. Yeah. You know, Isn't it crazy she put on makeup and said he beat her? Like she just completely lied. Well some people do that Know the people are like, well maybe she's A point. He was originally sentenced to 150 days in jail, 30 months of probation in order to pay a fine of $130,000. He only spent about one week in prison before being released. Because You did what they wanted pending appeal. God damn. They put him in jail for a week though. Oh They Did? The whole thing's stupid as fuck. But it's just an attention grab. No one's a victim of it other than everybody's sensibility. Like there's no real victim of it. Like if he victimized someone, I would see, I think the public humiliation of people finding out that it's like it's enough.


We don't have to cage people for something stupid. It's a stupid thing. And it's also a stupid thing from an actor that's involved in this bizarre industry that props people up for no reason then shoots them down. It's a fucking chaotic, bizarre way to live your life. And you're probably insane if you're involved in it. But it's a good sign for our country that like, hey, this thing actually didn't happen. It's crazy. He had to make this up. Yeah, it's great. This shit doesn't happen in the streets. But but's also, it is just like an actor writing. This is a magar country bitch. You're in Chicago. Yeah. What country The fuck are you talking About? Pour bleach off. Bad God. They wanted it so bad to be this thing And it, here's my favorite part. It wasn Cool. My favorite part was when he walked in with the noose still around his neck.


Like, you have to leave the noose. You don't take the noose off. 'cause no one, no one's gonna believe you. Right. Jesus Christ. It is like when I wear a fucking festival armband six months later. Yeah. Oh my God. How cool. South by Southwest. You're amazing. You see the new Robert Rodriguez movie, you're amazing. You still got your October 7th band. I about It. Wasn a festival. Bro. If Trump can just stop both of those fucking things from popping off, that Would be great. It's worth everything else he tweets about. Yeah. Of yeah. That's That's the whole point. Get in. Let's avoid that there and stop this shit. Yeah. Just cool everyone down. Just chill out. Let's have a good time. We got a good, A good, I think his like feistiness kind of makes him his own worst enemy in a certain way.


Like in like why people hate him when he tweets. Like I hate Taylor Swift. It's Like his feistiness, his fucking, but that's also what kept him in this thing. So if I think about it psychologically, like I think about certain competitors in sports where fighting. There's people that are just like complete fucking maniacs like Michael Jordan and that's why they're the best. Yeah. They're complete maniacs. And the complete maniacs are oftentimes like not so good at controlling their initial thought. Yeah. I think Michael Jordan would bribe t like baggage handlers to get his bag out first. Because you bet with Scotty Pippin whose bag would come out first. Oh my God. I Think Trump's amazing.


Yeah, it wasn amazing. I think Trump's ego is like actually maybe a good thing. 'cause if 'cause he will do, did one lose to me what every everybody says he is like, so we're sitting here being like, he's gonna be the one to end the wars. And I think he'll be like, yeah I have to now I am the one that's gonna end the wolves. Oh yeah. Right. And I think he, I mean that's how I kind of look at it is like, I think so. So I think his ego is actually, I mean It is a positive. It is a good thing because I think he will. Yeah. He's gotta be like, guys, you've both done shit wrong. But but can we stop this? He did not drain the swamp. He did not Drain the swamp. Sucky. But that's a good question that I had for him. Like, what was it like making like 10,000 appointments? And he is like, we made a lot of mistakes. Yeah. We don't do it. Yeah. He's like, we, I, I've never governed before.


Like It iss essentially. And every time he's talked about this he said like you, you enter into this new thing. The gates man. The gates man was Matt Gates was, get the fuck outta Here. He's gone. Well He had a ba, he had a back down. It seems like he I know, but it's like, bro, if I see Like first Of all, if you're a dude with insane plastic surgery on your face, He's got the Botox. Get him Eyebrows. I heard he was obviously obviously Don't kill Matt Gates. No. But You know what you're saying bro. I heard he was Matt Gates, you gotta resign So I can appoint you to this thing. And then he resigned. He is like fuck off loser. Is that what he did? I Did you just make that up? No, somebody told me I didn't just make it Up. Wait, what it that Doesn't, he told Matt Gate, you gotta resign So I can appoint you and Matt Gates like what did I have to resign?


He goes, trust me, trust me. You resign. I appointed to this thing. Oh. And he goes, okay, I resigned. He goes not appointing you. No, I think it, I think it was Mac. Where Did you hear this Yesterday? He's Jewish Wherewhere. The comedy mothership at the tunnels at the temple. Somebody told me that. I don't even know who that guy is. The Tunnel was Are spreading misinformation. This is why they wanna censor internet. No Was I heard it was. I think it was. You're fucking at my Own show. So is he not a congressman anymore? RFK Jr. That's what a guy's supposed to look like when he's, he's his age. That literally healthy guy. Healthy guy. Ripped strong. Yeah. 70 years old. Yay. That's it. No fucking Botox. Yeah. You know botulism shot your fucking face. What is that stuff?


Is it Botulism him and Cheryl? Isn't that what It is still? Fuck you can tell Who and who. Him and Cheryl. Oh he definitely is Cheryl. Yeah. You can tell there she's How do, So I have some Respect. I'm about respect. I'm about, I'm, I'm about to slap our ass. Sounds like a car that can't start. That's an old Dana car. It's gonna be interesting to see what happens if that guy gets into a position of influence and power. He Takes my fruit loops. I'm gonna focus storm the capital Loop. I know a lot RFK but we are obese. We are addicted to opioid. We are Fucked up. That's true. But I have to tell you, I was looking at the images, the difference between the Canadian Fruit Loops and the American Fruit Loops online.


Yeah. And I'm willing to take the risk of the red dye. What do You mean? They look so much cooler trash. Look how much cooler they look. I'll tell you, show me the difference. Get a bowl today If you just eat a little bit every now and then. How bad is I read that. Give some colorful salt. I wished Them a few Years ago. The bottom. Listen, I am fine. I've eaten a thousand bowls of Fruit loops. I'm not doing that. Gimme the fruit. Let's take a look at what the fruit loops look like in Canada versus like look at that. I want gross Dead Fruit Loops. I don't want to eat it every day, but I want the one on the left. There's A push a few years ago to take 'em out and they did, but no one bought it. So they Put it back in. The one on the right. Looks like that generic stuff that you buy when you're poor. The bag, You know when it's like, yeah. Poor Four loops fruit cereal.


Right, right. Somebody Poor fucking fringe cereal. That's like generic cereal. Yeah. It looks Like it's got aids. That's why Canadians are sad. They have bad fruit loops. Yeah. Just don't eat it every day. You fucking idiots. Don't eat it all the time. Don't feed it to your cats. Don't constantly play me of sad Saskatoon. That's not nutrition. That's nonsense that you'd eat occasionally. Occasional nonsense is good for you. It's crazy. They tried to nail him on the Fruit loops and he's exactly right. I Know New York Times, They like Fruit Loops. It's like New York Times fact check them. Which one of you fucking dumb asses eating Fruit Loops and get, You know what I mean? It, they should do better With the say He's Don't eat fucking Fruit Loops. Right. Yeah. We have a health director that's like, yeah. Crush Fruit Loops.


But we've been pushing balanced breakfast for 30 years with the cereal, So I think Yeah, it's crazy. It's part of this balanced breakfast day. Yeah. LOL. Yeah. Fruit loops. It's Fucking eggs. What are you doing Kid? Yeah. Autism's up. Depression's up. All that shit's up. It's, this Is, there's too much money. There's too much money that's being funneled to people. That's really all it is. The the pharmaceutical drug companies make so much money. They have so much power. But I thought we cared about people's Health. But you're supposed to. They're supposed to too. It's not supposed to be, you shouldn't make any money. It's like you shouldn't make as much money as you possibly can while lying should Do it at that, at the, at the risk of everyone. But that's liberal. Everybody's still, but everybody's, that's A liberal Thought. It is. Everybody still needs pharmaceutical drugs.


Like they've come up with some amazing drugs that have kept people alive. But you can't let 'em just make as much money as they possibly can while lying. Right. That's the problem. It's like you have to know like how much of this stuff is safe and how much of this stuff is untested and what, what are the tests and are you being honest or are you just like making these tests work for you? Yes. Are you bullshitting? So if you're bullshitting, then you're trying to make more money than you should. You should still be able to make a fuck load of money. Yeah. Because there's a ton of pharmaceutical drugs that are awesome that people need, but you can't make as much money as possible while lying. And that's the, that's the thing. It's not like it's an non-pharmaceutical drug. It's an anti-human perspective to not look at it this way.


It's to say you're gonna allow these people that are only motivated by money to just wreck havoc on people's health for profit. And either you, you're cool with that or you're not cool with that. And if you're cool with that and you call yourself a progressive, that's kind of crazy. It's kind of crazy that you want an unregulated corporation that has a, a literal obligation to their shareholders to make the most profit possible. And then you get these fucking corporate assassins to run these things and then you have insane amounts of money that you're spending on the media. Yeah. There's no way anybody gets a fair shake at what the fuck is actually going on Advil's. Okay. Purdue's not, there's Even, You know, a lot of those things are not good for you, man.


That people take on a regular basis and you don't know it Because it's being hidden from you. Yeah. Follow your nose. You know, I read this story about this lady who had COVI and she was really hurting. So she took too much Tylenol. She died from liver failure. Whoa. Because If you take too much Tylenol, it'll fucking kill you. Really? How much take? I Didn't, it's be the last headache you ever had. If you just go ham and think the more Tylenol the better. You just start chewing on them. Yeah. You'll have a fucking real problem. Oh, I took like five today. Let's go. Everyone Did. Everyone should know that you should fucking, You know, You know that. I didn't know that. It's not that you shouldn't be able to get Tylenol. Of course you should have Tylenol. Everybody likes Tylenol. You get a headache, take Tylenol. You feel better. But it's like you, you everyone should fucking know like what is like really dangerous for you.


Yep. True. Remember in the nineties And what studies have you done and how honest are you being? And are you just trying to make more money? Yeah. In the nineties they took all the talent off the shelf. Remember that one kid died. This Jane, I just type in liver and covid and just seeing what Was coming. Oh no, this was about Tylenol. She died Ty of Tylenol failure. Ooh, these on Tylenol. What a fucking they might be. It says the covid is hard on your liver, So Oh yeah. I'm sure heads up already. Covid iss hard on everything. Yeah. But but, but the thing is like people have died from Tylenol without covid. Covid does suck. Tylenol, acetaminophen Google how many deaths of acetaminophen every year? 'cause that's an interesting Statistic. That's interesting. Google that every year. Yeah. Good for you. That's gonna be a tough spell Deaths Per year. Got it. That's an autofill. That's an autofill for sure.


That's about speed. Look at that. 4 58. It's not that much. 4 58 deaths every year due to acute liver failure. Whoa. Look, that's 4 58 people that didn't have to die. Yeah. Yeah. Gaza. Well, Yeah, pretty Low. I mean Time. It was time. Like if you die from But that's fucking, And look at all The hospital visits. Look at all the people that like had to be hospitalized. Go back to that. Please. Look at this. 2,600 hospitalizations. 56,000 emergency room visits. So it's not just the 4 58 people that died. It's 56,000 people that probably got on death's door. Hope it was the point where they had to go to the fucking emergency room Because it didn't cause in 2,600 Poison control centers.


Yeah. It's it's real. A lot of people like gonna the emergency room too. That's true. That's true. That is true. Emergency room that, I mean, look up how many, how many weed emergency rooms there are where people go. I ate all the popcorn. Oh my God. I had a friend of mine and I think it was like his sister's husband was a, a complete hypochondriac. Like a full on like he would go to, he'd go to the hospital like emergency room. Like all the time. Yeah. All the time. And she was going crazy. Like she didn't know what to do about it. He was like completely nuts. Like he would just get checked into the hospital And it was nothing wrong with him. And then he would just decide that there was something wrong with him. He had to go right now and he'd go And there was nothing wrong with him. And it was like a regular thing.


Jesus Christ. Yeah. But that's a stat that's in the steps. And he was Like her husband and they had children together and you got this guy who's just like the doctors, You know, who just can't stop going to the doctor. Like, he was like really kooky. It became like a real phobia, like a, like a real mental, You know, pathology. Oh, the doctor sucks. Guy embarrassed. I'm constantly thinking something was going wrong. So it was just like in this constant state of anxiety about his health. Yikes. It's A real thing that happens. Embarrassed got high with popcorn weed like edibles. Oh. And then ate the rest of the bag. Oh. And then went to sleep and woke up and was like, what the fuck? Something's wrong with me. Went to the hospital and the doctor tested him and he goes, smoke weed. And don's like, no, fuck.


Fuck. And he realized that's what was wrong with him. He damn. He went too hard. He Thought he was having a panic attack. He Went too hard. Oh, I never go to the hospital. I gotta be shitting blood or Yeah. I've gotta literally be dying. I told this story a bunch of times about Ari, me and Ari were playing pool once and Ari was limping. I go, why are you limping?
