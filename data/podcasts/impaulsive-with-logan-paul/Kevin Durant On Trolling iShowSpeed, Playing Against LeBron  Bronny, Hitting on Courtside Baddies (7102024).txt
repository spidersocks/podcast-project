So To What I'm, I'm, I'm like speaking facts Because you be speaking all fast and then you say a bunch of bullshit. No, I'm saying for real. Like, 'cause the E quitter changes changes. The moon main, the moon has four phases. But the moon, what changes? The, what causes the solar eclipse is the phase three of the moon. So the phase three of the moon and the sun collided and it began. So it causes the whole, the whole North America equator then?

Are they bots? RKO, Bro. That's tough. Yeah. Are they fake? Where? Who are these people? 150 million people. Bro, that's A, I don't know bro. That's 5% I. don know of the population. I don't know. I can't explain that. He's That guy, right? Currently. He's That guy. Potentially. Potentially. Yeah. He really is. Wait, do you follow football? Also known in America as soccer Sometimes. Who would you say is the goat of football?


Renardo. Oh, Come on. See, he knows bro. He knows Bro. Not to keep breaking this back up, but before you got RKO by Randy Orton somehow managed to squeal out Ronaldo better? Yeah, I don't know it, it was just an Instinct what I Just said. Completely unrelated in Any way. I was just like, why? Like why? Well, it's his brand. It's, it's part of his Brand. don don't know. I just instinct. I. don, Your instinct was to scream back at Randy Orton. Ronaldo better. Why he's barking at you. What Drew you to Ronaldo? Huh? Why'd you, why you love Renardo so much? Because like, he inspired me to become great You know when I was around 16, 17 You know. So you met him, Huh? Yeah, I met him.


Oh, did see a video actually. Yeah. Yeah. So did 250 million other people, You while out. Did you like really fan out and like almost, Yeah. Was that real? Yeah, Bro. Like I, it was, it didn't seem real, like, it felt like it was like You know, like, I don't know. Were you, Were you nervous before you met him? What do you mean? Was I nervous before? Was Your heart, was your heart beating fast? Yeah, it was being dumb fast bro. I was like on three X adr. Like I didn't, like I said, I was probably one of my best. That that is the best moment of my life. That's what's crazy. And the second one is, that's crazy million subs. But that, yeah, that's the best moment of my life. That moment right there when I met Ronald up. Do you have anybody in your life that would have that type of impact or had that type of impact that when you met him you had that, that moment? Me, When he met me, he was like, Nah man, hell nah.


Nah, Nobody, I respect people. Yeah. But not to, not like fanned out like that. Right. You always been like that? Yeah. Yeah. I guess So. Some people just don't get starstruck. I don't, I wouldn't. I'm like excited to see some of these people You. know what I'm saying? Saying 'cause you respect them. Yeah, because I respect them. Yeah. I see. They work and shit, but it don't go past that. What about, what about, what about girls? Like, come on there, there had to have been a girl that you thought was like bad as hell. Like a Rihanna who shows up and you're like kind of stuttering a little Bit. Nah, hell no. Nothing. Huh? Smooth. Nah. If anything, if I know I'm nervous around some, a girl or something, I just stay quiet until I gather my words bro.


don don't try to do too much Sharp. Yeah. Yeah. Mysterious say less. Yeah. Yeah. Type of Stuff. Less is more. Do you, are you following Cole and Kendrick stuff? Yeah. What do you think about all that's transpired? What do you think about Cole having a little like reverse moment after dropping the seven minute drill? Yeah. I didn't, yeah, I didn't think that would happen. Him rolling back on it. Yeah. I thought he was, I thought he was, stand on what he said. Business And they have a little sparing session, which what it is. don don't think it's anything bigger than just like, I'm a better rapper than you. Like it's not nothing personal. I don't feel like, so I didn't think it needed to go that far.


Do you think like, 'cause 'cause Jay, 'cause Cole is like, he, he does like a lot of community stuff. Like he's kind of off the grid, like You know, focused on like family and just building and stuff. They, they All three are. Nah, but I, I just mean like, do you think he had a, a, a quick relapse and got brought back to that type of You know hip hop beef drama moment and then just had a realization like, yo, I don't want to be here anymore. Maybe, maybe, maybe it was, maybe it was a lot, a lot of noise around You know that little, I guess that beef and they all friends, they all know each other. So I'm sure it was a little weird. But to, as a fan of the rap of the rap game, I didn't think it was too crazy with what was going on. I just thought it was just three great artists trying to state their claim as the best.


Did it hurt you to see that? To, to see him apologize? I wouldn't say it hurt me. No. Not sorry. Not hurt. Like, sorry. As a, it was surprising as a hip hop. As a hip hop fan. As a, as a, yeah, like going back to, to Ether and, and, and even back to Pocket. It Was surprising. 'cause I haven't, I didn't, I haven't seen that before in those situations. Right. But Cole's just, he's untouchable as far as like talent. Talent, Lyrical Talent, like everything he does, like, so What do you think Drake's gonna do? Don? Don't know. You never know what he does bro. He's just one of those stealth, like under the radar dudes that just pop up out of nowhere and just Some crazy shit. Yeah. The other, he also just let some shit ride for five or six years before he say something.


You never know with him. He Don't really have to respond either too. 'cause he's, do you think he's like kind of currently solidified as like numbers wise, scoreboard wise as like the go of of the space? Yeah. Yeah. But I also feel like he's competitive too. And he likes that little, he like, he likes to rap. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? And he likes to, he likes that little, that lyrical sparring session regardless of who it is over his whole career. You've seen it. So you never know what he gonna do with it. Man. That's the, that's the beauty of it though. 'cause you never knew what Kendrick was gonna do when he popped out like that when Cold came outta nowhere and dropped a fucking album in the middle of the night. Like these dudes unpredictable. That's the crazy part about it.


I feel though for Drake, it's gotta be worth his time and energy. Like he understands how precious that Is. Oh, This, this is You know because this Is it. Well I'm not saying that it's a moment. I'm not saying this was not right, but, but like I don't, I don't, I don't actually think Drake would get into like a sparring session. I think he would go to like a fight with 10 ounce gloves on to, to kill. So No. I mean, you gonna try to whip somebody ass in a sparing session too. But after it's not a real fight at the end of the day, you gonna go home and you still know this dude. Like after it's over Is it like, but, But like, okay. Who knows what could come from that. You also, you also spar dudes and they end up fucking fighting them next month. Who knows? Well, Drake. Drake trains like Drake trains with Heno, right?


Or was training with Heno? You talking about Actually sparring? No, bro, I'm talking about No, But you were talking about No I Wasn't. Were Talking about like lyrically spa lyric Sparring. Yeah. Like when Drake had that thing with, are you talking About gloves and all that shit? No, That's analogy. Well what's analogy? What's the analogy? What's, do we need Speed to explain to you what that analogy was? What's going Don Don't worry about it. No, no, no. When Ounce gloves had to do With the, when Drake had his thing with Pusha T. Yeah, I remember. Like we were all waiting for the response and then his final decision was no response. Which was by the way, the right decision not worth the time or energy. Look where they ended up like Right. One of one decision puts the guy on the map for a while. Who? Pusha T No, I think, I think if Drake had responded and, and done a proper disc track now it's like a thing by not responding.


That to me is like a power move. I just think he was, I mean he had dropped the album right after that too, so I'm sure it was a lot of lines in there directed Drake. Drake dropped a lot of, Yeah, there was, there were there Was he Drake's, he drops a lot of Subliminals too that are like known. He says what he, he says he speaks his mind every time he drop music and he drop music fucking two, three times a year sometimes. Yeah. Yeah. So it's like, even if it's not a direct response and a disc record or anything like that, he gonna tell you how he feel whenever he drops. Yeah, It's true. That's true. Are you tight with these guys? Yeah. Yeah, I know these guys. Do you ever kick it though? I feel like personally I'm bad at hanging out. No, I kick it, I kick it. I kick kick it when I can. You do? Yeah.


Would you want a two man with me? What does that mean? Like a two man? Oh, I wouldn not, I would not bring any women around you. What? Nah, I'm good with women. I know they like I, Got good rib bro. And they, they fresh. I never met 'em before and they first entry point to me is with you I, Got ribs, bro. Trust me. Me not Rocking. Could you see him at Hyde? Hyde? Hell no. Hy, where is that?
