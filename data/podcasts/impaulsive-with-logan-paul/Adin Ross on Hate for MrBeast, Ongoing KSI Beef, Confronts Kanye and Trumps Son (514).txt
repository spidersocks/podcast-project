Yeah, I love you too. Adin. I'm, I'm sorry you had to deal with Mike all these years. I I have as I have as well. Too many. You understand, right? Yeah. Of both, Both of you. Both of you. I'm probably the reason you both are alive still. You would not actually, you would, you would have, your brain would be dead, but you would actually be dead. You would physically be deceased. Yeah. Okay. If, if we didn't hook you up with top, You know, Mike, I'll give you that. Where the fuck is top dude, look at sitting on a call. I do wanna talk about that for a second. Business in social media. Okay. Okay. I, when, when we first started working together, I was always blown away by the fact that there was no like, massive business arm behind the company. There was Jeff and there were other people who tried to come in, but it was such a new and, and, and quickly building place where there was so much money, but no one knew how to wrangle it.


Yeah. The fact that that's still the case. Like I look at you, bro, you could, you could have already been worth a billion dollars. But the cool thing is this, I think one day, I don't want to be a billionaire. I think being a billionaire is a, is a bad, it comes with a bad image. I don't, I don't, I don't think that, and I'm not trying to, Oh, grove type shit. No, not that. I just think that like, name one billionaire. Ah, actually I don't wanna even, I don just, I don't know man. I think like, I need a hundred million. I'm good. My money Mel problems, hundred mil. I'm good. My money mill problems. Yeah, great. But bro, you go back like two, three years, bro. You were a fucking rocket ship. You still are, but you were a rocket ship. And if properly wrangled at that time, bro, you, you would, you would, you would have Mike. I think lot.


I think you're under underestimating how hard that is to, to build business. I think it's not good. No, it's, it's, it's, it's tough. I just, and I think you did, I think you fared really well, right? I think I've done pretty well, guys. Look, check it out. I own equity of where I stream. I own equity of brand risk, which yeah. Nobody has equity in my space for where they stream, right? Yeah. I have equity of that. I, I, I have ownership of a lot of things. I think I'm doing pretty good. You're doing great. That's not what I mean. That's not what I mean, was That, was that kick deal really worth a hundred Mil? No, it's an equity based deal. But Now I get paid off based off partner income, which is a great program by the way. You know, you can stream on Kick. Yeah. You doesn't matter how many viewers you get, you automatically will get valued and you get a hourly rate. You can average a hundred viewers and you'll get paid X mile per hour.


Why'd What? Why'd you point at me for a hundred? I didn't feel like that. My bad bro. My bad man. But Kick, kick is eventually gonna be number one. I mean, it's inevitable, right? Like a big, a big streamer. Someone that I've always looked up to. His name is Solo Ti he just started streaming. They just ban him on Twitch for just speaking his freedom of mine. Right? Kick has changed. That Kick has changed that. I think when Twitch takes away, like their Amazon Prime, their Twitch Prime, for example, I think Kick will automatically just take over organically without even signing big deals. Once, once Twitch takes away Amazon Prime subscription, which is a free subscription basically you got per month for based off with Amazon Prime. I mean, dude, the sub the sub drop is gonna be 80% down from Twitch. I mean, think about it. They're Pretty strict as well, right?


They're pretty strict. Are they? Would you say Twitch is soft? I just think it's PG 13. That's how you I would say it. Pg slash pg 13. Okay. But You're, you're be, when can you start? Are you gonna stream on, are we, we're not talking about this. You Could ask me whatever you Want. Are you gonna stream on Twitch again? Now? Look, I, I came for your comeback stream. Yeah, You did. It was on Kick and it Was on Kick. Your Twitch comeback stream was on Kick. Streaming Has changed. Mike Streaming has changed. Live viewer, live viewership. Doesn't matter. It matters about Clips now. So if I could stream from Buttfuck, whatever my clips, you'll see 'em. Yeah. It doesn't matter where I stream at anymore. It matters about, if you see me anymore, if relevancy, I did 480 million in views and clips. What? Across shorts, wherever, across all social media platforms, TikTok, shorts, et cetera.


I pay my Clippers. So, You know, we did almost 500 million views and I'm streaming on Kick. So it works. I just think that clips we're in a new age of streaming. New age of, of, of just internet in general. It's all clips. I mean, when I see you, I see you all over Clipse. You know, I, people nowadays, they just wanna watch 15, 20 seconds and just scroll. Yeah. Isn't That kind? Isn't that kind of weird? Isn't that kind of scary? It's killing attention span. I mean, fuck, I'm a TikTok kid. Scroll in 20 seconds. You know about what happened to like, it's crazy. Yeah. Just scroll. Yeah. Yeah. You don't even know I don No, I wanna ask you that question. 'cause you've been in the game. Well, vine. Vine really is TikTok. Yeah. You know, people, if you don't know what Vine is, I mean, Logan is the god of Vine. Right? I, it's just like Vine is really that Logan.


So I want to ask you that question. Why are you wearing black for you wearing Black Air Force? He, I don Know. Stylist tells me to wear, I put it on. You have a stylist of I don what I'm doing. I'm like a dumb ass from Ohio. I get it. I get it. Random. I'm colorblind. Like MrBeast Clear cleaned out people's visions. Is that what he, is that what you call, is that what you call that? Wait, did he Doubt their No. Un unblinded to somebody. He he unblinded them. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's doing God's work, dude. Why, why do people not like MrBeast? They think he's too corporate. They think that he's not, You know, like how Steve will do it if Steve will do it. He, he has the DJ and stuff. He's still deje. He's the degenerate because he's real. Like, people wanna see him more of a real side for MrBeast. I actually, I think he's a good guy and I think I respect the fuck out of Jimmy a lot.


I think he's very smart and I think he knows exactly what he's doing. And then I think recently he commented on the, the hunter Gorilla, or sorry, the hunter members. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then everyone was like, oh wow, Jimmy did this, Jimmy that. But dude, it's just bullshit. Yeah. You Know, wants Jimmy. Jimmy's Jimmy's such a good guy. Yeah. I mean, because it it Is, it is like a beast in a, in a satirical world. Yeah. Like it's a, it's a beast esque challenge. I actually, I actually just sent him a Who would win you think? Who? Hunter man verse wonder. Oh, you wanna do it right now? Yeah. A hundred men. Me too. Thank You. Yeah. No scientist already commented on it. Oh really? Yeah. He said like, 30 dudes would, 30 men would die. Facts. And then it would be, and then it would be cooked for the girls Cooked.


It's a hundred is a lot, dude. Yeah. That's, that's a, that's a, that's a Lot. What do you think the strategy is, by the way? All man Charge at once? No, no, no. Blunt. Blunt force. Get their arms. Yeah. You'd have to, you'd have to have like two or three guys on each, on each appendage on each arm. Yeah. Legs, arms. And then, and they, I heard they could bench like thousands of pounds. Layout. We have four or 5,000 Wait, gorilla's bench press. Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy. They Could lift and they could do whatever They want. Just made of bananas. Yeah. Wait, no, you didn't answer my question. Well, I don't think you Asked it. Sorry. This is just, this is great. They're getting Soundtrack. Predict it. Predict it. Predict the question. There Was something about Vine. Something about Vine. You started with Vine. Yeah. And to me, like obviously the way the internet is now with Clipse and stuff, but you kind of started out with Vine, then YouTube, and then you segue and then you did music and then you like, I mean, Logan, like, my thing was Is it is just like when you started out, what is the difference now?


Yeah. 'cause I feel like you started with clips and now it's clips Again. Dude, such a great question. First off, you're right. Starting with short form content, like just like little pieces. Little clips of content. And now having it be cyclical. So we're back is really great for guys like me and Jake. 'cause we think in terms of like six to 15 seconds. Was That how long bond was six? Six and a half. Technically crazy, but yeah. Six seconds. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Six seconds. And, and so and so and so we think like that. And now seeing, You know, 10 years of content changing and now it seems to be what you do streaming, which is like kind of fascinating to me because you just said it, it doesn't matter essentially who's tuning into your stream or how many people are tuning into your stream.


It's still all about the clips. That's all about Yeah. 'cause people want watch it on their own time. Like how, how many people are tuning into your live stream? Like, we're gonna break a a, a Pokemon box after this. Yeah. Yeah. How many people are Tune in if I hype that up with you? Shit, I'm gonna say anywhere from 30 to 40 to 50 to 60 K maybe. Is that solid in, in streaming numbers? Yeah. It's a lot. And I would say me being on kick, that's a lot. You know, there's no really discoverability on kick right now. Yeah. It's really hard. What was your max that you had concurrent on Kick? Yeah. No, it's on Twitch. What was the max was me, me, you and Emily Willis. I have the rec, we have The record. We number two. Sorry. Number one's me Blue face. I was gonna say that. Yeah. What was, how many people Is It, for example, I stream me President Trump on Twitch. It would've probably done millions. Yeah.


You know, I did, I did it on Kick though. Yeah. So, but it, it was, it was, everyone was re streaming my stream. Yeah. On YouTube when someone had like 5K Hassan, and then they had like a hundred thousand something. Yeah. Like everyone, I had millions watching me live by based off re stream's, reactions, all that stuff for the Trump. If I, I was On, I Think yeah, go. If I was on Twitch, if I was on Twitch with Cardi, for example. Yeah. Probably a million. But, but that's the thing. It's like live viewers. Yeah. It's very important. It's very like, when I do brand risk, I'll have still 200,000 viewers. I mean, we had Dana and Hunter coming to my last one. Do you Do it here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. If you do it here in this way. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Who You gotta come. That sounds fucking crazy, bro.


Dana was at, at the last one. Is it ticket a lot of people? Is It ticketed? No. Who, Who's, who's the audience Creators? Just, yeah, whoever. Streamers and YouTubers. Dana and Hunter came. Yeah. Were they scouting talent? Nah, they weren't scouting. What's it like running a boxing promotion? That is, that is a wild industry to dive into. So, so, You know, it, it is kind of wild. It is kind of crazy. I don't do any of the contracts and the money stuff at all. I, I like to leave out it. I just like to understand who's fighting and help make the cards, You know, and just be a part of it and just restream it. And just stream it. But dude, it's sick. I love it. I I really do. It's really awesome. I think that one day this thing could maybe take off and do some crazy stuff. I think we're making a lot of noise. Is that What you're, is that what you're trying to do?


Because, because a lot have tried and a lot have a lot have failed. Yeah, Bro. I, You know, I I I just think that every single one we've done, we've always kind of like done better than the other one. We keep improving. Yeah. So I, I'm just doing it for fun.

I'm twice as productive. I'm three times as driven. Who the Fuck made these numbers up? And I'm three times as three? Who made these numbers up? Me? Where were the metrics? Nah, Me. No, me. Because I noticed my, my mind like, light up. You have, but how'd you get two and three X off that? Based on my productivity while I was smoking weed and while I was not smoking weed. Like, like, whereas before, You know, six, 7:00 PM rolls around, you want light up a joint, you get lazy.

But They're stupid though. It don't make sense. I mean, I see how you're looking around. I'll, I'll Kendrick the Kendrick Drake beef is, it's, it's not beef when it's one sided beef. And what I mean by that is, I mean, bro, if you're lying, like, okay, so let's say we're beefing on the internet and I'm the first one to call you out for being a and there's no information or evidence to back that at all.


And let's just say this, you fuck the baddest bitches like I'm talking about you could fuck whoever you want and I'm calling you a and I make the hit song about it. That's all. Like, come on bro. It's all lies to me. Where about what about the other kid that Kendrick said you had? He said you you have a deadbeat to a daughter. Yeah. Where's the girl? Yeah, he's wrong. Why is nobody talk about it? Nobody's talking about the the lies he told. So he was just, he was just saying shit. He was rap beef back in the day. Look at hit him up. Look at Tupac and Biggie. That was girl rap. Real. Yeah. Yeah. And they were telling real stories about it. Well, fuck you bitch. You fuck yeah Bro. Yeah. But is this not just a representation of where society has gone? The reason what I'm, why, the reason why the Drake beef happened is because Drake ended up fucking all these people that are beef with him as girlfriends or girls, not girlfriend. I don, they were, Nah, no, that's not why, bro.


It was all the girls K do Kdot. Kdot took a very relaxed sub shot. Kendrick Careers got no, but Kendrick, but then Drake. But then Drake fired back, bro, bro, Ken Kendrick and made it, and, and Kendrick said like, yo, let's not do this. All right, let's Do this. Did that not happen? All that Happen? Ill, I'll give you a hundred thousand dollars. You could do what I'm about to ask you. Can you name me three songs off Kendrick's album before GNX? The Mr. Morale You can't do it. And The High Steppers. Big Steppers. Is that what it was called? What was the album called? I don't even know what that Mr. Morale, the Big Steppers. I don't know what that I'm not a single song. Thank you. The only I'm telling you I'm with you. So he needed No, the only album I fuck, the only album I fuck with is Good Kid, good Kid is an Incre course and, and Section 80. And You notice how they, he didn't win albums for those. Sorry. He didn't win Grammys for those. His best work.


He didn't win Grammys. So that's Just Well, because, because Adin do You know what's gonna be said by someone? What? Those, those albums aren't for us. What do you mean? Those are great albums though. No, but they're not. For us, Dan was an amazing album. But Up to Pimp a Butterfly they'll say is not for you. Do You know what I mean by that? I know exactly what you're trying to say, but that's What we'll be say. But that's letting you get to Their head. I don't wanna listen to that shit. Listen bro, I don't wanna listen to that shit. But Here's the way I could just say this, wait a couple years, wait to see what Kendrick puts out. Way to see what Drake Puts out. So you're saying it like this. Let's see who's still around a decade from Now. I mean, dude, we all know who the better artist is. I mean, come on, let's be real here. The Drake Lyric. See, see who's still around a decade from Now? I mean, dude, Drake is just a better artist. I, I can give you bad Kendrick albums.


You can't gimme one bad Drake album, by the way. You know, you wanna let me, lemme just tell you something that you would understand if 15 years ago, all these guys, Kendrick, asap Rocky, they're all saying about much of a goat, Drake, is, he took me on my first tour, he did this for me. Drake's the Goat. He shows the most love. How come now they don't fuck with him. It's all about jealousy and, and Amma animosity. Thank you. That's All. It's, you're actually right. He really, he really does not have a bad out. I Know him and Kanye have the best, Well, Kanye hasn't put up, Kanye hasn't put out a good album since Kanye. Yo Ceci has, Donda was amazing. Yes. Donda was a Great album, bro. I mean, I mean, here's the thing. Vultures one was great. Here's my question. Here's my question for you. When you, when you establish a level of success that Drake had with his, with, You know, if, if you're reading this and, and, and, and all of those albums now, the albums you put out, they can't have one or two good songs.


That becomes a bad album. You know what I'm saying? Like, like, like, same thing with, same thing with Kanye. You're gonna say, oh, you're gonna say Donda, or, or, or, or what songs did Donna have on it? He's done Miracles on. You can't even name the song. Yes, I can, But You know what I'm saying. Now you have, he got great, now you have to got Donna's got All Bro has crazy songs. Does jail on it. Jail's on it. Now You have to, now you have to name it off the Grid. We got crazy songs on there, bro. Adin, praise God. Yeah. You have a relationship with Kanye. Dude, we were, do we have dude, I was supposed to do like streams with him five different times, bro. Still to this day, you're trying to make it happen. I could've, I wanted to. I didn't go d Are you fucking with Kanye lately?


Yeah. I mean his, he's a musician at the end of the day and he's one of the goats. I always have love for him. And I think that his music's fucking amazing Genius. Yeah, but what about he's a genius. What about with the message? He's, he's talking about with Your people. He's just doing all this for social suicide because he can't see his kids. So like, he just genuinely doesn't care anymore. He is, everyone's back stabbed him. He feels like, like, fuck everyone. He's like basically like a stray do. But does that make it right? No, but I, I'm understanding how he's thinking. I don't think it's right, but that You don't understand how he thinks. I don't Trust me though. I'm trying to though. No, you can't. I'm trying to gimme the benefit of the doubt. You can't, You can't, you can't understand how, Okay, so, but, but defend by the way, at all. No, I, I hear Well, you're Jewish dude. There you go. I'll be the last one I found out You're Jewish too, by The way. 7% brother. I'm in. Yeah. Okay. What?


No, I was just wondering. I mean, it's cra it's, it's crazy. He's super disrespectful and Yeah. Yeah, man. I think he like crossed the line like way too many times. But we Said that back in 2022 with the Hitler Was right. Ho homie no one, no. Here's the problem with this conversation right now. No one, no one cares about this anymore. Yeah. I think he fuck no gives no one gives us fuck I a fuck about Kanye anymore, anymore. No, he's, he's, he's, I agree. He, he has entered the realm of r Kelly. I love remix. I re I love Remix to Ignition. I'll listen to that shit right now. It's the remix to Ignition. But dude, he was pissing on people, You know what I'm saying? And, and now Kanye, I think when Gay came at Virgil, that's when the bro, come on. Are you serious? That's the rap game was like, No, that's not Alright. Alright. I was just, I was just wondering 'cause I know, I know you guys, You know, Virgil has done so much, bro.


Come on bro. Yeah, that's tough. Yeah. That's, that's Tough. But that's not it. That's one of a thousand things. A thousand Things. That's what I'm saying. So he's crossed the point of no return. I Just think the issue is that like, You know, when he went on the, the Jesus king run when he made the album, like you talk about love, dude, like you're, the problem is it's gonna affect his kids' lives. That's the problem. Whatever, it's, the damage he does now is it's gonna affect kids. That's tough. I feel bad for Kim dude. Yeah. I mean, dude, she, she seems like a really good mom, bro. Yeah. She takes her kids to soccer games. She does a lot for Children, bro. Yeah, she cares. She really care. She cares, bro. So, I mean, even with the Prime thing, I don't know too much about it, but you could tell she's a good mom. She wants what's best for her kids. So it's like, I, I don't know, bro. I I, I do feel bad, bro. I pray that, You know, the, the, the, I pray for the kids. I pray for the family. I hope everyone's good. No, and For, and for and for.


Yeah. Yeah. No, for real bro. He, he, he, he's obviously a, like a disturbed genius. He created incredible art. Smart. He's incredible. He's in created incredible fashion. But he's lost, bro. And, and honestly, like, I don't really know what thing it was, but he really never was the same after his mom passed. Like, truthfully, like, that was like, kind of like the mark point where he started to, Have you guys ever met with him or talked to him? No. No. But obviously Keah is super close with him and Yeah. You know, he's, he's in the circles and he is around, but he's always been, I don't know, it just seems like all the rumors that were ever said ended up being completely true. Be True. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Scary shit. Yeah. Scary shit. But I will say this though, you gotta pray at the end of the day for him. I hope he makes hope.


He can find peace and happiness and you're praying for him. Yeah. Just Act active prayer. Just in general. Lately since I've been going to bed, I, I've been very grateful for my life and like, what I've had, what I've created for myself. I don't know what it is lately, bro. I've just been like, close my eyes and I just think to myself, thank God for this, that appreciate this. That cool lately, bro. I don't know what it is. It's just been like, I've been doing it every night top. No, absolutely not. You know how much I do You know how this kid devotes his entire life to you? Yes. Well, Tov does an amazing Job to, to a couple people. But, but he, I see what you're doing there. But He loves bro, he loves you dude top. He, he every day, bro. Yeah, Dude, top I'll, I'll do you understand?


I'll be at dinners with him. I'll be at some of the cool, we do the coolest shit in the fucking world. Yeah. Where at this thing, that thing, he never gets off his phone. He's always texting you or somebody from your team. 24 7. No TA is on it, man. That's that's what I'm saying. That's why one day him and I are gonna get rich. It's, and, and that's inevitable. What's The plan? You gotta you gotta build brands. I feel like, I mean, brand risk. We, I think, Hey bro, one day We can make this thing go crazy, but if not, we gotta, we will come up with some more shit. Maybe some other brands. I Got some Stuff for you. You should Really gimme a prime deal. I don't want a lot of money. Yeah, but That's not gonna, that's not gonna make you Well if you, no, I don't want, I don't want it for the money. I just wanna put it on my brand risk. I need something there, You know? Would Jake be upset with that or no? By the way, Jake and Ks I fight.


You're the one that make it happen, by the way. I, I tried Adin. I, dude, I gave it 110% effort. Be honest, who's the one that's not making it happen? Mm. I think Jake wants it in case I say he's retiring. Mm. I Don't want, who's not making it happen? Okay. So the, in my very, very hard attempt to try to make it happen, it has come down to a weight disagreement. Really? Yes. That's so whack. Wait, What's Ks i's normal weight, What's case Ks I will, will go up to 190. Jake will go down to 1 92 and a half. There's no weight to two bad if this Yes, it is two and a half. No Difference. No. Well, that's what they's saying. That's right. Could you imagine Mike Tyson's saying like, nah man, I'm not gonna go down the two pounds.


He's a heavyweight fighter and you've never cut weight. And dude, I'm telling you when you cut Yeah. Logan would know When you cut Weight, it's different. It fucks up your performance. Damn. So for Jake, who's now, by the way, walking around at 2 25 Oh yeah, no, 30 pounds is like a huge deal. And opposite for KSI, who's walking around about 180, 180 5 come up. Sorry. What's The weight? What's the heavy weight skill? I think it's 2, 2 0 5. So 2 0 5. Okay. And Ks, his normal weight right now is one 90. He's probably, He's, he probably walk while he is training. Yeah, he's probably, he's probably 180 5. Okay. Which, which by the way, so he's now gaining weight, so he's gonna be slower and not as reactive. I get it. And then Jake's gonna be drained. It's, it's, I see both sides. It just, it feels super unfortunate. I don't know if it'll ever happen.


Yeah, I know, But I, I'm just like, trying to think of it from a more unbiased standpoint and like being outside of the game. It's just crazy. Like, one, one of the people would have to want it bad enough to like, to just, or or be confident Enough. It would have to be, it would have be their side dude. Because Jake's Jake's going. He's going Okay, but about about put I hear he's, dude, I'm hearing who Jake's like I knew I know about Yeah. The Shit, Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know obviously like I didn't tell anyone, but like, I knew about the shit, like what was happening. Yep. I knew about Canelo. Yeah. Am I allowed to say the other one or no? Yeah, you could say it. Yeah, I think, are you sure? Yeah. He said it once. Avante. Yeah. Yeah. He said it like, I Knew all about all that and I before, like, so I knew about that for a while. So my whole thing was, it was like, okay, like look at the route he's going.


I know. So it's like, Jake, why would he slow down? He's gonna do these crazy. He's not even a conversation. There's no point. Jake's got everything to lose, Bro. And he's making so much bread on these fights. There's no point. There's No point. He and he, by, by the way, he knows that he doesn't care. And, and That's what I'm saying. But he's still, bro, I'll text Jake, like, I'll text him sometimes and like, I'll send him like a, like a clip or something like, or whatever. And Jake's like, man, like, I'm not gonna say too much, but like, you know, Jake will be like, damn bro, like this, that, this. So Jake, I mean, I know Jake, bro. He's a great fighter. I mean, Dude, You know what, You know what else I even tried to do? To, to, to get them to, to agree. Yeah. In the same way that KSI and I fought and then went from rivals to friends to business partners. Does Jake Wanna do it?


No. No. It just, like, I, I thought, I think there's something there. You Know what beef I wanna clear up with Jake. Jake and Dana. Dude, they're two really good People. Oh my God. I hate Logan. Hate that dude. I hate it too. Hate So there's such good guys, Jake and I fucking hate that. Dana's a really good Person. I know, dude. I know. Dana's awesome. He's always been so good to me. I fucking love him. And then How do we clear that there needs to be a way Ah, That's gotta be a way, man. Because might a because you know, it's because, You know, it's, it's like, it's It's not too far, Too far. It's bigger than that as well. You think so? It's bigger than that. Yeah. See, you Probably know way more too. Yeah. It's, Dana's just such a good person. There's a lot of, there's a lot of on wiring to redo to, to, to like reverse. You know what makes it so fucking hard for me, bro.


Isn't just Dana in Ks I though, right? Yeah. But I, I love Dana. I always have my whole life. And the UFC, bro. It's, it's a once dude sport. I watch, I love ufc. It's fucking sport. I watch. Who do you Got to pour an Islam fight? I cannot fucking wait for that. Oh my God. Oh my God. I'm Asking another one after, bro. Probably jab Tab. Me too. Yeah. What about Aspen Jones? You guys gotta get Jon Jones on. Oh my God. We, we, we, we got, we had Aspenal on. Yeah. Saw that. It's fantastic episode. Yeah. And Aspenal does not like me, bro. What? I blew him off. I fucked up my wife. What? What did you do? I blew him off for Jon Jones. 'cause I was supposed to do a stream of Aspenal in New York, but Jon Jones was fighting, so I was like, fuck, I'm gonna do John Jones. I wrote him paragraphs apologizing. That's Like the one person you couldn't have fucked him over phone.


I, Bro. No, I feel bad. Hey, I'll be honest with you, he's a good guy. He, I don't think he probably really cares. He left me on red like three times and he responded me it maybe he's busy. Okay. Just give it some time. You think guy fight's gonna happen? Yeah, I do. Who Do you think he's gonna win? Gotta go with my boy John. Dude. Yeah. I, I told, I told Aspenal I'm a, I'm a John fan. Yeah. I'm a John fan. Yeah. He's a different breed dude. You've gotta go with John. He's a different breed He didn't lock in versus the training for steep A So I feel like when John is training for John Aspenal, he's gonna lock in and train like no other. He Will. Yeah, he Will. He's and John could take a hit, bro. He's A beast. He's the goat. He's the goat. UFC fighter. Like actually yeah, I think so too. Who, who Else Could be? But I, I don't. No way. No way. I I Don't think so either. No, don't think so. George Sha maybe Por dude Is awesome.


C we'll see Too. Por is really good. He's very good. I don't think anyone could beat him in his, in his weight class. No. That guy could throw. Yeah. I love the use. Yeah. We, we, I would love to try to fix that. Did you watch the Diego Lopez fight versus Volke? I did. Oh God. Dude. Volke is a fucking gangster, but He got saved by the bell. I think it was round two. Round three. Yeah. Diego doesn't get knocked down though, man. No, He's tough. He's got Chase Steel. He's tough, Bro. But yo, that's the fight game. And, and that particular fight for vol was so big because due to to be on top for as long as he was, get derailed, lose a couple fights in a row, get like knocked out, knocked, knocked out, and then to come back Yep. And become champion again.


Yeah. Dude, that adversity, he said it in his, in his, in his, in his post-fight speech. I think he said adversity is a privilege or something like that. And it's so true because if you can get knocked down and come back, those are the greatest fuck stories. Damn. Damn Bro. I wanna see Vol versus Topoya again. Probably never Happens. Tough. I mean, tough. We'll see. We'll see. That's cool. You like UFCI love UFC too. I love you. I know it makes it tough for you with the, the whole thing. Hopefully that goes Up. Just, it just sucks because I, I see the perspective of like, like I, I haven't always been the best big brother. That's a, that's a non-starter. But it, it, it's tough when I genuinely love people that my brother has severed his relationship with. I understand. And, And, and it's like, Were, so I Got asked you this question for your wedding.


Are you inviting KSI? I did. Oh shit. I did. Well, I didn't think about that. I did. I thought about it. I did. And, and he told me, he said, he just man to man. He was like, Hey man, I I don't think I'm gonna be able to come to your wedding because of Jake. Damn. I said, I said I totally get that. But like, just so You know, we were on a bus with Conor McGregor who I saw that. Yeah. And you guys were all talking and then it was chill. It was, or now it wasn't. It was simmering the entire time. We, we both said that if, if one person made one comment that was over the line, he would've Thrown, Either of us would got it. Like he and, and he's con McGregor, but there's two of us win. I was supposed be there that day on that bus. I had a really bad No way. It Was good to be with you guys 'cause it was fun. You, you guys been with Alex, right? Yes, I was there, but I, I, I didn't go, man.


I Got invited to the action inauguration too. There's like a couple hundred people in that room. I was gonna be in that room. You know, I'm, I'm cool. Baron a lot. Baron's a really cool guy too. You're a Cool Barron Trump dude. He's the coolest guy. We wanna have Him on the show. He'll, he'll, I think he'll eventually do it. I just spoke with Baron today. I can't, I'm not gonna talk about what he speak about. Dude's a really good guy. They're Like homies. I'm not gonna speak. I don't even know that. I don't wanna leak anything. I, I think he's genuinely a brilliant and an amazing heart, great soul. Whoa. Baron is awesome. He's a legend. He's an amazing human being. That's awesome. And so tall. Very tall. So tall. Every time I see him, like, dude, you grew. I just saw him recently, dude. He grow. Like, dude, that guy's huge bro. Dude, He's an enigma. That's why people love him. They're not really sure what he's up to, what he's about.


Yeah. Yeah. But, but they know. He's, he's up, he's up to something and he knows shit. He's smart. He's very smart. Very, very smart. Is It, Is it, is he part of the reason that Trump did your stream? Yeah. So Baron, You know, when I went to, I, I believe Trump had a rally here in Doral. I went there. I, I've met Trump before, but I, it was the first time Baron went to any of Trump's rallies. Baron was there. He is like, dad, this is who I was telling you to do the stream with Adin. I was like, oh. He's like, I'll do it, I'll do it. Like, Yeah, yeah, Yeah. Don't do it. Yeah. And Baron advised him and hit up Trump's team to make sure that I was taken care of. And we did this the right way. Dude. Baron looked out like, like, yeah. Whoa, Baron honestly put his dad brain to do the, the Vs. And Oh God.


I think maybe, Oh God, how did you guys do it? Maybe even Baron put the good word for you Guys. I think he did. I think he said it. He's very Smart. I I think he men Trump, Donald Trump Well mentioned it to you guys that like Baron was like telling him to do certain shows. I think we may have been on the list. Well, What was part of Jack Theo? J Yeah, J Jack was a big part of it as well. He probably asked Jack probably, I could see him bear like, Hey, do you think these guys maybe we, But You know, 'cause I I will say this though, obviously Dana also helped as well. So was Dana. Yeah, for Sure. But you know how like, at that time it was just weird. 'cause after the whole thing with the assassination attempt. Yeah. I was the first one to do the first interview with him after the attempt. Yo. Yeah. That's crazy. And I did it live. Nobody was doing, Did, did he have the bandage on his ear? He didn't want to.


I I, I didn't see it. But he didn't want to, he didn't wanna have a certain size. That was actually the, that was actually the crazy, that stream was the crazy, like Todd and Kea just kicking in the audience. Yeah. Kea was in the Audience wearing, wearing the ass. So funny, man. And then XC was wearing like a Trump with Or gold hot girls. We tried, bro. We tried, we tried to have the the competition on too. We, we like had Did you Try Kamala? Yeah, we had been first to see it, dude. I really did. We Were in conversation. We were in conversations with, with their team on having both of the guests on. 'cause You know, we're, we're not a super political, like, get podcast. I Get it. You should do both sides. No, we Want Joe Rogan too. Joe Rogan did too. She did the same thing to Joe too. We tried very hard. Oh, She said, you guys gotta come to me. No, It was, it was just like, she couldn't make it work with the schedule or X, Y and Z and, and oh, and then I think what it was was then once we had Trump on, they were like, we're not gonna do it because we don't wanna make it look like we're just doing it.


Be as a, as a follow up to Trump. Hmm. Turned out to be just such an error. Not, not, not stupid. Stupid. Not doing the PO down. So that's, by the way, just so You know, that is the reason, at least one of the big reasons why she lost. She didn't, she didn't apply. So let's ask you that question. So do you guys generally think that your podcast, my thing I did. Do you think percent? A hundred percent. A hundred Percent. Yeah. Because it gives people, it gives people behind the scenes look at who the, who the candidates are when they're not hitting talking points, Bro. I think, I think the podcast circuit that Donald Trump did undeniably affected the, I know you asked Trump about the Election. That's why I love live, bro. You just, you're live. That's why I Got to ask the Young Thug thing. Did they give you any parameters on stuff? Not to say, Not really. A little bit, but not think crazy.


He probably got the same couple that we did. Probably. It was, it was about the, a litigation that was like happening in real time. Oh, I Don't know about that. They, they, he brought up the assassination. Him. At first they were like, Hey, be careful. Yeah. He brought it up. He brought up Dude, if that, if that were me, I'd be that all, that's the only thing I would talk about. Yeah, bro. That's it. That is fucking insane. Crazy. What? Like, he's basically a ghost. Yeah.

And then posted it. And people really thought that I was texting Ryan. And they're mad at you? Yeah. Okay. Dude, look, Ryan, that was when I was like, bro, This is like Ryan. I'm not, Ryan wasn't really in the good head space. He's in a great head space Now. I think if you guys had a off call, off-camera conversation, I think you guys Would go up. So back to the Kanye situation where it's like when, when something is just completely too far and you've crossed the line more than one time.


At what point Is it like lowkey unforgivable. I Understand that. Said, Well, you decided I'm trying to connect more with God. Got you. And, and learn from the teachings of Jesus. 'cause I think they're incredible. And I've, I've, I've, I'm like, I'm, I'm, my connection with God has, has gotten much stronger. Let's go Logan. I'm attempting, I'm attempting to forgive people in my life who wronged me because I think forgiveness is one of the hardest and most mature things that someone could do. Like, there's just such wisdom in it. It's, it's tough for me at the moment, given that Ryan went from disparaging and lying about my brand, my baby, a product that is genuinely a better for you hydration product in the market to then I get it to then like kids Gaza or more lies about like my personality, boian growth.


Like, man, I was like, enough is enough, man. Enough is enough. And so it's, I'm in a, I'm in a tough position. I'm trying. I'm trying. But, but, but, but how about this? People still gotta be held accountable, dude. People still gotta be held accountable. That's fair. You know what I'm saying? And that's fair. And, and then let's have that conversation. That's fair. You know, dude, You guys need to do impulsive with XUC. I know. I know, I know. But like another one, I wanna do more collaborative podcasts.

Watch him come out at a WWE event. Man. I swear to God, like it's aura. Something in the atmosphere changes the whole stadium is just watching this Guy who else, who else, who else? It was so crazy. It was so crazy.


I see this clip a lot about Jack on your guys' podcast was he seems so, so smart and like, Dude, man, What happened? I know what happened. And you know what, you know what? I, I've obviously fucked up a ton when I was young and I'm, I'm waiting for him to You have Yeah, yeah, Yeah. Miami trying. We can I ask it? Yo aid? Look at Yeah, look at that picture.

I'd like to, I'd like to, I'd like to be invited. Like maybe if I Got WWE does an event there.


So Cool. I feel like enough time has passed and obviously like, it's not my pussy even speak on it. But I feel like if you go back to Japan, bro, you do something so cool. And for the people and just for you. I think I, I love Japan. It'll go crazy. He goes there and fucks up again. That world So bad. Just so Bad. Like horribly something horrible happens. Yeah. And it's like, and he's like, okay, now I'm not going back. Oh, ever again. Yeah. No, I love it. I love it. You don't leave Miami, you don't go any, like, He doesn't leave the warehouse. Nah, I haven't traveled in a minute, bro. Why not? You know, I just went to Toronto recently. That's it. That's just such a weird place With Drake. Well, the Drake Street. Yeah. Yeah. That was a, that was a crazy stream Dude. It was a, it was a fun One. You guys had, you guys had a emo band Playing.


Yeah. It looked like you and you dressed up emo. Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, it did. You had a strong woman walking around, Dude. Yeah, I was cur I curled like a 50. What was, who was coming up with these ideas? Drake Smart bro. I'm telling you, if Drake was a shooter, he would shut it down easily. He could. Yeah. He's tuned in. Smart Bro. Shit was so funny. What About the, what about the, like, if You think about Drake is he's so tapped into everything. Yeah. Like it's not just Because he consumes, he consumes. It's Not just music. It's not just streaming. It's not just us. Like he's tapped in. Like he just knows. Like, but that's why he's number one. It's 'cause of that. Yeah. You know, he didn't, he almost didn't even make that trip. He almost didn't even make it up there, bro. It was by the D we, we had delay the stream. Yeah. All kinds of jet fucking issues and Hey, there's been a lot of crazy plane shit this week or this year too.


Yeah. Scary. Isn't it crazy? We're already almost halfway done with 20, 45 Shit's flying. Flying goes faster too. Adin does As you older. Yeah. It speeds up. So what, what should I do from now to 30? I'm 24. I would say. Do what you're already doing. Okay. In in terms of at night when you pray, just be grateful as fuck. That's just, thank God. Thank God bro. Thank God for the day. Lemme ask you this. If you had to give me one piece of advice Yeah. What would you like, what would you give me? 24 years old. I think you were 24 when you fought Floyd, right? Or 25? I Was 20. I think I was 26. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. You, you, you have plenty of time to do like your first like real big thing.


Okay. If I were you given the platform that you have and given the stigma around influencers that is disappearing in that Oh, he is just a streamer. He is just a YouTuber. Like when I was coming up, man, it was like we were up against a wall. Yeah. Because no one really took us seriously until they had to because the eyeballs were all focused on us. Given that's the direction I think influencer is heading. You should really take a deep look at where you can start to build meaningful, impactful brands. Got it. So just build brands right Now. I would, I would focus on one or two that are really important to you.


Brand risk is, it's awesome. What does the exit look like? I don't know. But but Yeah, I know it's, we, we, we talk about that. It's like, what does it look like? We're not doing ticket sales, we're not doing certain things, but, but then you look at like Turkey, he just put on a hold then at Times Square 300 people, no ticket sales. He spent 500 million probably on that thing. Yeah. But yeah. But he's got unlimited money. He's got unlimited Resource. That's the wrong way to look At it. Got it. You are in a position where you can, you can, you can with the right partner pretty easily. For real. Build a, build a real brand. Oh, Imagine like a, a brand, like something to help, like a pro a daily problem. Like people have bad breath, for example. You know what I'm saying? That's Goods. Good idea. Yeah, that'd be kind of cool. I mean, and you could help them. We all struggle with bad breath, right? Yeah. Not me.


I drink so much water and Prime. Yeah. But still, I'm sure something if you had like a cigar or something you needed like something, Or if you smoke weed, your breath gets stinky. Because if you did that, if you came up with a good consumer product there, you could have a big exit and like, I'm down, bro. I mean, let's, let's get together. You talk about it. So what what this exercise right now where you attack the category first is I think where you should start. Got it. So, so like look at a category for Example, did you, in case I know you were to do Prime or just came up? No, this company who was beverage masters had been reaching out to my manager Jeff, was That the name of the company? Beverage Masters? No, no. That should be a company Beverage masters. No. They, they wanted to make a drink with me. They wanted make a drink with me.


And I was like, man, that sounds in. Interesting. We vetted them. They were way overqualified. They convinced me to do a drink and we just had to come up with the name and the brand. And I was a little afraid to do it alone. 'cause like a Logan Paul drink, I don't know. But me and Case I had just reconciled and I was like, it was big dude. If we get him involved now, this brand has a story. It's a love story. It's about, it's about coming together from rivals to friends to partners genius. And it fucking worked. I'm doing right now, by the way. Excellent. Good. Excellent. It's genuinely the fastest growing hydration brand. Are You gonna sell it? Eventually? Not never. All of it. I fucking, I love, love it.


I love the brand. Cool. I I love it, man. It's, it's, it's like part of me. And, and you'll see, bro, once you build something that you feel like, bro, this brand's outgrown me. Like I, I go up to kids at the airport. I used to go up to, I'd see 'em drinking prime. I used to go up. I'd be like, Hey, how's that? How's that drink? And they'd be like, oh my God, Logan Paul. No way, dude. Now I do. And they look at me like, who the fuck are you? That's Dope. But that's how it should be. It's actually sick. That's fucking Yeah, it's sick. I'm like, how's the drink? They, and they just stare at me like, who's this fucking, who this guy. 30-year-old guy asking me about my prime. Yeah. And I'm like, bro, that's Been, that, that happened to me a couple times with the burgers I told you about too. Yeah. It's, it's a good thing. It's the thing it's ever happened. It's a dude at TSA in security. When he was doing my id, he was like, yo, you're the guy that has those burgers.


Right? I'm like, never seen the podcast book. YouTube, Adin, Ross Stream. Nothing. That's crazy. Just loves burgers. That's dope. Yeah. You got those great burgers, right? Yeah. That's awesome. That's all. That's that's awesome. That's no, that's the best outcome. So, so, so, so that, that would be my piece of advice. And then, and then my other piece of advice would be, try your best to keep good fucking people around you and vet your partners. Invent, Vet. Like make, make sure you make sure you're doing, make sure you're doing proper diligence. Checks on people that you're giving your time, energy, and ideas to. Got you. And money. Because I, I have found that in the brand building that I just suggested to you.


The successes and failures have both solely come at the cost of who I partner with. 'cause I will always fucking show up. Makes sense. I'll always do my job. I'll always tell my, do what I say I'm gonna do with my partners and I tell my partners to, to this day that I'm doing stuff with in the future. I'll do that. And then now we're doing diligence background. The One thing I've always had trouble with, Logan, maybe you could gimme advice. Like, I'll do really well for a long time and I'll be like, fuck. Like I'm, my life's too good. I kind of want to like Fuck it up. Feel Mischievous. Yeah. Just like, it's too perfect. What Do you do with what, what do you mean by this? Also Adin. I don't get lazy. One thing you have to understand, I was just gonna say one thing you don't understand about him. There's no one like him. There's not a single fucking person. Have you sucked his dick? That's not true.


No, no. This, I'm saying that's not true. One fucking thing You would've fucking shrimped. No, I'm just asking. You've been saying it to him the whole fucking time. Have you sucked it? No. You asked me. Sucked each other. Yeah, because you glazed. You glazed. No, I don't. I'm saying glazing. I'm saying one nice thing right now. You're glazing. I'm saying one nice thing right now. It's the only nice thing I'm, I'll say something mean too. Your heads look stupid. Look at, listen to me. He works harder than anybody. Not true. Not True. No. Stop. Let me finish my fucking sentence for the first time in my fucking life. Okay. He works so hard, bro. He, dude, I have partners that I brought him on on some shit recently and introduced him to some people recently that I was doing. And they're like, the other people involved in this product. I need to chase, I need to hunt. This dude calls them. Mm. He starts, he wakes up in the morning, he starts working.


He does not stop working until he goes to bed. Like he, he, you'll never understand a workout. Like, Aiden's not like that. Adin not like that. I'm not straight Up aid Adin. Hold on, hold on. I appreciate those kind words. No, and you all, and don't say you weren't always like that. 'cause you were, you al that was, that's Not what I'm gonna say. I think Jake works harder than me. Jake does work harder for real. I, I'm more, I'm More like you Adin. I'll have a good fucking run of being on my shit. I'm, I'm grinding and then I just wanna fucking chill. Chill. But chilling, chilling to him means he, for two hours at night, he has a drink. He still is gonna work 18 hours that day. What's Your go-to drink? Dude? I love this espresso martinis. When did you Switch? Wait, wait, switch Espresso. Martin, you were dirty. You.
