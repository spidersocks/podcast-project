That have upset me. Yeah to a point that I almost had a manic breakdown. And I have seen the breakdowns happening on social media over the past couple weeks. I, get It. Yeah. Some people have offended you with their snack. I'm offended Yeah by this snack. Yeah for Sure. But I have a little bit more of a reason to be because it's just not thing on this fucking table. like, like, like every day I come. It's like Wolf You know God No problem Drink No No do This way.

Let's get into which one first. Yeah. Let's do It maybe, or the Let's do It. Let It, No No. I mean. I mean we can, we I we can upsetting snacks. We can the upsetting snack I. Don't know. We can talk with lunch today. I just don't know. What. It is there What there is to say like, I made a video about It And I I I.


Just can't believe that we're in a place where people, people Are mad about a, a Turkey cheese And Cracker steak. Okay, who is Damn? DTM or Is? it. It's s Not even it's s not even So much. Damn. T-D-M-T-D-M. Who? Who is He? What is What is He. Michael I. Want to be careful with my answer? Got. It. Because I believe It could offend some Damn. TDM fans. And. Because my answer is I. Don't know. I don't either. And I don't mean that in even a slightly disrespectful way. don I. don trying don, it's like it's It I. think it's a representative. And indicative of how deep the U2 sphere goes. Deep That. Someone could come out And, make a statement. And, you're like, who's that guy? And? 40,000 of his fans. Or a hundred many hundreds Of thousands of millions. They're Hundreds of millions.


Millions. They're, they're just like Oh. He's the MrBeast from Belize So here. like, where, who is He from? Belize? Yeah. Who is, who is Damn? MD's. DMT. Here's What. I do know. DMT Damn. DMT is That. What. It is Yes. Yes He just has a drug channel. Yes. Where He smokes the toad all day. Yes What Does. He do. Yes Well He smokes the Toad. And He plays Minecraft. Oh He is a minecrafter to, is that What? He does Yes. He's a minecrafter. Is He as big or less big than the young kid? That We had on the time that one time. Jack Dougherty No. The the kid. That was the Minecrafter That we had on in England. But Yeah, Damn T DM is a apparently pretty big. He's Got a lot of, a lot of fans who like his Minecraft content.


And And hate You, Well, I, I I. Guess like know, you know, all We can do is is, is is. Hear him And. You Know hear What people. Are saying, And, we're a company. That listens to the consumer. And the feedback. And, We have We have some stuff in the pipeline. I think that's s going excite people, but Yeah man, I, I, I, I. think we're in a, a weird spot where tearing people down, And hatred, And negativity gets way more attention. Clicks, And views than the opposite. Which is a little sad. 'cause like in The world where YouTubers, Are trying to expand And build businesses. I, I do feel like there should be a, a level of support. like I. think YouTubers should be supporting YouTubers. And, And. I. Guess I. I. I.


I. Hear What. He's saying, but you know, We, we've made a, when compared to Lunchables a a better for You option, Well. And It would've been fine if It was launched by a, you know, normal people. But you guys, Are terrible people. You all, all three of You Are awful humans. What did JJ do What. JJs like the only one that's like semis safe, bro. Because We can I Love him. He's great. Yeah And, I love That. He just He just makes everything a joke. Yeah He turns everything into a I. I. And MrBeast too is also great. He's awesome, dude. It's really, it's kind of just you. It's just me too. Yeah. It's just totally, Which is crazy. Now 'cause like I, I don't t Know bro. I haven't really, like I haven't really been doing much.


Yeah. I'm just kind of hanging out. What. What have I Don. I'm just trying to build businesses. And raise a family. You made an offensive snacks, I'll tell you that much. Fiesta nachos. t Know. But that's offensive to Mexicans. Here's, it's there. Are. A lot of Offended Are. You offended by That. Yes. Extremely do It You should have called That. One Lunch. Leah lunch. Leah No, No No. Here's my rule. If you're going hate on this, try the product first. And, if you still hate It, do do your worst. But my, my, my issue is, if, if we were to make anything other than this, It would kind of be inauthentic. 'cause this is a meal. I grew up eating And still love to eat.


To this day, So I thought, why not just make our own version, but better than the existing current existing version in Lunchables? You. Wanna know What the crazy thing? I don that t Eat two A day. I've not tried It yet. You've not s not tried lunch. Please don't. Because And I don't think, do You wanna know my one issue with this product? Sure. And, I'll, I'm going be I'm going be kind of transparent, serious. Give It to me. You have this product, right? Prime Yeah drink those thing can sit in fricking Haiti for this product for a year. And a half Oh. You don't like refrigerated grill, bro. Why would You launch a perishable product? It, they sent three of themed to my house. Yep. You like, like Also saw You. Got. You Got robbed by a package, a door-to-door package. I did. He didn't steal the Lunchie. He did not. Probably because He was too warm. He stole my my donut shop coffee, which is my favorite thing.


36 count from Amazon, my 36 count of donut shop Coffee I have No coffee at my home, right? Now Donut Shop Coffee reached out. Shout out to Donut Cho co shop Coffee in their social media team. Who saw that I was robbed. And sent me a big supply. Let's s go. That was really cool. That, that's cool. And also vote. Nathan Hockman for DA of Los Angeles. why Gascon I s not to get political? 'cause you know, I don't do It very often. That man has ruined the city. I, I. I'm complete. don I. I'm not even super upset about the social experiment that goes on on our coastlines in New York. And la I never had too much of a, a problem with, you know, ho this sounds crazy. You can't really say you don't have a problem with homeless people, but like the idea that they're going like push around a shopping cart, And, you know, have like weird stuff in It, And, people Are going be smoking meth.


And, they Are doing That Doesn't bother You. I mean because you to be one of themed. It's correct. And also, how do you solve that issue? That's an issue. That's s going take some massaging, right? Bobby Kennedy or someone's s going have to fix this thing, right? The issue is that in LA crime has been decried And that goes all the way Up to like semi violent crime. like it's, they're doing this experiment at the citizens of Los Angeles expense, where they're just like, Oh, You, Know What. You wanna steal from people? You wanna break into houses. You wanna do all these thing possess weapons? We It. That's fine. That's is so weird. Ridiculous. so weird. Angry angering. And ridiculous as I. When I Look at the people That t Know And people that Are paying the highest tax rate in the country.


53% to be robbed, And beaten And And And, tortured by this extremely ridiculous social strategy. So. Nathan Hockman. If you're watching this, you have my vote for go da. Let go. I would love to return some order to the city of Los Angeles. And, if you can fucking outta there, bro. I recognize this unfold. and about three, four years ago, And And, I was able to dip before It. God really bad. My question to you is, do You think That guy Got home thinking He hit the jackpot. And was like Damn. I just Got coffee Pots. It's great coffee. It's 36 count bro. Oh God the big Box bargain. And. Did You see That That robbery? we can maybe even put It on the screen. Yeah He Had a a, a driver way Driver.


He had a getaway driver. Yeah And, an automatic sliding door And that they waited for It to close very slowly. It was like a comedy scene from a movie. Wow. They waited for the door to close all the way. He probably buckled up in the backseat. And And took off with his coffee. It is like a life goal of mine. When I'm at your house to like catch someone trying to rob you. Well Like, like I'll be honest, like if I open the door, And, this guy's stealing one of your packages. Oh Dude, I would punch a hole in his Face a hundred percent I Punch No No, No. But I actually mean I'd punch a hole Yes through his face. Yes, my question is, if you're being robbed in Los Angeles, And, you do something about It, Now am I either criminal A hundred percent.


not even kidding. God. If, if they're, they Oh, God, So. Here's the deal. If they Are posing a certain risk to your bo, meaning if they come in your home, You can You can lay down. Hell fire Now only 10 rounds. But you can lay down hell fire, right? If they're in your house facing you, And, they've broken through a door.

Yeah like Yeah men, people do not talk about how hard It is for women during pregnancy. not, not even just during, during, after Well. I'm sure somebody talk before. I'm sure somebody, I'm sure somebody talks about that No. But because they're clearly not talking to how hard It is for the man. Well, you don't have to do shit. Well, You Just have to keep Don pissing people off with snacks. I'm doing stuff. Now besides the p the pissing off the snack. Pissing off I. Because I've, I've, I've Rec I.

It is, it's S not abnormal. Unless you're a, what's It called? A natural birther. You want blow up a swimming pool in your living room? And pop the baby out there with a fucking, but, but piece of wood Yeah, but sitting under you or something like that. Yeah. But That's Hard. If, but you're not that Well, Well, We. We couldn't be because the baby wouldn't allow It like No. I get It. But also like, Hey man, it's 2024. like, take advantage of the modern science Yeah. But I I. I'll be honest, we can totally see why someone would want to have a home birth. It's the do hospitals.


Are, And, And. We went to a really God hospital with really God staff. But it's like, they're you, Know. It's a hospital. Dude. It's sterile. It's very sterile. Cold. Sterile. It's very sterile. Uninviting. Exactly. I. I brought string lights. Polaroids, That. I clipped up. I had music playing. I brought a blow up mattress like I. I a salt lamp. I turned the hospital room into a vibe. And, thank God. 'cause when We God there, like, you know, Nina was, Nina was not incredibly happy that She had to get induced. It's, it's a bit of a thing, man. It's kind of invasive. And, And, apparently the contractions from an induction, Are like a whole other beast. What. You Know about Pitocin, motherfucker. No, You. Don't I, Don't know anything about a don.

What, were you saying about vaginas? No Pitocin. Okay. Okay. So these contractions. I bet you don't t Know. What. That Is either I do Know. What That means it's, it's a, it's the time in between something opposite. It's, it's, It's, it's, it's something That. There's time in Between Yes.


Exactly. So. The contractions will get closer together. And more intense As it's about to bur closer To the labor. But It takes a while. And, apparently Pitocin contractions. When you Are induced Are like a whole different beast of pain. And, Nina was convinced she's s going do It without an epidural. Do I need to explain that? Okay, I'll do It And epidural's. like essentially kidding a spinal tap. Yeah t Know. 'cause I watched It. The doctors told me, don't watch It. A guys say they're cool. And. They can pass out And. s go, dude, I'm not going pass out. They go, No. Really? like, you shouldn't watch this. You would be the Dude that passes out. Well. That's What. I said, I said. Said, I'll see you said Well. I said I. Don't I I. I said s go. I'm not going pass out And. Then I was like, like, feel like I probably could pass Out.


We can see themed with like smelling salts like fanning your face while she's doing this crazy thing. They said, And, all You did was have to watch Yeah. They said, they go, they go, please don't watch. 'cause if You pass out Now, we have two patients. Yeah, Yeah. I was like So. Anyways, essentially a spinal tap. They, they take a needle. This fucking big And jam It in my fiance's lower spine And And. Then like, go like this with It And. Then, then just load her up with fluids that essentially paralyzes her from the waist down. So She. Can't feel the contractions. And, by the way, thank God. Thank God for modern medicine. Mm, because She really didn't wanna get induced plan out the window. Had to get induced 'cause the baby was too big. And And, she's on week 40. She's ready to go. And. She also did not want to do an epidural.


Wait. What was the weight. 'cause It wasn't even that big of a baby was It Like eight, five or Something. Eight pounds. She was supposed to be eight pounds, 10 ounces. Which it, it's a relatively God baby. It's was kidding there. But She came out much lighter. like the calculations were off I don't, don don't know. But regardless, She, God caught You. Were You were probably a 10 pounder. No. I was a big ass baby, bro. That doesn't surprise me. You, Hey, big Mike Yeah. That's true. Hey, big baby. Mike. Yeah. So. Anyways, epidural. Thank God. Nina was, Nina tried to, to do these contractions for about three hours. you know, it's 4:00 AM And. She goes, babe, I'm hallucinating. I'm like, What. Do you mean She goes I. I'm seeing dogs in this room. Oh ha, And, And, And. What like Hait. Haiti the Haitians with the dogs fire So.


Having a baby makes you hallucinate. No. not kidding. The epidural on Pitocin contractions could make the pain So unbearable. Your body starts to release DMT in the brain to make you hallucinate to try to bear the pain. She goes, I'm kidding. Fuck this. I'm kidding. The epidural I was like, thank God. Why'd you wait this long? like I said, use modern medicine. Epidural bro changed the entire experience. She called It fun at the end. She said That was fun. I said, What the fuck. Yeah. Because She was thought you go through hell, woman. Because She thought She was in space for That period of time. She thought She was falling around at the International Space Station. Yeah. She did. She did. Totally did. Whoa. She absolutely crushed It though. And, And, And, And, And learning all of this stuff.


And, by the way, Now Now that the baby's here. Doctor goes, here's a swaddle. It's like You. Take a piece of cloth. And wrap the baby up. So She doesn't move around at night. Yeah swaddle. This is how You change a diaper. Who don don't know how to fucking change your diaper. Dude You. Gotta make sure You put That diaper rash stuff onto, yep, Yep. Petroleum, ge jelly And I. Also, I'll say this, this will surprise the boys. I'm on diaper duty. I've been allocated diaper Duty. That doesn't surprise me at all. Why? I hate poop. I hate, disgusting thing for, I'll be honest. That's disgusting. Until you see this little child. And You. Realize I love You So much. I'll literally do anything for you, including this with pleasure little lady.


And, So. I. Love It Now. I'm on. I'm on Diaper dad duty. And, Oh God. A message for all the dads out there. That Are, unwilling to change diapers. You're a fucking pussy. Show up for your kids. Help your wife out. Seriously, it's s not that Bad. I Hope. I hope the diaper Dad's beat you up. Lemme tell you something. No one. No one's beat me up, bro. Yeah, that's a God point. Except maybe LA Night. think Think Bradley can do It. If You give not chance. I'm come Bay Chance. What. Did You just say I think Bradley can do It It if You give him not chance. Anytime, any Day. I just went on his show to finally unpack It all. How'd It go? Wait, hold on before we get there, right? 'cause I wanna get there. I was going ask You if the birth had any, any sentimental or directional changes on your thoughts on mortality for Sure. Wow. It's clear to me, That, like this is not a next chapter.


This is an an entirely new book. This is an entire, like the book Closed, new life begins And. We can feel already with the birth of this baby. Time's s going fly, man. She's s going be my age, way quicker than I. Realize. It, And. I'm going be What. 58, 64, 75. don don't Know. How old does that make me? At that point? Probably not even I mean 74. No. No. No, No, No. I'm locked in Yeah. I'm locked in. Okay. My grandmother was 94. Oh. My God, my grandfather was 94. No. My No way. Yes, I'm locked in. That's just on my mom's side. My dad's side didn't fare.


So, Well, I. Hope you Got your mom's jeans. That's not thing. Thank God. This baby has Nina's jeans most of themed, all the God ones that I I was really nervous about this. like, okay, we're talking to birthing a lo, a low baby girl And. I'm like, all right. right. I would much rather prefer She comes out with that Scandinavian olive skin. Nina's thick, long hair, Luscious locks, Luscious lock, not You. know me. I'm like, I'm thinning. I'm pale. ve like don I. don, don't God. don don't I. I feel like I would feel bad for her. Sure enough, man, this baby comes out with all the best parts of Nina And. She has my eyes, And really long lashes as Well. She's just such a, she's such a cute little like creature.


It's almost like you can't even believe she's real Yeah. Why don't You save That shit for call her daddy, dude, okay, you sent a bunch of prime to North Carolina Yeah for, to, to help as a relief for this awful Hurricane Helene. Is that how you pronounce It? Helene, right? I don't watch any news anymore, but I I, just Know. It's been absolutely terrible. People. Are displaced people. Are missing people. Are dead. And. I saw That. You sent that stuff over on Twitter. And, one of the comments was, this was all just pulled off shelves for pfas last week in every grocery Like Yeah. I hear that. I hear, not only is That not true, You know It wasn't pulled off shelves. We don't have forever chemicals in our drink.


It's Just the, the, the lawsuit was frivolous. The plaintiff is full of shit. It's was kidding. It. Got dismissed. I don't like It irks me to my cord. The amount of don't, you can't let It misinformation. It's life. It's life. In the new era, it's life on X And on TikTok, I, I had this conversation. We could go to Bradley Martin Now, because I had this conversation on his show the other day. You, You almost just have to work around It. P the idea that there was not, if you're Me idea, not if you're Me, No, No, No, I. Hear you. And. You can call It out. But your call out And, your settlements in court will get one 100th of the press. That the pa And that, that's the issue. So. If anyone's s going on, on the, on the Caffeine lawsuit, prime is too much caffeine. C, you in court class action. Dismissed.


Do you think anyone's s going report on that? No. I. Hear You, but like trying to battle It online. I, don't believe anything I hear anymore. like s go online. s go. P, you know how, remember how they said X was And, And. All these social media channels we're going replace the mainstream news. And And, the mainstream news. Are Liars, Yeah, that Are, That, Are, corporate God, God, greed, God, And, God, God, And, God aligned with companies. God, God, Now. You have click baiting X users, Oh My God, who Are kidding, paid to do the same shit. God. And worse. And worse. Because I'll tell you this, don I, don, I'm ready to say, I've said this a million times. It, there is at least some level of journalistic responsibility. And some level of oversight there, bro. You go on ex the shit's insane. Mikey. It. Is.


it is completely And, utterly just unhinged. It Is a shithole. Shithole. Yes. A shithole full of falsehood. Untruths. Defamatory statements. No One being held accountable. 'cause they have anonymous accounts. A platform that is supposed to have an entity. That regulates truth. Community notes, lies is That not, I've been seen your battles because Yeah, that's So funny because, 'cause it's one of my, the only thing I actually like about the platform that He at least is trying to do with the community notes. You get smoked Well because bro, You, think about It. You have a community of people, humans, right? And, who Are the type of people you think sign Up to put notes on people.


People that in real life have No power. But on Twitter, Yeah, Yeah, they can put What. They want on their notes. And, as long as It gets enough up votes by enough people who ain, Logan, Paul, Whether. It's true or not. It's deemed as truth. And. like people don't see that in community notes. Fucking, they smoke me, bro. And, I have a real problem. like, dude, if, if I ever get to talk to Elon, the one thing I'm going say to him is, is, is is the community notes issue? It's a major issue. It's S not the only, bro. If It's s not the only. If I, If I notes out of It, Dude, lemme tell You. Two people have had huge comebacks on X over the past year. Hitler's number one, Oh. My God, Hitler has made a massive comeback on x Oh. My God, Oh my God. He's being elevated. He's, he's being called a statesman.


Insane And in a, a insane, a promoter of nationalist beliefs that will keep the country together. I'm seeing this happen in real life. People Are actively rewriting history in real life. And there Are, And there. Are, obviously the, the, the dumbest of of Americans. And, And, people out there, Are buying It, but also kids, kids Are reading this stuff. And saying like, Oh. There, there, you know, there were wooden doors. There weren't even any gas chambers. There were swimming pools at Auschwitz. And, No. 'cause They're falling for the propaganda. That the same thing Hitler said back then. Because AI is translating It into English. Now, they can understand What. Hitler was saying in English, But guess What, it's translating the thing that He said.


That weren't bad. Entangle don, but He gave speeches on a, a myriad of topics, bro. Yeah, Yeah. But guess What. He also did killed millions of fucking people, bro. Okay, So like I, I don't care how much that ha like for me, t Know the truth. But It just is, it's, it's scary to watch And. Painful to imagine where it's s going go. Especially 'cause like, unfortunately, most humans Are not in a spot where they can discern the truth. People Are, idiots, And, they don't even know That. They're So stupid. They don't even know they're stupid. So. You. See a headline? And, it's s not, Hmm. Does That sound like It could be true? It's that must be true.


It's on X. Everyone's an expert. I I had a chiropractor on INSTAGRAM say definitively that the drink had PFAS in It. Fucking dumbass, fucking dumbass. I. Guess What, Logan, I'm sorry. Don't shoot the messenger. Shut the fuck up. Stupid. like bro. No one. not even the, not even the experts, the smart people, Are able to tell what's true or not. Because No one's willing to do their research. My self Included. Fuck. I'm one of 'em, Bro. And, here's where, where I'll land. I'm confused. I'm fucking confused. Yeah, Yeah, What. The hell is going on.


What the hell is going on. What's true? And? Where can I find out if it's true or not? Does an XX chromosome make you a female or not? Because that's What. I was taught in school. I taught. I was taught. XX means you're a woman. And, XY means you're a man. I did, I did four or five years of AP sciences. What Biology is What. I was taught So. What. Explain It to me. I wanna be I, wanna be Educated? I'm not, dude. I'm not one of those people who sticks my stake in the ground. And like this. Hell, don. S not s not s not an absolutist. I'm not t Know, I'm not don I. don I. don I. I'm just not And Here.


I am bringing a daughter into The world thinking, Oh, my gosh, there's a chance She can work her whole life to become an Olympic sprinter. think, think she's s going be a sprinter. Her legs move like this. And, she's super long. And, And, And And here. I. See, you know, 20 years old going to the Olympics. She, she's, she's, she's competing for, for first place. And, And. And, a biological male comes in And, And beats her. Dude, that would fucking break my heart. I, don't I, do not believe that is fair. And And. That is a value. I will stay true to till I. don Yes, absolutely I don't believe that's fair. No I agree with you. I, And, And And And And I woke up on Twitter, That morning. Everyone's saying the same thing. Biological male beats biological female in a boxing match. I'm like, Jesus Christ.


Physical Violence, Yeah, Yeah. not even, it's S not even like, not even the swim meet with Leah Thomas. Just crushing everybody. not even the, the, the biological male playing female volleyballs, spiking the ball. So hard. She's paralyzing. Women from the neck down. Safety, fuck, safety. The Now, they're fighting. Holy shit. Yeah. That's Crazy. You Got It. That's s why you gotta come over here. And. Sit on the fence with me, man. No offense. My tweets Are way different. No offense. Because I Don't ever have to say, my tweet was like this. A maybe woman man fought a woman. And maybe was a too hard hippo. Who knows if this really happened, but if It did happen, maybe That wasn't So God of a thing to happen. Yeah, Yeah, And. Then when people Are like, what's the deal with this tweet? I'm like, don, don't know. can You even read It? Yeah? Who knows? What. It fucking says, nah, dude.


Fence is chill. No. I don't like I don't like the fence. don don't like dude. Because, because I tell You why. Deescalate situation. Like, because if you don't stand for anything, You, don't stand for nothing. I don't stand. Yeah try. Have you tried sitting So? Much better. It's So much better. It's So Much better. why would I bro, can I tell you why? I'll tell you why. How far has all of your one arm up in the air fucking attempts gotten You? Billion dollar brand No, WW champion, No, No, No, No, No, You can, I'm not talking to that stuff. I'm not talking to lunch in a upsetting snack, But What, Are Talking to on offensive snack. What, Do You mean How far has It Got me? I'm doing great. That's s not the shit I'm talking to. Whatcha talking to. I'm talking to on these type of issues. On these type of issues, Who gives a fuck?


Social media's s not real life. I'll say It again. Well. Why'd you say Whoopsies? Oopsies. Okay. not real life. Bradley Martin said Next time, time, he'll lock in. wait, Wait a second. If there's a next time, yep. It's s going be exponentially worse. No. No not okay. He said, He said. He said you came in at two 60 or two. At least two 50. And. You corrected him. I'm Sorry. Of course, I said What was the wait by the way. I was I said I said A of I. I. I have a picture of It. Said I said. I said. My guess was like two 10. No. No. I have a picture of It was less than That. Yeah. I. think It was.


It was like two Oh. wait, 2 1 9. No. His his No I. think I was I. think It was like two Oh. Three. Two Oh. Two I. Have a picture. we can put It. His main thing. His main thing was, was leaning on It being a stamina situation on his part. Shut the fuck up. You think it's s going get better for you. Stupid What. If He gets it's It stamina. think It And. By the way, its And by way. It adrenal because You Couldn't handle It. Excuse me. His demeanor towards the conversation was a little bit more professional. Yeah. That's What happens when you get fucked ass. No. No, excuse me, That's What happens when your ego takes a hit. Excuse me, you get humbled. It was a little bit more, more kidding. That's called professional. That's called humility. Conversation regarding tactics. And stamina. There's No reason for these low blowing insults, tactics.


He said you had clearly been abusing drugs. t Know you said, said That weighed He said two. Two. That's What happens When You get your Ass beat. 2 85. He said you came in at 2 85. You had to steal, steal arm a a bionic arm like Jack's don, mortal Kombat. can I ask You, Can we can I ask You one thing on that What Because I, 'cause he's right No in That regard, he's right. I do have a titanium rod in my hand, bro. Was He able to tell No I Don't think So Damn He just said He was really tired. Which, which actually is true. He was tired. Alright, but Stamina's most important thing. Tired. Tired. Mike. Mike. I'll Let. You say It. How long did that last?


No I get What. You're saying No No answer 60 I. Don't fucking know What. Do You. think think don 40, 45 to 60. I'm not don s not probably 60 seconds. not s, not That's What. I would've Said G Gs GB told me a tired black belt is a white belt. He's right, Right? He said, stamina is every very wise. He said a white wise thing. Yeah, Very wise thing to say, What Is GSPs. s greatest combat sports. Guess What Time. What. Guess What. Nobody gets tired in 60 seconds. You can do anything for 60 seconds if you're a bodybuilder like Bradley Martin. The reason He Got Tired is 'cause He was put in a stressful environment that he's s not used to mentally or physically fighting. It's called an adrenaline dump. His adrenaline Got dumped in the first 15 seconds because He realized he's in over his head. And. He's fighting someone who's s not going get tired ever And.


If I do, I won't. I really just wanted know why He was mad at me. 'cause that's What, I was stressed out about. 'cause remember, He was like, I told you, It was, You made the blog out. It bro. It's a hit. That's What. He said I asked Jor. Jorge iterated It perfectly. He said a He. Really, probably thought He was going beat me And then if He, if on the off chance He didn't think he was going beat me, He didn't think It was going be That easy con Oh That bad, or that there would be content about It. Bro, Bro, bro, like, that's A pretty vulnerable Position for a guy like, bro. I could have killed him. If we're in a street. I'm going go, I'm going kill you motherfucker. like, your life is in my, the palm of my hand. And. I didn't. But it's, it'll, it'll, it'll fuck with you as a man. It'll fuck with You. You. go I. See, that's the part that I don't get And. Maybe it's because I'm not like a combat sports athlete, but the idea that I'm going Step up And.


This is What I try to portray in the content, which is why I didn't understand his, his, his disappointment in It was that if I'm going step up against a trained combat sports athlete, And go for a while, And then just get kind of like tapped out in the end. I'm going, ve like, bro, if you went And played basketball against LeBron tomorrow, right? not That, you're LeBron of combat sports. If anything, you're like Spud Webb or fucking some, fucking, some Unac accomplished. He's laughing. Yeah. Do you know who that is? Yeah Spud Webb. Because I have, I have No idea. He, He's like five foot eight or something. like That dude. But, but I just mean, like, if you went And played against a LeBron tomorrow, And, you Got beat 21 to two Yeah, or 21 to zero even. Would you be thinking to yourself, Oh, my God, I'm So offended.


like it's different. Don, my ego took such a big Hit. Don, you, you don't play fight. You don't play fighting No. But I get It. But it's still a sport at the end of the day. not It's s not even remotely comparable. Mike. I'm talking to a situation where I could have killed him easily. If You went up easily. If you went up And. If you went up And fought MMA tomorrow against John Jones. And. He beat my ass. And He Beat the which, which He would And He beat the, the break off right? Would decimate you would be saying What the next day. I Got in the ring with John Jones. Bro, That's What. I'm trying to say to You. Yep. Yep. That's the part. I just don't understand about It like And. I'm not saying It's because he's s not been humbled. He's s not been humbled. That part makes sense. That's, that's one beautiful thing about fighting. Which, which is why the the art of Pugilism is, is incredible. It can It can make a man So a much better version of himself if he's willing to take that humility.


And, learn from It. And, get in the ring. And do better. It's Don wonders for me. And my brother. We've both been humbled. you know, you You You show up one day. And. You have a hard sparring session. And, you have to sit on the edge of the ring like, hmm, Oh, God, Oh God. Some I Got some thing to revisit. But when You do you You You, get in there. You get in the gym, You revisit And. Then you make a better version of yourself through you. You forge a better version of yourself with mental And, physical fortitude. And, you know, I I. Don't know if don don't, don don't. I don't know much about like Brad's personal character, but like how, how fast He quit made me think He doesn't have That in him because I bet next time He Quit equally. But No, stama, No. But stamina is the decider of that Mike. It's s not stamina.


We can tell you as someone who does Know, Bradley very Well He He. The per mental perseverance is not something He struggles with. He's been, he's been through enough shit to Then why He quit that quick Be, bro. If you're fucking D going die of not being able to breathe air, you're going, you have No choice. His body was not prepared For that. What did. He He didn't even do anything. Mike He. Got taken down. That punched He. Punched He. The head Yeah. You said adrenaline dump. He probably tried to put a ton of energy into the choke. It's s Not stamina is What. I'm telling you, stamina isn't the It shouldn't be the excuse. The excuse should be I. Am not a fighter. Well Fighter, Well, And, He Lost Yeah. Andy, Andy, Got, Attack. don. s not fighter. Just say It, you're not a fight. It's s not fair, Brad.

Okay, I'm going allow you to select one of these next topics. Right? Right. Here we go. I fired my baby nurse I. Ha. I did have one. I did the rich people thing.


Why? I realized the idea of someone else. Raising my child in any capacity is a fucking crazy thought. What What about nannies. Yeah. We'll get nannies out. Pure necessity. And, I'm realizing that Now, But like everyone that has the ability to do It has a baby nurse. W And. And We tried, but I I fired her within the first hour. 'cause She was just So bad. Mike. She was So bad. Oh It was a bad baby Nurse. She Horrible. Oh. Well, that's different. No. But I Thought You meant like No, but No, but worked for Ble. It worked for, worked for all these other people like, you know, a resume. That. That We thought was all right. And, I, I, I. Get in I. I arrive to the house that we're staying at, right?


Now with, with my my child. Exhausted from the hospital. you know, first night just learning how to be a dad. I, sit on the couch. S me on my chest relaxing. I'm, I'm in my happy, happy place. Baby nurse comes over, by the way, barely Know. This woman interviewed her, her a few times on the, on the Zoom. She comes over. She goes, okay, wake the baby Happy has two feet. She has two feet. Oh. She have to feel. go. All She was go aggressive. go overbearing is the word. Helicopter. Baby Nurse in, in She. 30 red flags. Within 15 minutes. And So, I took her aside. And I said I have to just, I'm going be candid with you 'cause we're We gotta communicate. You're a, a roommate. Now. And also like you're our baby nurse. Because sounds Like something that would've happened at White Oak back in the day.


Yeah. Remember when we used to have to manage people? Yes, And, Now. It's Well. You did Yeah. Now. I have to Yeah. Mina's like, can you handle It? I'm feeding my baby. I'm exhausted. I'm like, fuck. I gotta be can I Got And You suck at It. I. I was So bad Suck. s go. s go. I have to be candid with you. So, right off the rip You have to, you can with me. You're dead to me. You're, you're, you're come across Well. She made Nina Nina cry. 'cause I I left her a No alone with Nina And. This woman was do this, do this, do this, do this do And. It was just, It was just too much. And And. Nina goes, she's like, it's just So hectic. She's So hectic. And I was like, you're come across like pretty overbearing. And I gave her some very candid feedback about her style. And, just like in general, she's way too loud, just like trying to control everything.


And, I, And, And, And. Afterwards, when I realized I I I didn't see my information, And my feedback being downloaded by her s go. It's very important to me that t Know that you Are capable of downloading, And, receiving the feedback that I'm giving you. God And, She starts laughing at me, not at me. She just starts laughing. Cackling s go. This isn't super funny, like, What What Are. You laughing at She goes, You, Are just So serious s go. Are, you capable of implementing the notes That, I'm giving You involving how to raise And deal with my child.


Was this What Her face looked like when She was Yes, Yes Mike She had No idea. What I was incapable of understanding What. I was saying, didn't even know the our our name. By her name. By the way, you, after, after, after I fi, after I fired her, I I We Got our car. We God her out of there. She texted a thing, No hard feelings. And, by the way, I b I, bookended It with with incredible I was like, I don't want this to be awkward. like anything you need from us the rest of the night. like, literally tell us, you know, gi, gimme a hug. I, I'm sorry if I No, you hug her. I did. I said, I'm sorry if I upset you. She goes anything, any, anything. I need. s go. Yeah. She goes, can you sign six bottles of prime? s go. Actually Yeah S go. That's actually Insane. s go re right I. I a hundred percent made the right decision. Jesus, mother of God She was a fan.


Yeah sends a, my kids love It. Yeah. Grandkids sends a, sends a long text. No, hard feelings, anything you need, Baby, Esm, asthma, So, cute Baby, Esm. Asthma. Asthma. Didn't even know my daughter's name. Well, maybe She wasn't sure if It was a daughter. So She was leaving the name open-ended, bro. Two days later. Two days later, me, And, Nina sitting on the couch. She's in the closet. No text from her. Esme, No, just one word. Yeah. No way. No way. not even, not even the asterisk. Unreal. Because She realized two days after she'd been calling her the wrong name. Even though It was written on the birth certificate on a, on a welcome Estimate, maybe She thought She was texting SME directly.


I think She realized. She called our daughter the wrong name. And. And. Also probably why That relationship didn't work out. All right, Your choice. Costco guys, who they bring the boom, Yeah, I, Oh. you know, You can do, you can do You can do Ang or You can do, or you can do Nitrogen, Gas. Execution in Alabama. I'll do the last one. Okay. What the hell. Alabama executed a condemned man Thursday using nitrogen gas in only the second instant in the United, in the United States of the methods use, which drew criticism from some human rights groups. What'd He do? I don't have that here in my notes. Come on, Mike. come on. What do You Do? Okay, Well, let's Well Well those questions.


Are? Fair enough, dude. So important. Well, Well. The question is important because What, do You have to do to be killed in an exotic format. What's exotic? Nitrogen gas. How is That exotic? It seems exotic. why? It seems like they would say, do You want the nitrogen, nitrogen gas? Or would You prefer It to be trampled by elephants? I feel like nitrogen gas is probably painless. No, That's What, they say, but So So like, okay, how, how, how does It work like this? Let's, let's find out. They're euthanizing people. Pretty Mainly Now process of death by nitrogen gas involves forcing Well the way they put this is terrible. Forcing an inmate to inhale one hundred percent nitrogen gas sentenced to death in 2000 for the 1999 killings of three men in Alabama.


It It. It's death by nitrogen hypoxia. A controversial method critic say is tantamount to torture. Cool. Sounds God to me. Fucking bring back the electric chair. If it's Up to me. Murderers. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em. All Well. Don don't think that's how It works. don don't, don don't think they're I. Don't think, think they're supposed to torture him. Why not kill him? Make It, make his life Know, No, No, I. Wonder how those three men's families felt probably torture him, huh? It's a, it's a God for the rest of their life as Well. Fuck off. Kill 'em. Well. Okay, Well. like we have, we have the Geneva Convention as It pertains to war. like, like What. What. You're saying I.


I. Hear What, you're saying I, I get the sentiment, but governmental killing And. Just And just sense the sentencing of death in general is, is is a complex topic. Is It I. think So shouldn't be, shouldn't be. Because, because lemme ask you a question because then you're, 'cause then you're giving the government or the prison system the right to go truly eye for an eye with someone who did a really evil thing. So, So, So I. Guess the question is like, Does that seem, do We trust our government to maintain that responsibility? That's a fair point. No, not even that, but like, not right Well. That should be the top, right? not, not even that, but like, does, doesn't It does that then just make themed as bad as the person who did the deed?


Do? Do you know? What? I'm saying like No No No. The, the, the, the, the issue And, the, the conversation I will be here for is like putting That much power in the government's hands does scare me because they make mistakes. Yeah And cannot be trusted as You know. Well would. They just had that big one last week with the guy that was Like, It would be a shame to if You The guy that there was evidence That He met, may or may not have actually committed the crime And. They were asking for a stay Well. That, That's, that's What. I'm saying like, if you're Wrong, I probably should have his name. But Like, if, if they're wrong, that's a Damn shame in The world, where thing always Don, It happens, go black, And white. like in that regard, I I. Totally. See, but if you're absolutely, if you're on video someone or Killing themed Yeah Like, bro, put nitrogen gas up your fucking asshole.


That's What. I Would do. I. think that's What. They do Sick. So, So, He. He was, He was the shaking. And trembling was fo Miller's shook And, trembled on the gurney for about two minutes with his body at times being pulled against the restraints, which had to report the shaking. And trembling was followed by about six minutes of periodic gulping breaths. Sounds. That's kind of long. Sounds pretty fucking Gru. Gruesome No. But What, I'm just saying is like, to your point, Wanda is like, is like What if the wrong type shit like, like sucks. It's like It comes down to the same thing when we waterboarded terrorists like Now. That's like, fuck, Fuck 'em. What, do You mean f why Baltimore? But, But okay, I'm clearly not the right, the the person to be speaking on behalf of terrorists.


right? Now, okay. We need, right? Because I was kind, give us our terrorist rights. Well, because I was kind of with that too. Because I was on the east coast during nine 11. And like saw that shit all unfold. So I was like, okay, fuck. like, like What, What changed. Pour some, pour some water on these dudes, bro. You know, What, I'm saying pour some fucking water on their heads. Dude. What changed. Dude. Make 'em talk I. Don't think anything. I'm just simply, I'm just simply reporting S for the you questions, No. I'm simply reporting for the people who have had problem with. This is a very God conversation. Yeah. It's, I'm not saying that we should have much more of It today, but It it, it's an interesting conversation because What, Are you willing to do to the people who, who make It their life's goal to harm the people of your country.


So. And, by the way that goes for murder, domestic murderers, Yeah, And, terrorists. like, where does that? And, And. So And, What. We, And What. We have Don as a country has always been walk the line. Super gray area, shit. Yeah, because the Geneva Convention provided a set of laws, And standards for how to con how governments should conduct themselves during warfare times. Yep. Incendiary devices were outlawed. Napal. You can't fire bomb a fucking town. Yeah, because it's s going have incredible amounts of collateral damage because fire is not It doesn't choose What. It's s going burn. It just burns, right? So, all of that stuff happened. And, And, Now You still see It Now where there Are actually laws from the Geneva Convention.


That dictate What the allowable amount of collateral. Civilian death is by way of God God What target was spo God God So, okay, So. If You Oh, my God So. If you're trying to bomb an office building Yeah, because there's one senior leader in It, Yeah Yeah, there's only x amount of people that You can kill as a result of that. Oh, My God. But if you're going to bomb a weapons depot, which has the ability to take out entire fucking countries, Yeah, the, the allowable human collateral damage as a result of that bombing is actually a much larger number. Whoa So. There. It's, it's crazy At a macro level. What we're talking to, right?


Now is, is the discussion, And debate around value of human life. And, And, when that value changes based on the deeds of a person who has Don something wrong. Yeah, it's a, it's, I'm not saying anything right or wrong 'cause I'm going sit on the fence as always, but it's Acra it's a strange conversation to have. It is extremely strange. If It were possible, ideally I think the punishment should sort of match the crime. like how, how much suffering did this guy cause? The three people He murdered He probably shot him. So, Is it fair then that they died. What instantly minutes.


don don't know And. Then He It took him six minutes to die. So, if each don don't know, if each one lived for two minutes after He shot him, And, there's a total of six minutes of themed dying. Then Yeah I think six minutes. Choking on nitrogen gas is like burning Well. why don't they just shoot em Well? 'cause maybe the suffering that He caused those three men And the harm that their families will endure for the rest of their life is not equivalent to an easy death bite way of Shooting What. If they were not God dudes. What. If they were gang members, a Lot of nuance Yeah. That's What. I'm saying that's s why It's don Don't t know What. They were, they, they could have been fucking, they could have been baby nurses. What, So, What you're describing is like shitty Baby nurses.


Shitty male So. Look, if this guy was on some vigilante shit, And killing people, And, then He God killed You. Know I. don don don't know Yeah. Like, like how long would You waterboard Batman For So? So So I don't have Answer. That smart ass would You fire bomb Spider-Man's village. Because He accidentally heard an old woman who was buying groceries while He was fighting against fucking Dr. Octagon does, what's that guy's name? Dr. Och. Doc och. Dude. That. like there was Dude. Imagine a woman, right? like, okay, You have like Gertrude, we'll call her Oh. God. She's crossing the street with her cart filled with lemons, oranges, And like kale. Yeah, right? Spider-Man's chasing Dr. Rock knocks Gertrude over She hits her head on an NYC. Fire hydrant. Oh. God And dies.


Oh. My God So Now. They put Spider-Man up on trial, right? Yeah, it's being reported about an X Spider-Man hates Jews. Here's the proof, like the whole thing. You Know, What. I'm saying like, So, that all happens. What's the retribution for Spider-Man for this accidental killing of Gertrude who is just trying to bring groceries on to watch prices, right? know don I. Don I. don, Do you know What? I'm saying you're No nuances. You're re right. You're Absolutely right. Yeah. It's, they're all incredibly nuanced. I'm sure there's information about this particular killing. That That That, this condemned man That I just don't have Well because I didn't prepare. Well. The context, the con context when You talking to euthanasia is very important. I, I. We should have gone with Mo Dang It.


Would that Dude? We a hundred percent should have gone Mo fucking dang Dude. What is the deal with that little hippo. He's a little fucker bro. Yeah, he's the cutest thing ever bites What's He doing? He runs around bites people's knees. He is, he's the greatest dude. I always knew there was something with hippos. They're So. Great Yeah until they get really big Mike. They get huge. Like they can really cause real damage. Yeah You know how many people die by Hippo per year. It's a, it's a pretty high number. Isn't It It Yeah Higher, higher than You? think I'll use my chat. GPT voice box. How many people die by Hippo every year? Hippos. Are. Surprisingly dangerous animals, while the exact number varies, it's estimated that hippos kill around 500 people each year.


That's a lot of People. They're basically terrorists. And. While Udane might look cute, Now, That, motherfucker could be very dangerous. We. Got. A waterboard. Mo Muang. We. Got. A waterboard. Ang And. Find out What He knows about these fucking terrorists. Dude, Yeah know What does. He Know No I love themed though Yeah, all, all man animals.
