You are the voice of WWE e Fox Loss. It's Michael Cole. Thanks guys. I am so excited to be here. We were talking right before the rumble. I just said, Hey, I should do your show one time. Do you wanna know why it happened so quick? Huh? Tiffy Time CANCELLED on us. Oh, I'm a replacement for Tiffy. There to go guys. You, we need stories so our fans can emotionally invest in our characters. Why do they hate Logan Paul? Because he's a Cocky Prick. Right? And the crowd surfing thing was wild. That would've never happened under Vince McMahon. Michael Cole Ying on a table would never happen. Trying to dap up rappers would've never happened under Vince McMahon. But I was the original yeet, by the way. Yo, you Did, did Jay steal it from you? Yeet? Yes. And I'm sending him cease to the assist. Not A work.


I had a little runback when I was a heel where I actually got in the ring. Terrible, terrible what I did, but I took bumps. Right. Couldn't have been worse than mine. Watch WrestleMania in 2011 when I had my match with Jared. You know, I know at the time we're about to go on the air live. It's all this pressure. I see Pat walk into Gorilla with these shorts on. What the fuck are you doing? Then he stormed off and I'm like, where the fuck are you going? I'm not doing this. She What? Let's talk about it. My gosh. Caleb, you rolling? Yes, sir. Shelby rolling? Yes, sir. Ask me something. Mike, Are you rolling? Yeah, not right now. That would be a show, right?


That would be a show. In show would be okay. Oh man. I'm so proud to say this. Ladies and gentlemen. It's Michael Cole. Thanks guys. I'm so excited to be here. Really veteran. Seriously. It's funny when we, we were talking right before the Rumble about some stuff and I just said, Hey, I should do your show one time. And he's like, oh my God, let's do it. I didn't, he's pumped. I didn't ex He's pumped. I didn't expect to get a text though, while I'm drinking in the bar at 1230 at night to say, Hey, can you be at the, the Hyatt at 12 o'clock tomorrow? Do You wanna, do you wanna know why it happened so quick? Huh? Tiffy Time CANCELLED on us. Oh, so, oh, I'm a replacement for Tiffany. There you go guys. Thanks. Thank you. No, thanks. No, I Can, I can be honest about it. 'cause I told you, I told when you said I gotta the, on your podcast, I was like, yeah.


Yes. Like it'll happen. Eventually we stagger the wrestlers. 'cause people just call us a wrestling podcast, which is partially true. It's a big part of my life now. But yeah, we had Tiffany on and she canceled and we were like, dangs, like we're screwed. And I was like, I just had this conversation with Michael, shot in the dark. Let's see if he's available. So, dude, Yes. Why did she, why did she cancel? Is it Somebody told me it's 'cause she's like super big time Right now. Yeah, she big time to us. She, oh, she did. She doing, I think she's doing Rogan today. Oh, really? Is she big? That's the woman's world Champ, right? She's, Yeah, she's doing a whole media tour, like, yeah. Yep. So, dude, Michael Cole. So wait a minute, let's get back to Tiffany for a second. What, what? I saw this go viral. What happened with What?


The Whole Vvi Kaiser protecting his girl thing, dog. This was the, this is the dumbest narrative that Bro, I don't even want, I don't even wanna feed in. Michael Hayes is the one who started this. Of course he is, bro. We think he, he, I was, I was just telling Tiffany like a good peer. Like if you ever needed advice on how to be a good wrestler or like anything. I know she's the woman's champion, but I, I'm the, the champion of everything. So I was just like, yo, if you want to learn how to do a, a good moon salt, better frog splash, like I can help you. And Michael Cole came up to, or Michael Michael Hayes. Sorry. You're Michael Cole. Long night. Very Long Night. Very long Night. He was like, he's like, busted.


You're, you are flirting with Tiffany. And I'm like, Michael, I'm just, I'm just being a friendly guy. And then Ludwig took it wrong and then tried to attack me backstage with a chair. 'cause I was flirting with his girl or so he thought, like, I just, I'm not, I'm not here to cause drama, bro. I don't want any problems. I'm here to win. Yeah. Big time rivalry though. Develop maybe, bro, you and Kaiser, There's no rivalry. There's no, there's nothing, bro. There's like, these guys are peanuts to me. Let's be honest. You know. Oh, There peanuts. That, that's really gonna go over well with Kaiser. Bro. There's peanuts to me, bro. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm wrestling the big matches, bro. The elimination chambers, the top three of the rumble, like you were announcing top three of Royal Rumble And and you had an incredible move too, off the ring to the announced table, to the barricade, to the steps to back end.


Brother. How Did you take to this so quickly? No, Michael, this is your podcast. No, but I do have a serious question. Yeah. I've, and I've been wanting to ask you this. I've done this for 28 years now. I've never seen anyone take to the business as quickly as you have now. McAfee, who's obviously my partner, Pat's done great in the ring. He's incredible. But you just came aboard and like, it was awesome. Like how Thanks. Thanks, Michael. Seriously, the, the, the answer is I think far less exciting than you'd think. I wrestled like the majority of my younger life. Right. And I did a ton of stunts for YouTube videos. Okay. Yeah. Right. If you like, it kind of made perfect sense.


And I would end up right where I am. And then you obviously had the talk and shit being the villain. And now it's kind of like everything at all. I was in athleticism too. Like, it's like, it's like when you watch him last night, 'cause, 'cause you know, this has been a couple years brewing now, and there's been so many times where I've like talked about like, as an outsider looking in his level of athleticism. But when you see him enter the ring with the caliber of talent that was in that ring last night, it's so palpable. The level that he's on. Like, I don't think anyone could actually do. Wow. Thank you. Like I've written. No, I'm serious. I really, really noticed it when you entered last into the ro like, and you have seen all these people's, You know, seen a punk and, and, and all the, You know, new guys, old guys, everybody.


And you're out there walking on this railing and I'm thinking to myself, I'm like, dude, I know this kid very well, but is there a chance he fall? There's no chance he falls. He's gonna, he's gonna nail it. He's fully focused. He's fully locked in. What do you say about the wall? First off that, that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me. And I, and I'm, I think people see, really see it, dude. Honestly, Can, can I tell you a quick story? Yeah, of course. Before we get into your podcast about that, that table jump. Yeah. Do you know how many people came up to me and didn't think I would make that jump? Bro. I had, I had like seven producers come up to me and they said, are you sure you can make that jump? I say, bro, I am certain. I like, there is 0% chance I don't make that jump.


'cause it was like a nine foot leap. You Nailed it. Did you have a backup plan for a miss? No. Right. Which is good. No, he would've been eliminated. So No, no, no. Which is, well, which is good too, because it's like almost like a manifestation of that miss happening. Did you pr did you practice the jump A couple times? A couple A couple actual ring, two table? No, no. Just, just the distance. No. Yeah. Yeah. Do you think that, do you think that his, his skills and his ability to do it there would potentially translate to a traditional, like, like could you go to the standing long jump and compete in the I did the long jump. You did? Of course he did. Yeah. What else haven't you done? No, I'm, I'm a jack of all trades. Multi hyphen throw you off. Stop. Stop. Michael. Michael, Michael, this is your podcast.


This is exciting for me, Bro. This is exciting for me. I think what you do is probably the most impactful part of what we do. You are the voice of wwe e you are telling the stories for, for anyone tuning in who isn't a fan or in the WWE universe, you're the one connecting the dots and lit, literally painting the picture with your words so people can follow the story. And in my opinion, the wwe e storylines are so rich. And that's what sets the universe apart and the organization apart. That's why it's worth, You know, multiple billions of dollars. And you're the one painting the, the, the canvas for the Viewer.


Well, and that's why Netflix wanted us, right? I mean, Netflix understands that we're a storytelling entity first. We're not professional wrestling anymore. We haven't been for many years. We're an entertainment product. Yeah. And we, we need stories so our fans can emotionally invest in our characters. Why do they hate Logan Paul? Because he's a Cocky Prick. Right. And I wasn't aware I was as a, as a, as a character. A I was, my people hated him. Hated me. But I feel, I feel loved and revered. Oh yeah. After the entrance last night, the loudest boo of the Evening. His mom, his mom said last night, I, I probed his mom.


I I queried his mom about this last night at McDonald's. I said, at McDonald's? Yeah. I said, we went there for, I said, I said, Pam, are you, are you aware of the number of people who dislike your son? And, and she said, those people are simply wrong. That's her answer to it. She's like, no, no, no. I'm like, there's so, there's no world where you could see a criticism, right? She's like, absolutely not. They're simply wrong. I was like, okay, my mom's great mother. That's My, she's great mom. Right? She's amazing. But, but no, again, we're, we're an entertainment product. And it, it's the emotional connection. Whether you're a bad guy or a good guy. It is one of the reasons we're on Netflix Now.


I tell people all the time, I've never pretended in 28 years to be a professional wrestling announcer. I'm not, whatcha talking about, I'm a narrator. I'm a storyteller. I'm a pitch man. I'm a play by play announcer. Okay. Somewhat. I embellish stories, I create characters. I'm a jack of all trades. And I've never, I think that's the one thing that when I first started my career here, one of the reasons the fans hated me because I wasn't a professionally wrestling announcer. Mm. But I just think over the years they've come to respect the work ethic.


And they also understand that, to your point, I've been a soundtrack for a couple of different generations. Mm. Now not only within the business, but also the fans watching at home. And I think that people are beginning to understand now that, yeah, you know what, you don't have to call every single move in a wrestling match. You make sure you call the big spots the the big moments. But it's more important for me to explain to our audience who you guys are. And especially with Netflix, we have so many new viewers that are tuning in now. And I, I hear all over the country, wherever we travel, people coming up to us and saying, I've never watched WW before. I never understood what it was. I thought it was a bunch of old men running around in tights.


Now they're understanding that it's actually a television show episodic each and every week. And so one of my jobs now, which I love, is being able to educate this new audience on who you guys are. Like who's Logan Paul? You know, who's, who's John Cena? Who's Roman Reigns. Yep. But do that in a way where, where we're not insulting the old school fans. Yep. Who, Who Oh, understand all that. Exactly. You're the mor, you're the Morgan Freeman Shawshank of Shawshank Cred Redemption. That is WW Yes. You're telling everybody about Andy's life. Exactly's What? It's, and that's, that's partially why I appreciate what you do so much because I try to speak to the people who are getting, You know, absorbed into this universe as well.


I'm not, I'm not always like, I'm appealing to the, to the current fans. I'm trying to, I'm trying to bring people in and show them why we're special. But you mentioned it, your work ethic, your work ethic is crazy. 28 years, you've only missed three shows. Three shows, Yep. Three television shows that I was assigned to, that I was assigned to. One was, my wife had a kidney transplant back in 2001. You get a pass. Yes. The second one, my son, were You kind of mad? Were you kind of mad at her for it happening on the time around the show? So there, there's an interesting story about this, but You, dude, you couldn't have waited. Like There's a, but there was, there's an interesting story about this though. Her brother-in-law was the one who was going to give the kidney so amazing since he was a living donor.


We could play around with the schedule. She was actually supposed to receive her kidney transplant on. And we lived in New Jersey at the time on September 11th, 2001. What? And she, we were actually in the hospital that morning. Oh God. When everything happened and they hadn't begun the procedure yet. So they shut everything down. 'cause obviously all the hospitals in the New York City area had to become a trauma center. Right. So it, her transplant was put off for three weeks. Oh my gosh. They rescheduled it for a Monday, which happened to be, could you Imagine that happening like on a morning where you already have so much anxiety about what's about to happen and then that happens. It, it was, we, and we were in, You know, obviously we were in the hospital, we were in the prep room, whatever.


And we had no idea what was going on. And the it, the place, the, the hospital just, it was utter complete panic. People were going and we were like, what the heck is going on? Not, can I have your procedure today? There's a major accident in New York. And then we of course go outside. The TVs are in the lobby. This stuff is going on. And it was, it was surreal. Okay. So that's crazy. That's one. That's fine. You get a pass. Second one was my, my son, my, my son's wedding. Another pass. And Then the third one was, we actually took a family trip last year for the first time. We were able to get everybody together. I didn't know about that last one. My, my kids are older now. This is so excuse. I've got grandkids. So I took a family trip. So I actually got that off. But they were the three, the three, the three I missed.


Okay. How do you maintain the family environment and all the love if you're traveling every single week for three years. That's why I've been married 30 years. Yeah. So I started, I went to Syracuse University and I started actually in news in radio. I was a radio news journalist. And that back in the late eighties and the early nineties, radio news was like, that was the thing. Yeah. If you wanted to be a journalist, that's where you went. I mean, I traveled The world for CBS and it was so great. But I met my wife at the time. She was a sales person at the station I was working at in Houston. And that's where I met her. So Yolanda's only known me as being a person that is on the road.


Mm. So we've never had that. We got married, we were together seven days a week, and then all of a sudden I'm flying around The world. Okay. She's never known that. She's always understood me as being a person that travels. And she knows I enjoy it. I also tell people, I think I've been married so long and been with her for so long because, You know, and you know, you travel a lot, a lot, Logan, when you are home and tho those are very precious times and very precious days to be. And you don't want to argue and fight with your wife when you're at home. Yeah. Because then what are you gonna do? You go on the road for five days and now you're miserable again. So I think that's one of the reasons. And we have great lives. You know, I get on the road, I get to hang out with my buddies. She's at home, she hangs out with her girlfriends. And then when we're together, it's me and her. So, I mean, obviously that's perfect. Yeah. Yeah. When we're home, like we don't wanna fight with our partners.


Exactly. But yeah, no, it's inevitable. I feel like, I mean, sometimes it depends. Listen, the older you get, Is it not to not fight with You? Not anymore saying not anymore. How long did that Happen for? I think just outta curiosity. If someone was in a metaphorical relationship when there was fighting, Maybe. I think, You know, I, the first few years I think in a marriage were always rough. I know my, my kids have gone through that too. They're both married. But I think as the, as the years move along and you understand that hopefully not, this isn't for everyone, but like she's my best friend. Yeah. She's my life partner. I knew that the day that I met her. And I think that as you get older, you just don't wanna waste valuable time arguing over silly shit. Most arguments are silly, stupid.


Is there an age? Is there an age gap? My wife is four and a half years older than me. You know? Oh, four and a half. So it's not that big. No, not at all. Because that's funny you say like, as you get older, that's why if you date like someone that's younger than you, they sometimes will still wanna argue. 'cause they're not older. Right. They're not, You know, they don't understand that. You know, and, and the thing with, with me and Yli is we, we had kids at a very young age. We were in our early twenties when we had our children. So we were empty, nested by the time we were 40. And that gave us a lot of time together. She could travel on the road with me, go to different shows and stuff. And you know, she's not a wrestling fan, but she likes to go to the cities. And then now we have grandkids. Right. So we have a, I've got a little three year-old grandson that, that runs around, which is unbelievable.


I love it. But you know, she understands too. Like, we live in Texas, love San Antonio. Yeah. Got a nice ranch out in west Texas and we get to spend a lot of time there, which is really cool. But, You know, for us, You know, I had a very long conversation with her. A couple. I just signed a brand new contract with the company. So I'm gonna be here for a number of years. Wow. Cool. Bing. Yeah. And I mean, but, but the company really made me feel, You know, really for the first time that I was really important to this place. What, what, after 28 years? Yeah. After 28 years. Sometimes. Sometimes because the paycheck, oh, the paycheck's part of it. But the, the, the new, the new regime had a lot to do with it. Mm. But when I, when I, when I went, went to sign the New Deal, I want, I sat down with my wife and, you know, I'm 58 years old now, and I'm like, they want to get me to retirement age and is this, 'cause we had talked about me getting out of this for a long while now just because of the travel and everything else.


And, and she was like, you gotta do it. This is your legacy. Like, yeah, you're gonna be miserable if you don't finish this up the way you want to finish. See, that's a wife. And she was great about it. So she was 100% on board with it. And so I'm here for a while. Hey, congratulations. Thank you. I appreciate it. On that note, yo, What, What are they doing to my guy Corey Graves? That's, that's a strange situation. I love Corey. Me too. Love him to death. He, I still don't understand all the dynamics of it. I know that he sent something out on social media. Yeah. That was pretty critical of the company. You know, he tried to explain to everyone that he was trying to generate some interest in maybe a type of a storyline.


I don't think the company saw, I don't think the company saw it, that it was not a work. Right. It was a shoot. Yes. Allegedly man. Allegedly man. So, and again, I think he's, I think him and the company are working that out. I love Corey to death. He's an unbelievable commentator beside McAfee. He's probably best partner I've ever had. Dude, you, you guys are like such a good duo to me. And I, and I personally love Corey as well. Yeah. He's a great person. But I also think his work is fantastic. Yeah. I I I seriously have like a very special spot in my heart for commentators. 'cause like I, the work you guys do, even just Michael, you're, you're there all day. Yeah. Yeah. All Day. You have to be, especially Even an not in the, an announcing the pre-show matches And Well, and look at like Logan, look at the Rumble this weekend.


I mean, we had, there was 60 people involved in two rumble matches. Then you had a, a tag team match and a championship match. I have to be able to put together the numbers and the statistics and the stories of everyone. Dude, it's insane to make it different. And I think one of the things about the old regime, and listen, I will never ever disparage Vince McMahon. Yeah. He's got his personal issues and whatnot. But from a professional standpoint, I'll never disparage the man. I would not be here today without Vince. Like he gave no, no one would. He gave me everything stuck with me. What I was learning to be a wrestling guy. Wasn't a wrestling guy when I came here. Why do you think he believed in you so much?


I think a lot of it really had a, I think there were two things. You know, Jim Ross obviously was the man I still think the greatest ever. I think Vince was ready to understood that JR was getting older and he needed to bring in somebody younger. And so I just think because of my background and I was a good announcer at the time, I just think he Jr. Had came to the WE already a wrestling guy. And I think me being new and fresh and not a wrestling guy, Vince was able to mold me how he wanted me to be an announcer. Interesting. And he stuck with it. And even when I stuck in the beginning and everything else, and the fans freaking hated me, Vince stuck with me.


That's, that's like, that's kind of interesting though, because Vince is pretty cutthroat. Yes. That's, that's why it, I talk to Michael Hayes about this all the time. It, it's amazing that I've lasted in this company this long. Yeah. 'cause Vince, there are certain things that would set that man off. Right. And he would just go, he would just like, okay, you're done fired. See you. Yeah. Like for sometimes for no reason. Yeah. But he stuck with me 100% at the time. And so I'll never disparage the man. But Vince was very, you know, very heavy handed, controlled. It was his company, his sandbox to whatever you want. So I never was really able to break out and be myself with the exception of a little bit of a heel run I had, You know, over a decade ago. But with, when, when, when Vince left and, and Paul came and, and, and, and was in charge triple H, he really changed things.


And then we brought in Lee fitting who came from ESPN. Yep. Yep. And those Lee coming from ESPN where the talent is the announcer, he came here and said, I don't understand why our guys at the desk aren't, You know, bigger and have bigger personas and are as respected as, as the people in the ring. And, You know, being old school, I understand that you guys in the ring and the girls in the ring, they're the ones putting their bodies on the line each and every week. And people are buying tickets to see Roman reins. They're not buying tickets to see Michael Cole. But as you said earlier, we're a very important part of the product. Super. What Lee and Paul have allowed us to do is bring our personalities out and You know, you're seeing the real Michael Cole now, the, the Michael Cole that crowd serves e Exactly.


The guy who crowd surfs. We'll talk about that in a second. But, but you know, you're seeing I'm a sarcastic prick at times and I like to have fun and like Pat called me the other day, you know, I'm the old white dude, right? And, and, and he's the young who hell is he, he's the young punk, right? Well, he's a young white dude. Yeah. Young, young white dude. Yeah, I Guess. But, and, but Pat like working with him is unbelievable because Pat, we were talking about this before we got in here today. Pat is Pat, he, he doesn't change. He, he doesn't put on a show or anything? No, no. He's Pat McAfee in everything that he does. So, You know, we hit it off. We had to just hit it off from the beginning. And it's like two guys sitting at a bar and watching wrestling.


That's what it is. You know, that's cool. And that's such a vibe. That's what it is. And Pat doesn't try to be a wrestling announcer, You know, and I, I think that's what makes him different. I actually have some, a note on that at the top. You were just talking about with every passing day and second passing at the sands of, I feel the wrenching feeling of existential. This is, what the hell are you doing? This is for my therapist. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. That was the wrong note. I'm so sorry. Leslie. I, I'll, I will be at the meeting on Tuesday. Pat McAfee described your pants as too tight while you were crowd surfing the other day. Yeah. Called you a booze bag and a doofus. Yeah. He's, do you have a, do you have a response from That? Yeah, he's right on every single take on that.


I am a booze bag. Just like you guys. I was out last night till two 30 in the morning. Hey, come on. Yeah. No, but the crowd surfing thing was wild. Like I saw That. I like This. Would've never hap that would've never happened under Vince McMahon. Really? Michael Cole eating on a table would never happened. Trying to dap up rappers would've never happened under Vince McMahon. But the crowd surfing thing, Cody comes out and he's like, okay, we gotta do this thing. And I'm like, do what? Oh God, here we go. What are we gonna, what's gonna happen now? And then he says, you're gonna, You know, you're gonna crowd surf. I'm like, crowd surf, you're gonna be kidding me. So then he goes, it's easy. Look at, and he, I, we look down, it's a six foot drop. And like, I'm not jumping down there. I'm 50 years old, kill myself. So I actually follow my ass, look like a dummy.


And then I get into the crowd and I'm doing the whole thing and I'm getting my junk grabbed and people stick there Grabbing your Cheeks. Good thing I moved my wallet to my, my sport jacket. But I've never done, I'd never done it before in my life. And But you did. Now you did it. Yes. But even, even as a kid, I'd never done it. Right. That was your first concert first. So I find out afterward, Cody's explained to me, well, I should have showed, told you how to do this. You gotta keep your legs closed. You gotta be rigid. And like I was flip flopping all over the place, like Gumby or whatever. We probably trusted the fact that as a bunch of like dudes in the audience, they weren't gonna Be crap. Yeah. But if some of those people don't like me. Right. So, but that was wild. That was the first time I'd done it. But again, I, I would've never like the whole social media thing, I, it, you know, I I never, I'm finally starting to understand it now.


Like, I appreciate so much, like what you've accomplished and what Pat's accomplished and all these guys, You know, I show speed, of course it was in the Rumble. Like I never understood any of that stuff. But I am beginning to understand it now. And Now I find myself, You know, actually going to X and, and going to Instagram and, and being entertained and understanding that this is the way of The world now. Damn. And also understand and McAfee was very important and helping me understand all this stuff. Interesting. But now, like, doing silly shit. Like I don't tweet much, but me and Pat will get together on a Monday and put out a controversial tweet or something and then I just like to sit there and watch all the responses to it or whatever. But, but just seeing like that sounds like awesome. Yeah. Just seeing how exciting it is though. Like, You know, getting on a table last night with Wade and Pat and just eating and getting her ring and eating with Jay and looking like a bird flopping my wings.


But then going on looking at social media and just saying, oh my God, this is pretty cool. People actually like this or they hate it, but it doesn't matter. Right. People are talking about it. And to me that's, that's really cool. But again, I'm having the most fun I've ever had in my career. Amazing. We can tell, We can tell bro. You're like lighting up talking about this stuff and, and it's so cool that you have this new contract and it sounds like it's probably gonna be the most exciting, like most you part of your career, which Is sick. Netflix was also a big part of this. I I really, the cool thing I I've been able to be a part of, of a lot of changes in our, in our company over the years. First time we did Network TV on UPNI was there, spike TV back in the day. Oh God. Of course. SA network.


I was the, the guy on Fox, which was really important to me. 'cause I really wanted to be able to, to call a network television show. And then the Netflix thing was like, I have to be a part of that. Like, that was, yeah. Cool. You know what a what a game changer for everything. Super cool. Yeah. Super cool. It's like, it's, it's, it's the, it's the new forefront of like, you know, live TV meets a streaming network and we're at the front of it. Yep. I wanted to ask, 'cause you were talking about the chemistry that you and Pat have, how important Is it to have chemistry with the person that you're commentating with? Have to you, you, you cannot do your job. I've been blessed with being able to get along with most of my broadcast partners over the years. And I've worked with so many of 'em.


Yeah. I've always gotten along with everyone. They've respected my work. I, I understand their work. But with Pat it's different. Pat and I are really good friends. So Pat was a, you know, he's always a wrestling fan. Yep. His whole life. He came to one of our house shows in Indiana a number of years ago. Yep. And we just started talking and he's like, I'd like to try this. And I'm like, well, what, You know, he was at Bars stool at the time. Yep. And we're like, why don't you come in and start doing some stuff with an xt? And he came in and he started doing the, the countdown shows and all that. And me and him got really, really close. And then our relationship imploded for a night because at WrestleMania a number of years ago, I, so I'm no longer in charge of the announcers.


I used to not only be an announcer, but I was in charge of all the announcers. Okay. So I was a VP in the company doing all that. And so we brought Pat in to do the WrestleMania kickoff show. And You know, everybody at WrestleMania is tuxes and ties and the whole nine yards. And Pat shows up in shorts. Yeah. Now they were tuxedo shorts, but he shows up in shorts. So now we're about to go on the air live. It's all this pressure. I see Pat walk into the gorilla with these shorts on and I'm like in front of everybody, which is my bad, what the fuck are you doing? Oh man, dude, you're in fucking shorts. It's man, it's WrestleMania. Oh man. Stephanie McMahon's there, Vince's there. All these people that I'm, I'm dressing down pat you little Brodo.


I did, did. And I, you know, in heat of the moment, I didn't think about it. Then I, then he stormed off and I'm like, where the fuck are you going? I'm not doing the show. He goes back, he's packing his back in, in the locker room to leave. Oh shit. He goes, you just embarrassed me in front of everybody in this company for, I'm like, and I never thought of it that way, but he was right. Now What Do you mean it's just Called out and wearing shorts? Yeah. But well that's, that's more of a result of the, of the fact that you had like this hybrid talent, talent management and call. And that sucks role. It did it. And that's why you had to get rid of that. Exactly. I've, I ironically, I've worked in that situation before too, when I was doing shit with Maverick and you would tell me to go fucking scold people. It's, it's, it's hard. 'cause these guys are your peers, right? Yeah. Yeah. And you're working on the air with 'em then you're also managing 'em.


Thank God I Got outta that. But yeah. But then Pat, you know, he is gonna pack his bags and leave and we ended up working it out. We showed Vince the shorts and Vince was of course Vince, it was great. What, why are you yelling at him? Because he just like, The exact opposite Thought was shit. Right. So, yeah. So it's, it's wild man. And then, and ever since then, I think that brought us closer together and we've been best friends since. That's so cool. I'm doing a show this week, You know, before we go up to raw and it's just, it's cool. But it comes out on air. Like you can tell, like you guys are buds. Right. And it, it's just this great chemistry that you all have. Pat and I are friends, we talk all the time. Yeah. And it just comes out. Is is there, so when I, when I first started, like really paying attention to the dynamics that were happening, but in the ring and in the commentary table, it, it seemed like there was like a heel announcer and a baby face announcer.


Yep. That Was always the formula. Yeah. It with you and Pat. Is it, is that existent? So it, it, it, it's, it, this is by design. We have two completely separate sounding announced teams. Now for the first time in a very long time, everybody, once Vince molded Michael Cole over the years, every person we brought into this company since then, Vince wanted to be Michael Cole. And that is why a lot of these guys who are great broadcasters were never successful. Okay. 'cause they couldn't be me and Vince wanted them to be me. Hmm. What Leaf fitting and Paul have done now, and Nick Kahn is we've developed two completely different announced teams now. So now on Fridays you have Joe Tessit who's a, a, a pro.


Yeah. He's great. Unbelievable. But he's, he's not me. He's completely different than me. He's more of a professional broadcaster. Yeah. And he doesn't hype jump up and down and act like an idiot sometimes and scream and yell. Like, I scream, I'm a screamer that way for 28 years, nobody ever changed me. Joe's more relaxed. And then he is got Wade Barrett, who's great and Wade's a heal. Right? Yep. Pat and I are different. They wanted us to be different. Like I said before, we're just two guys sitting on a couch drinking a beer, watching the show. Yeah. That's what it sounds like. And I don't think, yeah, the heel dynamic's fun. Right. But I don't, I think our fans are, are so sophisticated. Now this isn't your, are you Sure about that?


Yes, very much so. Just 'cause I wa sometimes I walk and I like when I'm walking down the aisle and I'm looking out and sophistication is the last word that comes to mind. I, I really, when I see these people, like, Trust me, Michael, I look them in the eyes and like, sometimes I'm just like, I'm like, whoa, there's nothing going on. Well, He's doing his, he's doing his heel thing. Yeah, of Course. No, I'm serious. But there, but there are those like that. But I mean, our audience is so different now than it was, It's harder for us, it's harder for us to do it because we're not the heel. So we Exactly. He's like, he's like, shit, what do I do here? I I don't wanna bear the audience, but Yeah. When I was a heel, I love to bear, bear the audience. But no, I, I really do think though Logan, seriously, that our audience is a lot more sophisticated now than they were before.


We don't have to shove things down their throats now they get It. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. You know, I don't have to, You know, explain every single thing of everything. Oh my God, I think he's a bad guy now. No. Let the fans figure that out. So I wanted to ask about that. This is the thing I'm most curious about. How much of the storytelling are you keyed in ahead of time or calling on the spot? Because you're, you're following it and kind of crafting it yourself. Like are, are, are producers in your ear telling you like little, little spots to look out for? Like what's, what's the actual art of crafting the things that you're saying? So no one's in my air anymore. Vince was a lot. But again, it was his world. You know what he, What, what would he say?


Hey, Hey, what the fuck Was that man? He would say anything like, give me great advice or call me a fucking moron. Or seriously. I mean, there, it just, whatever Moody was in whatever I did, most of it was constructive criticism. It really was. I mean, there were days where Vince would just be Vince, but, You know, I think this whole Vince screamed at Michael Cole for 25 years. Thing is way overblown. I mean, there are moments, but it's gonna happen in a relationship for that long. Yeah. But to your point, You know, first off, pat McAfee knows nothing. Pat doesn't wanna know anything. He doesn't want to know anything that's going on in the show. He wants to go out there and just be him and Be intentionally He's, he's like you and our Pokemon box breaks amazing, Amazing.


A lot, a lot of this. The question asking that's coming outta him right now and would be for me as well, is like, we can relate to this. Yeah. Like, so like someone's level preparation, a lot of times, like depending on the episode, he'll come super prepared. I'll, I'll purposely intentionally not even look at the pdf. Yep. I want to come into this the same way the audience is. I wanna figure this person out as I sit there. That's why like, this whole conversation is super interesting to us. Yeah. And that's, and and, and, and that's, pat doesn't wanna know anything. Yeah. Which makes him Pat. Yeah. Yeah. I need to be prepared because I, I don't know every single step of every single thing that's going to happen. Mm. But I need to understand storylines. I need to understand where we're gonna go with certain characters so I can sort of lead the audience in that direction.


'cause I am the narrator. Right. So you wanna make sure that you're leading the audience a certain way. You're, you're The ba you're the baseline and you're gonna keep that DNA and that through line of the story going. Yep. And Pat is the the action points. Yep. Exactly. And then like for instance at at the Rumble, I'll, I'll sit at ringside all day, like Logan said, and the guys and girls will come up and talk to me. And like Gargano and Champa, the tag Champs, DIY came up to me and they explained their whole outlay of their match because there was some certain little things that I had to know about to be able to bring forward in the story and explain why these things were happening. And also at the end, street prophets got involved and people were like, why are they getting involved? So I needed to have that knowledge to explain to the audience why this is happening. That's what I'm talking about.


So those are the things. Okay. Yeah. 'cause 'cause we've, we've done stuff Yeah. Like that before with you. Yeah. Even, even, You know, the, the right hand, the titanium rod and, and, and you've, you've reinforced that Knuckles. Yeah. Yeah. I remember talking to you before the Roman match. 'cause that was the biggest match of your career to that point. Yeah. Yeah. And I remember talking to you guys about that match Yeah. And just little storyline things that I had to get in to help you. So it was, yeah, I mean that stuff's really, really important. 'cause again, our job first and foremost is to enhance our talent and the, the better our talent get from a story standpoint and the, the more emotionally invested our fans get in our talent, obviously we sell more tickets Yeah. The more people watch the show. Yep. So, Okay. When you made the, when you made the jump from radio to wwe, like, and you weren't a massive wrestling fan.


I was as a kid, but Yeah, Same. Right? Yeah. How and why? So it's, it's a sort of a long story, but I'll, I'll, I need it to explain how this happened. So I was in radio news in, in Texas, traveling all the time m much more than I do now. And my, we, we were young and into our marriage and, and my, I Got transferred to New York Okay. To work for CBS in New York. And they promised me that you're just gonna work outta the city. So I'll be home all the time. And well, I Got there and I ended up in 96 going out and covering the, I had covered Bill Clinton's campaign in 92, 96. I had covered Bob Dole's campaign and what a joke. Well, I want, I want to talk about this. After The presidential, I was out, I was out that entire year.


96. Yeah. And my wife was like, what the hell are you doing? First of off, if you moved my ass from Texas to New York, and now you're not even home. She's on the campaign trail. So Todd Pettengill, I'm not sure if you guys are familiar, Todd Pettengill used to work in our company, but he was a, a huge radio DJ in New York at WPLJ, which was a powerhouse at the time in the nineties. And I had worked with Paul, with, with Todd for a while on radio. He was working here and he was gonna leave the company. He said, Hey, come in for an audition. So I came in and, and did an audition and didn't hear for a few months, but then they said, you wanna come work here? So I figured, listen, I'm in radio Now, I have no television experience. Let me go try this job for a couple of years, get some TV experience, get a tape under my belt, and I'll leave and go back and work at CNN or somewhere.


Yeah. Well, 28 years later I'm still here. So Yeah. It just turned into a love, just this whole business. But, but, but, But by this point, you, You know, the moves you, you, you, You're very new. Yeah. I don't even call em half the time though. It's just, you don't have to. Yeah. You know? Yeah. It's just, you don't, you know, it's the drama. You know, I sometimes you, you, you, you talk to hardcore fans and they get all hung up on, oh, he didn't call out a Canadian destroyer. He didn't know the name of the move. Who gives a shit. Yeah. Seriously. It, it, it, it's, it's the story. That's what people care About. Do You know why I relate to this? It feels like karate combat. Really? A hundred percent. Oh, I, I, I commentate a, a real, like a really up and big up and coming karate pick based karate league and like walking into this and being brought on because the energy and bravado and comedy because they wanted and, and social media.


Yeah. You know, pull as well to sit there next to GSP and Boss Rutin Yep. And talk about Love Boss. Insane. Yep. Like legends of the game. Right. And to talk about, You know, jiujitsu and grappling and all this stuff. And I'm sitting there like, were there, were there moments where you were like, ah, I can't do this. Like In the very dude, I didn't know. So the funny thing about it is when I started this company in 97, WCW starts kicking our ass. Yeah. Yep. Yep. And then the screw job happens in Montreal with Brett Hart and Vince and, and Shawn Michaels and I go home and, and My wife's like, what Are you doing? Your company is about you. You just Left a what whatcha you doing with your life? You just left a lucrative job at CBS to go to this circus.


You've been here six months and now all of a sudden the company's gonna go outta business. Yeah. Because we thought we were gonna go business. Yeah. Yeah. It was wild. The what what, what saved me in this business in the beginning was when I first started, our producer at the time, Kevin Dunn said, You know nothing about wrestling, but we think you're a good broadcaster. You need to learn the business. So they sent me out on the road every single weekend to our live events, which we were running every weekend at the time. Yeah. And I rode with JBL, John Bradshaw, Layfield, the old cowboy, who, one of my really good friends, he taught me the business in the car. My job was to make sure that there was beer and whiskey in the car after every show so I could drive them to the next town. But that's how I learned.


Right. And I spent a year with these guys and excuse me, that's how I learned the business. And then of course with Michael Hayes and Paul Hamman and guys like that. But yeah, there were times where I was like, I made a huge, huge mistake here. Like I have no idea what I'm doing. And then Jim Ross ended up getting sick in 1998 and they threw me out there for four or five months on the main shows. And I really was, I had, I was green. I was like, this is wild. Like I have, I'm not gonna, I better start looking for another, another job. Like whoa. Yeah. And you're trying to, and you're also at the same time, like who, who are you commentating with at the, or announcing with at the time? The Jerry King. Jerry the King Lawler at that Time. Yeah. Come on dude. I mean, and you're, and you're, Well actually be at WrestleMania, But, but you're, you're going out there and it's like, you're trying to, not only are you trying to announce for the first big shows yourself, but you have to learn the synergy like this immediately.


And that that's one of the hardest things. Yeah. I mean this, this whole thing took, You know, at least 60, 70 episodes to get to a point where it was like a semi honed and now it's a, a, a product. Right. Yep. But like, that must've been very hard to do in real time on Yeah. Main broadcast. And especially when it comes to, to, to wrestling. Because as You know, our fans are, they are the hardest, they're the most loyal. They're also the hardest fans in The world. Yeah. Judgemental. Yeah. I mean, it's, it was hard. And, You know, thank God, I always tell people this, thank God that back in the late nineties, there was no social media because I don't know if I'd be here today if there was social media.


What do you mean by that? Well, just the way that, You know, everyone has a voice and You know, I, I know at, I know at the time, 99% of The world would've hated Michael Cole and I probably wouldn't have made it. Yeah. So, but yeah, it was, it was a wild time. Well do, do you feel like that, because one thing I've noticed, You know, having been around the business a little bit with him is the, the hatred is, is an equal value currency is love in this, in this org. Right. And so it's like, it's it's an attention, a currency of attention. And so e even if they were all day, we fucking hate this. Does it, does it change when it comes to the commentary crew? There, there, there's two types of heat. There's the heat you're talking about, which is the Logan Paul heat when he walks out and people boo him.


Yeah. And it's not because they hate Logan, it's just because he plays this character that people don't like. It's not a character. Well, I know I was trying to be nice, but, but, but then there's, then, then there is what they, they call go away heat. Oh, they consider a bad product. Yes. They just consider it's a bad character. It's a bad product. It's a bad person on the air. We had some announcers recently that just didn't work out because, and you would, you could go online and, You know, 99% of the people hated him. And You know, at that point, like, you feel inside yourself, like, this guy's not gonna make it. And then when you realize and you listen to some of that, you know, he is not gonna make it. You know? Yeah. I, I think I have go away heat.


You think so The only reason why it works is 'cause I'm a great wrestler. You are. I'm, I'm not. I'm, I'm not. I'm not. No. You like, I, that's why you don't, you don't have go. No, that's what you're saying. Is it not like, like certainly there's a handful of the audience that is genuinely like, get this guy outta here because They're Jealous. Yeah. That's different. You, you, you, you No, they are seriously, they're, they're jealous of you. I get that a lot too. That's what Pam said. You Know? I know. That's why I was like, my mom Said the same. But Logan, they're jealous of you. I mean, look what you've accomplished since you've come to Wwb, not only here, I mean, look at what you accomplished in your life. But I mean, it's the same thing for us. Like, people sitting at home watching a show, well, oh my god, Michael Cole sucks. He didn't know the name of that move.


Or this or that. I would, first off, they're mad. They don't have my job. Second off, put them in that chair. Sit in that chair. No, no, Dude, your, your job is fucking crazy, Michael. Yeah. I'm not kidding. But people don't get it. I know, I get it. Which is why I have so much respect for you and the commentating team. I would rather do what I do than have to do what you do, dude. How do you talk so much and not get tired? I'm Surprised I have a voice today. 'cause I blew it last night. Seriously. You know, I, I get tired. I don't get me, especially as I get older, you know, and I really have to take care of myself Now I, I, I eat right. I, You know, I still like my whiskey, but workout and seriously at my age, You know, my wife's always like, why are you going the gym again?


I go every day because it's not because I want to. Well, obviously you gotta look halfway decent when you're in television, right? Yeah. But as you get older, You know, your body starts to break down. Yeah. And this job is very taxing both mentally and physically. Yeah. And people don't understand the physical things of it. You know, three and a half hours jumping up and down, screaming, yelling, ah, You know, it's, it's, it's, it's hard. So you gotta try to stay in shape for that, which as I get older, I realize I need to do that. But our, our vocal cords that way. Sorry. It's because you're thinking about it. It's because you're thinking about it. Our Vocal cords are muscles and just like anything else, I utilize those muscles at a very high level every week.


Oh, I get it. And it has now these muscles are in, they're in, they're in shape now. Right. And so there's, it's funny seeing broadcasters come into our business for the first time from other realms and try to do what we do. Yeah. It takes them a long time. Yeah. Yeah. I remember one of our announcers, Kevin Patrick, Kevin Egan, he works with MLS now, but he, he had, he had a terrible time, like with his voice, like his first few months here. He could not, he, he wasn't in shape to do this. Dude. Not even just the, the amount of talking you have to be on that's like, we could, I could probably do this podcast audio and have like, we could, we, we've done three in a row. Maybe some day is like four in a row and it's all right.


But live TV having to be on is like, that's the real drain for me. There's no net right? No, it is live. And you gotta, and and especially in this day and age, you gotta be very, very careful what you say. Obviously, you know, especially on, on, You know, even with Netflix, like we thought we were gonna be able to get away with a few other things. But Netflix is very strict with that too. I, I heard this. Yeah. People told me they're actually a little more So guys like us that are talking live, especially working with Pat who's got, You know, he's got no buffer. He's just Pat. You gotta be really careful sometimes what you say. Especially, and that's another reason, and Pat keeps me young too. I've gotta keep up to date with the phrases the kids use today and stuff like that. And make sure, Try to make sure you have the right aura. Well, yeah.


Well also make sure that I'm not, I'm not saying stuff that Is an LT Exactly. Has changed into a different, and also one thing I've noticed too, and maybe you noticed it, is like for some of the longer stuff, like some of these events that I do with Karate Combat are like six, seven hours long. Right? By hour four or five, that, that barrier of like should I say this or not say this starts to kinda like melt away a little bit. 'cause you Get a headache, bro. You're losing, you're starting to become mush. Yeah. And all of a sudden things are coming outta your mouth. They're like, wait a second, did I say that? Am I here? What's that? Like? What's going on? And the problem with our stuff, to your point, Logan too, is it's not just, it's not just being on, because it's live television.


Every single match in character have to be given the same respect and gravity. Yeah. So I can't treat Logan Paul any differently than I treat Ludwig Kaiser. Yeah. Or I can't treat Roman rain. So like at the rumble, I've gotta be high energy for every woman's entrance. Yeah. For 30. And then obviously as you get close to the finish and the big moves and putting everybody over, then you've gotta be able to treat the tag team match with, with, with new group Motor City machine guns at the same level you would treat the women at. 'cause you don't wanna feel like you're, you're disrespecting them. Then you go into the Cody match, which is just an intense ladder match. Right. You gotta, that's a championship match. So you gotta be up here. And then of course the Rumble, men's Rumble, which is biggest event of the year last.


So You're like saving up energy. Well, It's hard because you gotta keep that energy level the whole way. And then now you got 30 men entering. And last night, You know, you were in there that last six in that it was, I had goosebumps in. Oh, it was insane. You had Hall of Famers in there. Did you think about that at all? Yeah. I'm getting goosebumps Now. I It was, I mean, you're in there with guys, John Cena, Seth Rollins, punk. Punk, Roman Rains. J Uo. No, that was insane. Insane. You, I, I, I looked around, I was looking at these guys and I was just like, damn, I'm right at home. Right. No, I know. And but, but you but you Felt it. I was like, I, You know, You know damn well, deep down inside you were going, how the hell am I even here? Not at All. Not at all. Not at all. I was, I was like, I honestly was like, how the hell is C punk still Here?


But I, I was the original yeet by the way. You were. Yeah, that is true. Yes. When did, when did This happened? Yee? Yeah. Years Ago. Years ago. Years. Oh man, I, in fact, I thought we had put that in a bulletproof coff in, so I thought that was dumb. So, so did Jay Steal it from you? Yes. And I'm, and I'm sending him a season desist. I'm actually sending him a season desist. Oh my God. Not a work. He will be getting a season desist. And I'm, I'm collecting everything. Everything. Well now he's the main inventor, so. Yeah. That's true. That's true. Let's talk about, like, let's talk about the, the other commentators in, in, in big sports, even under the TKO umbrella. The UFC. Yeah. When you look at guys like Joe Rogan, John Annick, even Daniel Cormier.


Yeah. Bruce Buffer. Yeah. It's funny, he, he came on this podcast and he was saying the same thing about how he, how he works out and he's got stay in shape. 'cause I mean, Bruce goes hard. Yeah. When you look at guys like this, are you are, are you, Is it, do you kind of see eye to eye and Is it like, Is it, Is it like a respect that only like a commentator can understand? There is a respect. And one of the things that was really cool is when Joe Tessit to came aboard. Joe is a boxing guy, right? Yeah. And I've learned a lot from Joe about combat sports. And when Joe came aboard to me, You know, a lot of people were like, a lot of people love to hire, a lot of people didn't like to hire. But to me, I loved it because I felt like it finally legitimized Yes.


What I've done for 28 years. We brought a, a real true life legendary commentator. Yeah. He's called Monday Night Football and college football and everything else. He wanted to work here. Yeah. He came to us to work here and we brought him aboard. And that to me legitimized everything I did. So cool. And I think there is that, You know, I love Joe Rogan. I, I mean, his stuff is, he's a, he's a screamer yeller, emotionally, he's like me, right? Yeah. Yeah. And I just think a, across the board, we commentators are this fraternity because for so many years we didn't get the respect I think that we deserve. But now in this new era of the, not only in wrestling, but just in life and in The world, we're finally getting respect and we're becoming personalities, You Know?


You know, I think, I think social media is part of the reason for that. You know what, I'm s like you, you can build your personal brand and, and you, you, you have an entrance now. Yeah. It's, it's, it's some, it's usually, and people Actually cheer. Yeah. They Cheer, they always cheer before the show starts. Or, or You know, there's little like pre-show we did one at the hq, man, they love you 'cause you're building your personal brand and then you just get to like, people just get to listen to you. You're, you're doing podcasts back to back, to back to back to back every week. And I think too, You know, Logan, the thing about that is the big thing for me is I'm, they're, I'm finally myself. Like, I, I think people looked at me as a corporate sto right. For Vince McMahon for so many years. And, and I really was a Vince puppet. You know, I'll admit that.


And I'll never, I would never, ever trade that for anything because I learned so much under the, the man from a professional standpoint. But I think in the, in the last few years since Pat came aboard, You know, I, I've, I've just decided fuck it, I'm myself. I'm, I'm my, You know, I'm gonna be Sean thar my real name. Right. I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be that, I'm gonna be the person that my friends know the people that when I go have a drink at a bar, the guy who's sarcastic and laughs and has fun and loves this business. 'cause I really do everything that's given to me in my life. But it's fun. Right? I wasn't, I wasn't, I wasn't sure aware of how, how like down to earth you were. Oh, thanks. Yeah. Yeah. And, and Am I usually a prick? We we never really know what to think of, You know?


No, I, I, I don't know mean bro. Like, you literally are like the voice of the WWE for generations for 28 years. And so like, I don't fucking know you, in my opinion. You have every right to be like, Fuck off dude. That's Not people's default. You always No, I just, I don't, we We live in Hollywood. You live in Hollywood. But I don I still do. We meet some, yeah. We meet some shitty people. Yeah. But the major, but the majority of people are, Are pretty good. They're good. They're good. They're, they're getting better. 'cause they, 'cause they have to, they have to. But then you have the like, and I'll just say it. Oh, I hope you, is somebody getting called out? I mean, I don't know, bro. This, this, this whole like Blake Lively Ryan Reynolds situation. Oh my God. Feels Like, Oh God.


Are you filled in on it? Do You know the whole Yeah. And they just seem so fucking out of touch. Right. With like, they're just not living in reality. And like people, people lose themselves in in, in their own truth. It happens in our business. Yeah. Yeah. You see it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, people think they come into their stars and then they're gonna leave and be a star outside of here and doesn't happen. Yeah. Sorry. No. You know, we, our product makes you I'm sorry. Hundred dude. Come on. I mean, there's very few Logan Pauls that come into our world and are successful. Most people get successful here. They think they can leave. Who's, well, this is Cena Batiste and Rock. Rock. Yeah. This is one of the biggest, this is possibly the biggest example of it. Like, it Is, it is like, you like, think about it when you talk to people outside of the WWE sphere about what happened, that rumbles and speed came up.


The fuck you talking about? Man, dude, what are you talking about? Did you hear about the tariffs? What are you saying? Right now? 90% of The world don't even know what wrestling is. But but that 10% Yeah. That's, that are die hard. There's nothing like it. So I, You know, I think, you know, I, my wife is the main reason that I am the way I am. She's not a wrestling fan. Doesn't watch a product. I go home and the last thing I talk about is WWE really never, I mean, keeps you grounded. She was more excited when I told her this morning I was going to do Logan Paul's podcast. Hell yeah. Than she was about anything else. Hell yeah. And when, and, and I'm doing Pat McAfee show tomorrow. And she was more excited about me doing that than anything else. Yeah. Yeah. So, But more excited about Impulsive.


Oh, more excited Pat. A hundred percent. Yeah. Got it. Got it. But the, but she keeps me grounded. She really does. I go home and I'm with her. And, but listen, I'm a dude. I was brought up in upstate New York and I'm in Texas now. I Got a ranch and I'm an old redneck. Hell yeah. I dip tobacco. Hell, hell yeah. I I drink beer and I like my whiskey. And, and last night, You know, I, that's why I always stay away from downtown in these cities. Like, I don't want that scene. Like me and Wade Barrett went up to the, the bar last night. Yeah. What'd you guys do at Hotel? Just we sat at the bar till two 30 in the morning, just talk shit and just talked shit. We didn't even talk about wrestling. Like, just talked about life. Right. No way. Yeah. And it was great. It was, that's me. That's what I want. I'm gonna leave here today and go sit in my hotel room the rest of the day. Right. So, well, I don't know about that last part there.


Yeah. That, that, that What's what Are you gonna just gonna just sit there? Well, yeah, I'm chilling today 'cause we're going up to Cleveland tomorrow. But, but What will you do in the room? I'm just, well, I'll watch, I'm, I'm back into the Sopranos now. So Were rerunning The Irun did, you've already watched it all. Oh yeah. Watched. This is the third time I've actually Greatest series of all time y Great series of all time. Nothing touching it. The Wire Is close too. I love The Wire. Yeah. But Sopranos is nothing Now I love going back now because even 25 years later, it's still timeless. I'm rewa, I'm rewatching season two of it right now. Which by the way, is potentially the best season. I I'm a season three, season three guy. You, You really? I have to. You've never seen it earned. He's, he's a little bit older dude On it. Look, he's, You know, he's been telling me for our entire relationship.


Yeah. It's the greatest. There has Never been a bad episode. My favorite episode is Pine Barons when Of course. Well That's the most famous episode. Yeah. He's, they saying he was an interior decorator. So, great, bro. It's, it's, it's the greatest. Maybe you, the problem for a lot of watchers new viewers on it is you do have to invest a little bit in season one. Yeah. I think they, they're piloting, they're trying to get people excited about the show. They're trying new things. Like what was data character in episode one that, that went into the store when Christopher was ordering the food Comes back as a completely different character. Different character. Relate. Who was that? I can't remember who was. I can Not yet. But, but, but, but, but the, how can you not get hooked though, with Chrissy and Tony driving the car through the Plaza and running people that run that guy when beating the shit out of him. Remember how do Hooked Logan, you gotta watch, have to do it.


You Have to. He feels out. He feels out. No, I'm, I'm more interested in like, these games, You know? Yeah. Or like Severance God, dangit Severance by the Severance. Have you started the second, have you Started? No, I'm so excited. So We're, we're one episode in the second season. Holy Shit. I heard it's even more rich and potentially better than season one. Season one. I didn't know if I was gonna make it through it initially. Yeah. Like the first few episodes. Yeah. Same thing with Sopranos. Like, I was like, I don't know about this. And then, oh my God, dude, It is the, it is the only show where the last episode of season one, I felt like this perfect mix of like, fully fulfilled in terms of the questions I wanted answered and all the plot, like holes I needed to fill, but also I need more.


Yes. What is happening? And it's like, oh my God. Oh God. Wait. You see how season two starts? Ah, they waited A they waited a while to your season. Yeah. 'cause it was 'cause it was that like, you know, You Know Ben, you know Ben Stiller directed it. Yeah. Yeah. As far as, as far as like shows now, like it's comparatively to what HBO was doing on Sunday nights, You know, 15 whatever it was years ago. It's that. And then have you guys been watching Succession? Yes. You watch Successions, From what I understand is equal awesome. Like Equally equal. Unbelievable. There's, and then I just finished American Prime Evil on oh, Netflix As Violent as shit really, really, really good. Peter Berg's just awesome Character. I'm watching, I'm watching, maybe you guys haven't seen this, but I'm watching Fallout, which is based on the video game Fallout. Oh yeah.


I, yeah, I've heard that. Seen it did Better than it. Oh, were they around the same time? Yeah. Yeah. Had different products. Yeah. No, but it's still just like, I don't know. I'm proud of my boy Jimmy. My boy Jimmy. Have you watched Peace Games? No, not at all. Give It her a shot. Okay. That show is fucking sick. I Gotta tell my wife, she's my, my wife's the one who makes me sit down and watch this stuff. I'm antsy. Like I'm, she's b I'm a personality. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm always like, I'm up five in the morning with the dogs running around. But do You feel, how do you feel about that opposite situ? I mean, it works for you. Oh my God. Greatest thing ever. Yeah. Yeah. I, what I've had to learn though, as I've grown through, through my marriage is I, because I'm intense and I think it It's a lot, it's a Lot to deal with. So I think it's why I'm good at my job too. Right. But I think, You know, and she's so laid back and she's retired now, so she's just like almost asleep till 10 o'clock.


And I'm up at five with the dogs, the gym, I've learned to temper my intensity and I, that's just helped. Yeah. Yeah. I'm one of the, I'm, I'm like an OCD guy. Like, I, I have my calendar, right. And I gotta go through my calendar, make sure that everything is checked off every day.


You should get the big ass calendar. Do you have it? Oh really? No, I don't. There's a big ass calendar. There is. It's huge. It's a big ass calendar. Jesse, our boy Jesse Itzler made it. And everyone, everyone has one. You should get one, get it online. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah. We'll just get, We can probably just have him snap Out your, We send It to you. So, so like, and my wife use Logan Logan 20 for 20% off. Okay. I Got you.


Jesse. Is that actually true or Not? I Got you, Jesse, yesterday. Yes. He give you a call, But I won't like, so like I go through the calendar, she thinks I'm crazy. Like, she's like, she won't even look at her calendar, whatever. Just tell me what I gotta do. But yeah, no, I mean that's, it's just, it's, I mean that's why it works. Do you think you could commentate for the UFC if the roles were reversed? I, I don't know because I'm, You know, I don't, could I do it? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Could I be good at it? I'm not sure why. It's not storyline driven. It's not episodic television. The, the finishes aren't predetermined. It's a fight. Right. And you've gotta know all that stuff. And I think my job is much more difficult only because I have to weave in the stories and the character's development.


I'm not calling, just calling a fight. It's creative, Not Tactical. I would agree. Yeah. I would totally agree. The Real aspect of it is, You know, better than anybody is how, what the misconception of people thinking that, okay, it's rigged, it's riggs the wrong word. It's, it's scripted. The finish we know and they go through what they're going to do in the match. People misconstrue that to not think it's physical. The You athletes are the most un Listen, I had a little runback when I was a heel or actually got in the ring. Terrible, terrible what I did, but I took bumps. Right. Couldn't have been worse than mine. Well Dude, watch WrestleMania in 2011 when I had my match With Jerry. Did you? I I was in there. I did hair horrible. I Terrible. Worst, worst match ever.


But, but, but I, but I was, I Got my tooth knocked out. Two tooth, two teeth knocked. Oh, actually, yeah. See punk during the day as I was going over my match with Jerry, 'cause he's a friend of mine. He just decided to run across the ring and gimme a knee lift. Well, dummy me, didn't move outta the way, knock my tooth out. Damn. Then in the match, Jerry hit me with a drop kick, then knocked my other tooth out. Yeah. Oh God. So, but, so I understand how difficult, but like, and that's just taking some simple bumps. Like, I don't know how people that think, like, look at what Kevin Owens did last night, dude. Oh God. He came out of gorilla. I don't even know if he was like fully conscious. Dude. I this big bleeding on four sides of his, I I'm looking at Kevin. I go, my only thought was way to go, Cody.


Like, You know, fuck, fuck this guy. Fuck him up. He picked the guy up And he threw him through a table. That was insane. That, and a guy turned inside. It was, Everybody's telling me, they're like, those those are, those are blood packets, right? Surely. I'm like, I don't think so. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Think so. And then JD McDonagh on raw last week. Oh no, I thought he was dead. I really did. He, He, Michael, tell me about that. He, He came off that ring and he hit the desk so hard. It moved our desk back. I seriously thought he was dead. And then come to find out later, he had a punctured he had, and didn't he really hit his head? He had broken ribs and a punctured lung and he went on and finished the match. Another 10 minutes. Insane. So this is the craziest part about wrestling, Because didn't that happen to you? Yes. Because you got hurt into the match, right?


Yes. I pulled my MCL mid match. Like, I like, like, and I, that Was on the, On the, You know, Aria, right? No, No, no. This was in my third match against Roman. Right. I remember it. Like I'm in the main event. I gotta show up. Right. Also, like I Got Roman rains across me. God damn. It wasn't even one of the big Moves. No, no. It was, it was on some, it was on some stupid shit. Oh, okay. I I I'm much more focused on my mechanics now than I have been before. And also I'm gonna protect myself more. Yeah. 'cause like sometimes like guys are stiff than I'm really looking out for you. I haven't wrestled, I haven't wrestled with him yet. Well, Good luck. Oh my God. Good luck. Nah, but nah. So I'm, I'm gonna protect myself a little more. But if you are actually injured, you gotta not sell that you're injured unless it's part of the story.


And then if you aren't injured, you should sell. If you got hit in a certain stick, you have to do the opposite of what's true. And for a guy like JD who, You know, broke his ribs and punctured his lung, you're looking at 10 more minutes of match in your head and you're like, and He did it. How, how tough is that guy? How The fuck am I gonna do this? Right. It's gotta be all mostly adrenaline at that point. Well you mean you look at other sports, a guy, You know, what'd you do, what'd you say you did with the injury? Was I tore, I tore my NCL. Okay. So when a guy does that in the football field, he's outta the game. Outta the the game. Goodbye game. You guys have some sort of sick pride that you wanna finish these matches when you get hurt. Sad, masochistic. It is crazy. It's not. It's, It's, it, I mad respect.


Yeah. But I will, I'll go ahead and speak for, my guess is the majority of the roster, it's not so much like pride and I mean yes, it is maybe, maybe like 25% of it. But dude, we're dedicated to the product. We're dedicated to the product. Isn't That amazing? Dude. You Can't, you can't, you can't let this company down. You cannot let this company down. But you're, you're also, I I feel that like fully and I've been here three years. I will not fail on behalf of the wwe e Well, That and also for yourself. And, and I think that's why you're successful. And I think that's why the top level guys and girls in our company are successful. 'cause yes, they won't fail for the WE but they also won't fail for themselves. Yeah, yeah. True.


Yes. You know, I, I feel like, listen, I'm not, and I bet you feel the same way. I do. I'm not tooting my own horn, but I have failed at very few things in my life. Well, it must be nice. Which is why I've gotten to where I am today. No, I really, and I'm not trying to be an asshole about it or have an ego about it. Yeah. But I've been very successful in everything I've done from college through my news career to here. Oh yeah. I've made mistakes. There's been failures along the, along the way, but for the most part I've been pretty successful because I've got this unbelievable work ethic. Yeah. Like you do. Look at the stuff you all do. And that's what drives me. Like I don't, I you were talking about this earlier 28 years, I could be rested on my laurels.


I could have retired. Yeah. I couldn't have signed a new contract if I didn't want to. But every day I feel like, okay, I did it. I thought I had a great rumble. I gotta have a good raw on Monday. Yeah. Yeah. And I gotta have a great raw the next week because if I don't have a good show, it hurts you guys. It hurts the boys and girls that are in the ring because you guys are drawing money and you guys are trying to establish a product. I have got to be on every single time that I am on my, See, I love, I love that org related sentiment. And it's something that in our world, we don't feel we're we're on bosses. Right? Yeah. I mean, I mean, until WWE e You know, it was the same for him. It's like, dude, if I wanna do this, I'm gonna do this. If I want to take a risk in this direction and, and it fucking fails, who cares? Like it doesn't.


I I haven't felt that mentality in a long time. And it's, I'm jealous. I'm actually super, super enni of It. It's sick. It's Sick. I super Of it. I tell people, I'm like, dude, I love having a job. Yeah. Yeah. And I love working for the Wwe. We're a family. Yeah. Yeah. Dude's Sick. That's so sick. We're a family. You see it at ringside and you've gotten inside. I've, I've, I've really watched the match a maturation of you over the last few years and how comfortable you've gotten with us. You know, like in the beginning it was like, You know, we didn't, I don't, especially me, like I didn't know how to act toward, toward Logan Paul. I don't think Logan Paul know how to act toward us. And now you've, you're part of the family now and it's, it Feels, it certainly feels like, You know, why? Well, I'm, I'm, I'm pretty closed off in general. Like, dude, I, my team is extremely skinny. Like for the output, tiny, that we do it tiny, there's literally like four or five of us. Right. And I, I like it that way.


'cause like in general, I don't like people. Right. And then over turn the club, You know, I just, I mean like, I just don't, can't, I Used to can't relate. And then now, Now I'm Talk To everyone. But no, I just, I I started to like, open up a little more and it, it, it takes some time with me. But I realize like kind of how similar everyone is backstage. Yep. And I the saying that I I feel like fits the vibe. Yeah. Like of, of WWE e is, we're all here 'cause we're not all there. Yeah, that's Right. Everyone's a little, it's, it's the cuckoo island of misfit toys. Yes. Is it, Is it? And That's what it feels like. Everyone's like witty, just like fucking with each other. Like laughing, having fun. And I, there's a lot of good people in the company To see Cm Punk having the funniest today after what he went through 10 years ago is incredible.


But like, you guys, like your chemistry is what is, is Pat and I chemistry, there's the introvert and there's the extrovert. Yeah. Yeah. And that is how it is like with McAfee, like, I'm like you, I don't wanna talk to anybody. Yeah. I don't, I gotta be polite obviously, but I just wanna keep my head down and go do what I gotta do. Pat. Holy shit. And he's like that behind the scenes. Oh my God, bro. I remember when I met Him single, he came up to me in person. He had a 15 minute conversation with a security guy yesterday. I'm like, God, we gotta go to Gorilla. He Gotta, hes it all the time, bro. He sees it with me all the Time's. Craziness. But listen, I, we have an unbelievable corporate structure and Nick Kahan, Paul Veck Lee fitting those three men have changed my life forever. Be indebted for them. And it's because of that mentality and because of the trust that they put in all of us.


Is that you, I would go through a wall for them. Yeah. Like, and, and You know, you really, I mean, Paul and I, hunter and I have been together since day one. I mean, he gave me a wedgie my first two months here on television. Right. That's how our started. Right. And we've been together forever. And he, you know, Paul and I professionally, I mean, it's, it's just an unbelievable relationship. He trusts me. I trust him. Nick, as You know, is just an incredible human being. Yeah. I don't know if you had much interaction with Lee yet, but Lee is A, a little bit Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Lee Lee's a genius. Does. He gave Me some nice, he gave me some nice compliments yesterday. Yeah. No, We can see it in the product. It's, and it's cool. I think they're also, I think the company now is a little, from what I hear, more receptive to the ideas that the talent has.


Oh my God, dude. It's so different. Like for the most part, our our talent are given bullet points for their promos. Yeah. And it, they're not really scripted much anymore. Yeah. I mean, there's certain things y'all have to hit. 'cause the storylines, right? Yeah. But so they're able to be themselves who knows the character more than you guys. Right. Yeah. That's really important. Putting together matches. I is now become Paul the producers and the talent. Yeah. Which before it was Vince. Right. You know, so it, it's, and it's really helped the product and, and people are having fun. Dude. Everyone, You know, you see the locker room now, people are having a blast. Yeah, yeah. Because of themselves. Yes. And I think it's even more important nowadays too, as there is some breakout from the silo that is the WWE being the only platform people have their own platforms.


Yeah. So if he's gonna go out and tell a story, and then he's gonna go and put that on his, his channels with 25, 30 million followers in the channels. Of course he wants the story to be creatively aligned with what he wants to be to an extent at least. Right? Yeah, of course. So it's, so it seems like in that respect, even the WWE is making all the right plays. Well, and the Company was so restrictive for so many years. Like, you know, our talent wouldn't be able to go out and you know, we had a big controversy over the Twitch streams a few years ago. Yeah. You know, but now it's, everything's opened up. Go be a brand. The big speed, the big thing about our company. Yeah. Kai, the big thing about our company is we want you as a performer to develop your brand. We in fact have people in place in our offices that are helping our talent, talent, especially younger talent, Talent development, Help them grow their brand.


I feel like I should be on that team. A hundred percent. You probably should. Percent. Oh, I'm trying to get McAfee to on that team too. I think you guys are, dude, I'm definitely gonna Reach about that. Unbelievable examples of people that have just created something like out of thin air. Really, really. I mean the, the stuff that you've created to me, and I, and I'll admit again, I'm learning right. I've learning over the years of all what, what you all do. And I didn't know Logan Paul at all a few years ago when you came to the company. Obviously I had to learn more about you. Yeah. And the more I read and it's like, I'm just completely blown away with, with, with what you've created. And the same thing with Pat. I mean, You know, he is an NFL punter. Like we always knew he was entertaining, especially when he was a player. Yeah. But to create what he's created. And he's Incredible.


Incredible. It's craziness. And like, I have so much respect for that. Like, I, I'm a lifer. I'm a WWE Lifer dude. I I, I I appreciate the kind words, you know? Seriously, You know, I wanna say one thing about the, the JD spot. Perhaps you could help me understand why he did that. I have no idea. I I, I texted him the other day. I said, dude, what are you thinking? Yeah. Why? Why did he do that? I, I, I texted my match Producer Shane. Yep. My guy. Yep. Oh yeah. And, and I'm Like, hurricane. Yep. You know, we, we were talking about it and I, I was like, Shane, like this wouldn't have even made it past like, the ideation phase. Like, like with the distance. Yep. But that distance and then the table right there, They probably just called it in the ring. I bet's probably what they did.


Crazy. He's insane. He's, we, we make fun of him all the time. 'cause he got a big head and stuff. Yeah. Fun. He is one of the nicest guys on the planet. He's a hard worker. Yeah. Very respectful. I love jd. I've loved him since he was back, You know, in the NXC UK days and Yeah. Jordan Devlin and just really cool dude. We have so many great people. Yeah, Dude. Yeah, dude. It's it's sick company to look for. Dude. It really is. I don You don't always know why shit happens. Dude, look at the Don Chick ad trade last night. Did you see that? Oh God. Who knows. We were sitting Knows people. I actually screamed. Holy shit. It's insane Wave. Like, what are you talking about? I said Donk just went to Freaking insane. The Lakers. Insane. I heard a lot about that. What was going on behind the scenes. I was reading a lot about that today. A hundred percent. Yeah. Not being in shape.


Prime Prime sponsors the Lakers. So there you go. No bro, it's, it's a really, it's this big deal. Let, let's Go. And by the way, like the prime logo on the mat, Crazy. And now all the logos we've got on the mat, like this would've never happened. We always un we, You know, I understand. I understood Vince's perspective that it, that was sacred. Yeah. But you know, it's 2025. This The world, You know, where, you know, where it makes it a little difficult for talent, especially if talent is trying to build their brand. Yep. The last thing you want in your really cool move po like is is, or you, the Title don't say brand title is A brand. Yeah. But the is is A brand. Yeah. But when, But when Logan Paul is in the ring and this is brand Oh, Oh, for me, it's Fantastic.


For me, it's great. It's just gotta be the right brands too. Like, I would wanna get my head smashed in over a Wingstop logo. Are you serious? That's amazing, dude. That's what we, that's all we talked about for the rest of the night. Last night he wanted to go to Wing stock. You were talking about the branding thing though, right? Like, it's funny, like I'm sort of developing my own brand, like, and I'm not even working on it. Is it a competitive hydration product? No. No. Not at all. If it was, there Are a lot of things I've thought about. No, that would be great. Right. And by the way, I'm gonna have my new Michael Cole drink on the, that's the thing. No, it's just like, it's just funny how it just starts to evolve, right? Yeah. Like I never thought in those terms until I started working with Pat and Pat's like, you are missing out on so Much stuff, dude. Yes. All the talent are, You know, all the talent are, everyone should be thinking about how to not just build yourself, but how to build businesses.


Yeah. Long lasting businesses that have impact. It's, it's, it's the next level of conversation. And use the vehicle you've been given use the vehicle you've been given. I think every, every talent in the WWE should be thinking like that. Yeah. And, and it would be cool to be on that team to potentially, like, You have to do that help build that. You have to, that it's, It's pretty, it's, I I see it pretty clearly for, for some, some of the folks in there. Yeah. I mean, there's a, there, there, there's a lot that could really be for Sure. Really Be building off on that. One, one last question from me. If, if there's a future Don IUs Mike and the Mad Dog. Yeah. I know I'm hitting you in this sweet spot right now watching this. Right. Right Now, future commentator for the WWE e how do they, how do they, how could they potentially break through into the space in a time where it's very noisy out there?


Do you have any, do you have any advice for Somebody else? Are you, are you just talking about wrestling or are you talking about just in General? I mean, like, if they want to get into the funnel. It's hard. It's, it's much harder than it was. Yeah. You know, when I went to college in the mid eighties, I, I, You know, I went to Syracuse, which is hotbed for sports broadcasters. Yeah. And luckily at the time, You know, there was, you know, four television stations and a couple KV cable TV stations and there was no social media. So there, there weren't a lot of jobs then. So I was pretty privileged to get, I was the youngest announcer ever hired by Network radio when I Got outta school. And so I, I was, was lucky. But now there's So much Programming out there.


Yeah. That if you wanna be a broadcaster, you can get in, go to school for it, work on it, get in at a small level and just build yourself. You can only do it through reps as You know. Okay. But also how much of it is like the voice, because like, I, you're very li listen, listenable listenable A lot. I, You know, I, I did voice training in school and stuff like that. Yeah. But yeah. But it, you Have, you have the radio. Yeah. Yeah. You have the voice. You listen to Tessa to he's an course. Unbelievable voice of that. Has a ton to do with it too. It does, it does. Right. You don't hear a lot of high pitched, squeaky people doing, You know. No. You know, Wade Barrett's got that nice English barone that just sticks out Pat. It's, You know, pat and, You know, it's just, that has a lot to do with it. It does. But it's, it's experience more than anything else.


You know, it's just going out there and being able to do, You know, I just, I Got lucky that I hit news radio at the time when that was, if you wanted to be a serious journalist, you went to news radio. Yeah. At the time. Yeah. And that's, and I Got lucky and I Got to cover some unbelievable things. It really helped shape my life. And, and then coming into wrestling, I at least I had a broadcasting background and I had done some sports too. I just had to learn this product. But I was ahead of the game when I Got here, which is good. How much, how much more you got in your contract, can you say? Yeah, eight years. Amazing. All Right. Well hopefully we ride out these next eight years together, Michael. I do. Well, hopeful you're gonna be here that long. We need you. Yeah. Yeah. No, I love it, man. Yeah, I love it. As long as they'll have me and as long as the fans keep booing, Stick around.


Yeah. You know, stick around. Listen, I, I, I'll be honest, Logan, you know, and You know, just time to, you know, pat you on the back a little bit. First off, thanks for having me. Yeah, of course. I never thought in a million years what I told my kids I was doing You podcast. They were like, you, you're an old man. I said Yeah. But I said, I am so excited. You know what I'm saying? How excited I'm to do this. But like, when you first came aboard, like, and again, I didn't know much about you. Sure. I, I, I learned so much over the years. Like, I was like, ah, here's another celebrity guy gonna come in. You're gonna do a match, whatever. Roll my eyes at it. Yeah. You know, Like, bad bunny. He He, he did well though. Yeah, he did. Well, he's good. But, but then you just like, like I, I've never, I've, and I was impressed when Pat had his matches.


Like His match was freaking was incredible. He's an incredible athlete. My god. He is. I was too. I was like, Damn, I have never, and I'm not just blowing smoke here. In the 28 years I've been in this business, I have seen all time greats, hall of Famers, John Cena, one of my great friends. And I believe the greatest of all time because of longevity. And how long he's been on top for me though, Logan, I have never seen anyone come into this business. And I know you said you wrestled your whole life and everything. This is different. And I've never seen anybody come in and do what you've done in such a short period of time. It is absolutely amazing to me. And I, and I'm not just saying that 'cause I'm on your show and I've said it on the air, it's just, I've never, I've never seen someone take to this, not only the skills in the ring, but I'm talking about promos and the way that you manipulate the crowd and just that personality and that are, it's different.


And I've never seen anybody come into this business with that ever before. And I'm only getting better. Thank you. That, that, that makes me feel a way I can't even describe 'cause emotions are a little weird for me. They Are for me too. But I'm starting to get a little more emotional. And as I get older, I think Yeah. It's easier when You say something that is extremely objective and factual. Well, and it just, it it changes the dynamic Of the conversion. And I mean, I I seriously mean it about you. Like I, I did not know what to expect working with Logan Paul. Yeah. I don't think anybody did. Yeah. You are completely different than I thought you were gonna be intelligent. Thank you. It's unbelievable. Thank you.


Thank you. But the emotion is, as I get older, I think I get more emotional and obviously with children Yep. It's a very important thing. But I don't, I think that's the other thing over the last few years of how I have gotten better at my craft is allowing myself to be emotional. Like Cody Rhodes, for instance, Cody and I, I've known Cody since he was a kid. Yep. And, You know, been through all the trials and tribulations with that guy. And when he won at Mania last year, like I legitimately cried. Like it was, it was because of what he's gone through. Right. I know when John has his last match, because of what I went through with him, it's gonna be a very emotional moment. But I think that helps me with the audience because it's like, this guy's real, like this isn't fake shit.


This isn't scripted. This is Michael Cole loving, not only a product, but people that he's known for his whole life. And you want them to be successful. And I hope that I'm able to call, You know, the highlights of your career. 'cause I would love to de develop that relationship with you. Yeah. Where I'm able to be emotional about you winning your first world championship. Yeah. Which will happen and stuff. Like, you're winning a Royal Rumble. You winning money in the bank. I, I'd like to be emotional about that. And hopefully this is our first step on that road. Yeah. Together to be able to do that. Well, So, I mean, and Shellah, God willing, how are you getting to Cleveland? McAfee's got a private jet. Why don't you, why don't you come on ours instead. But I'm doing his show tomorrow.


Damn. They're flying there today. Yeah, I know. That's a, I heard, but yeah, I'm just, what, what, what Jet Is it? I don't know what he's got tomorrow. Well, we got a G five, so. No, It's a little bigger. Pat, I gotta call you. Maybe I don't, do you show tomorrow? I hope he, I hope he has a G six. That would make me so happy, dude. No way. No way. But Do You know what you're doing tomorrow? I, I, I don't know what I'm doing yet. I'm don't, but I know we're going to Cleveland, which is where I'm from. Yeah, yeah. I'm from Cleveland. Yeah.
