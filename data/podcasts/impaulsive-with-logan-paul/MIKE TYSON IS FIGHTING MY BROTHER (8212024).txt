Like I, Got your ulcer medicine from my neighborhood. I was like, what do I do with this?


This? Yeah. I feel like we're gonna have a lot of uncontrolled s going on. What's going on? So, so you just did your presser with Jake? Yeah. Ahead of this November 19th. That's the 14th or 15th, huh? I'll get you the date. Got it. Right here. It's gonna be on November 15th. Actually, that was my mistake. How did, how do you feel about the presser and You know? Did anything unexpected happen? Nah, it's just, this is beautiful, man. This is just You know, this is what The world needs. You know. I know it sounds crazy, but this is what The world really needs right now. You fighting Jake Paul is what The world Needs. Yeah. Well, listen, the pay-per-views, prove it, right?


Yeah. Yep. All right. So that's the truth. What I know, and listen, I know it looks crazy. You look at a YouTube guy, you look at me. But look at the f Look what we brought here. Look what we did. You know. That's not funny at all. No, it's very serious. Yeah. Now that's not funny at all. You can't, you can't laugh at that. Mike Don don't wanna laugh at anything that might upset you. Be mostly because when I sit with you, I think of 1990s, 19 like Atlantic City, Mike, I'm sc you know, I'm quite scared. I'm not 'cause of the first show we did. But when I watch you now, a lot of it is life is beautiful. I want to embrace you. I want to touch your hand or hug you. I wanna play with small animals maybe and embrace them as well. Is there any chance we can I have Small animals. I know. Yeah. Is there any chance We can just get you to say something quickly for just 10 seconds of old school, 1990s?


Mike, can you just say some really fucked up shit, right? Like, here, I'll help you. Hold on a second. That's Supposed to be Jake Paul. Yo, Mike, I'm the problem child. And you're gonna, I'm gonna fuck you up and I'm gonna fuck all the fans up too. After You look like Aquaman. I was looking for something. I was looking For smoke, bro. You gotta absolutely smoke, bro. I was looking for something a little bit more. Yeah. Coming back from that one You know. No. So what Mike's trying to do is what I actually see my brother trying to do, because obviously I know my brother very well. He's my brother. Right? But, and I see him trying to get that, that villain outta you. But here you are, You know, using words like beautiful and you seem so peaceful and calm.


I think some people are excited to see that version of Mike Tyson that is the killer come out on November 15th. Absolutely. That's gonna happen. But this is what I learned from prior experience. When that tough guy, Mike Tyson comes out when it's not necessary that comes out. I'm always in handcuffs. So I I'm very careful when that guy comes out and break out. You break, you break out in handcuffs. Yeah. Oh, no. Oh, Man, every time I drink getting ready to get in a fight, I break out in handcuffs. Out in handcuffs. But, but do you ever worry that, that, that Mike dies? Like what if you show up? What if you show up in the ring November 15th and you, instead of fighting, you start reciting poetry You know what I'm saying?


Or, or You know? Like I, like I said before, find a small animal. The pet in the center of the ring. No. Like, are you sure you can access that killer still? Hey, listen, and I'll do it Is. it is. Unfortunately, I have to fight and be that guy. I wish I could stop that guy. That guy haunts me. That's, that's, that's, that's, I wish I could stop that guy. I wish I could stop that guy. I wish that guy died. But he's here to stay. How do you, how do you access him? Just love my children. Love my family. That's how I just basically get rid of the Guy. No, no, no. How do you, how do you bring him back? Like what's, what's gonna do it? Listen, he wants to come back every second of my life. So it's so easy for him to come back. Yeah. Have you seen that scene in The Avengers?


You ever seen the Avengers Love the Avengers? Do You know that scene where Bruce Banner, the Hulk is like, that's my secret doctor. I'm always angry. And then he turns into the Hulk. Yeah. I feel like that's you. I'm a little hawkish. Yeah, I'm hawkish. Yeah, But that's your secret. It's always just right on the surface. You can, you can access that, that iron Mike, Tyson at any time. Only thing I have no, and all that child, we gonna keep it real. Right? Yeah. Only thing I have to think of, of being younger and people bully at me. Oh, that's how you got there. So, so did you feel at all like Jake was bullying you on the stage today? No. Closely. It gets to the fight. I'll feel bullied. Yeah. I get that feeling Because he, because he's gonna ramp up as well.


I know Jake You know. He, he, he, he's a shit talker. You know. And he, he'll get under your skin. Listen, this is what I found out from what, how old am I now? What? 58 You know what I found out the shit talkers. Get all the money, the shit talkers. Get all the attention. Yeah. The shit talkers. Get everything. We get a bad rap, but we get everything else. Yeah, they do good. Yeah. Nice. If you don't talk shit, what, what's the purpose of even going to the fight? Well, dude, I, it's, it's, it's crazy watching you on stage with him now, because he'll, he says some pretty disrespectful stuff. And it seems like you, you, you're not playing the game. Like you don't, you don't care to Don Don't think that's disrespectful.


I've been disrespected before. And this, and that's not even the same class of disrespect. He, he's given me compliments, if anything. Well, 'cause well, Mike, he, He Compli, He loves, he loves you. You know. He, he, everyone has to respect your ability as a boxer. And you're just a great person. And I know, like you and Jake are just our whole family. We've been like close. I love him too. But it's business. We all have to do business. You Know it's business and, and it's boxing, man. Like some crazy shit can happen in that ring. Hey, but it's who we are. Forget what everybody says. This guy's YouTuber, this YouTuber, this guy's a fighter. You. know what I mean? I've been many things too. But I'm a fighter. I'm an actor. I'm, I, I, I sell. I sell. I'm a salesman. I'm an entrepreneur.


But I, we're fighters. That's who we really are more than all this other stuff that we got going on. We're fighters. Him too. We're fighters. So how do you not fall into the trap that every fighter prior to you has fallen into with Jake in just telling themselves like, oh, this kid's a YouTuber. Everyone he else, everyone he fought has, has not been good enough. They're not me. And then they all end up on the canvas the same way as the last one. The, the difference between me and all the other guys that he fought. They weren't apprehensive of, afraid of him. Mm. I'm apprehensive and scary. So I'm totally different than them. You're, you're scary. I, I'm just that kind of person.


You know what I mean? I miss a scary guy. Be, you know, that's who I am. I miss my nerves, my scared. Because don don't want to get angry or anything. That's why I'm scared You're the scariest. But are, but are you scared at all? Do you, how much do you respect Jake's KO power? Are you scared at all? I'm not gonna let him hit me. Put my chin out there and let him hit me. No. Why would You, what is your biggest concern going into the fight? Is it, your gas, your gas tank. No, I'm doing really well. Alright. On the cardio. Yeah. I'm doing really well. Doing my sprints and all that stuff. Do, do you have a concern? Like anything that that, that you're a little worried about going in? Hey, no concerns than normal.


Just nervous. That's about it. All fighters are nervous. All athletes are nervous. I'm not gonna let no one tell me because I'm nervous. I'm afraid because I've been nervous my whole career and I've been very successful. Mike, I'm gonna be honest with you. I love you, Mike. Same. And I'm very nervous for you, Thank you for caring. I do care. I care about you and I care about my brother. And I know the path he's on right now. And it's ruthless Mike. I agree. It's pretty cool. It's cool. It's so cool to watch. And he's, he's, he's really crushing it. And, and I just feel like I want you to be okay in there, Mike. And I want you, you gotta take him serious, Mike. 'cause he's, I take Him extremely. So you I take him extremely serious.


These people don't take him serious. No, they don't. And that's, it's such a mistake. 'cause he's a, he's a, he's a real killer Mike. Like, he wanted to be a Navy SEAL before he started boxing in high school. He, he wants to be a Navy Seal. He wanted to go kill people on behalf of his country. And It, what you're saying is a lot to ask of an audience. It's a lot to ask of an audience to say, you should fear for Mike Tyson because Jake Paul is coming through. I'm not saying that that's, it's wrong to say it. That's true. But that is a tough pill to swallow. I've had this conversation with Logan many times in the show. There are humans and there's Mike, Tyson, Mike Tyson is not a human. I, and, and I know you don't like to hear this. Mike Tyson is a caged animal who at, at any moment can explode into a murderous rage that no boxer has ever had access to before You know that you do, you believe yourself to be the greatest of all time.


So it's got Is it Is it hard for you. When someone sits and says, you should be fearful of, of any man on this planet, let alone You know Jake Paul. Hey, I'm, I'm fearful. I'm fearful of my 13-year-old son. This is what I learned through my 58 years of experience, what my experience is that anyone's capable of killing you and my life and the way I live my life, and what I've seen, anyone's capable of killing you. So you should be apprehensive for anyone that, that's just my life. Life that I live. Everyone around me, anybody I know is capable of killing you. Even if don don't know you. That's how I look at people. They're all capable of killing you.


Mm. So I look at 'em at that, and I, I, my objectives like this. So they're capable of killing me. I'm don. Don't sleep on them. I'm not over overconfidence with anybody in life. I think that's how you have to go into this fight. I, what do I know? You know, but I, I just know Jake man, and like, I just wanna make sure you're okay. Well, I'm gonna be splendid. Yeah. Thank God. I appreciate you worried. Yeah. It's gonna be, it's gonna be a good night, man. I care. I care. But you're also not the only person, dude. Like, there's a lot of athletes, a lot of people out there who are like, You know, I saw KD last night and he was talking about, I don't want to talk about that fight. Because if something happens to Uncle Mike, it's not gonna be fun, dude.


People are gonna be angry. They'll be angry. Like, it's almost, it's almost like a weird duality for Jake where if he, if he loses, it's problematic. But if he beats Uncle Mike hard and beats him up, like that's a problem too. What do you think? Are you, are you, are you are, have you given Jake the permission to potentially do some real damage? Yeah. Yeah. Well, permission. Is that Just Like, I, I don't Y'all playing Patty cakes out there, or you're trying to kill each other? Well, what's the, what's the plan? Logan You know what's going on. There's no patty cake going on out there. No. You can't 'cause it when you're out there. The environment is just so tense. You've worked so hard for this moment. Everything you've put your whole life into is on the line.


It, you, you, you can't like fake that. Hey, This is what's gonna happen to make everything short. Two men are gonna fight. Somebody's gonna win. They might fight again, and then they go to their separate banks and life goes on. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How's your, how's your bout with marijuana? I never had a fight with it. It's always been my friend. A dance. Yeah. No, I mean, like, I guess like, okay, so the last time you were on this podcast, right? Again, five grams of mushrooms. I've never seen anything like it. And then I think I did your PA podcast. We may have been smoking a little bit. But obviously now that you're in Fight camp, have you had to pull back on the recreational usage of marijuana?


Just A little. Just a little. Just a little. You don't think it messes up your lungs? That's what they say. Huh? I personally, I I, I felt like it did for me. Because You're a quitter. You can't be quitting on You know. That's what Whis Kpa said as well. A quitter. You can't be a quitter. Whis Kpa said There'll be no quitter motherfucker, no quitters involved. Damnit, give be a quitter. Damn. Wizz had the say. I was like, bro, what do, what's, what do I do? Like, those Are stones, real stones. Say you're acquit. Yeah, He did. He roasted me real stone. He said, man, you gotta keep going. I was like, all right. What about the, what about the mushrooms? Oh, no. No way, fucking way. No Way. No way. No No way. Let me observe him again. I gotta see 'em.


I gotta look at him just like last time. All right, what do we got here? This is a little bit of a lighter amount. This time we're talking maybe two and a half grams dried shrooms blue spots. Looks like he's on the same stuff as last time. Gold caps. Real nice stuff, Mike. Real nice stuff. Good looking stuff. Are you, are you gonna take these rooms today? I, I, I have to take 'em when I train. I always train with my mushroom. Oh Wait, what? I train on mushrooms. Why? Because I feel beautiful and it makes me take, take, take me to heaven, baby. That's amazing. But, but that's the thing that scares me. I know what people on mushrooms are like. They wanna hug and laugh. You ever tried like meth, Meth? Listen, know what happens? No, this happened to me. Once I check this out, I go to my probation officer.


Oh, I shouldn't even say this shit. Alright. We Can cut it. We can cut it if you don't want. No, I want you to say whatever you listen. I go to my probation officer. Right. So I did, I did some cocaine, but I did some cocaine like two or three days ago. Right. But I go to, well, at least I thought I did cocaine. So then I go to the take my blood. I did You know it's been three or four days cocaine's out my system. Yeah. So my probation officer said, ah, Mike, you, you, you, you came up positive for meth. I know You know. I know the tweaker. When I see him one, I'm like, what? He just thought, because I'm Mike, he's not gonna do no mess. He's stupid. If he did meth, he's stupid. It's Mike Tyson. But you, this is a fake test, Mike. But the real as can be. I did some meth Accidentally.


Accidentally Accidental meth. So. wait, will you be on mushrooms for your fight? Maybe if I'm not on mushrooms, I'll be on PCP. That's a good one too. That's Crazy. Residue a mushroom than not. I won't be on mushrooms, but be on a residue mushroom. Like Aus. I like. Yeah. Ooh. S We need to do a whole show on drugs. Me and you One time. Yeah, just one time, bro. You need To do this. You need to look at YouTube and look at the history of drugs. Really? Oh, blow your mind. What? What? It's just a coverage of all the different drugs throughout the course of time. Yeah. And, And explained the, the narration of all the drugs where they became from since the beginning of life. That's, That's interesting.


We've been getting high. This is what I found. We've been getting high for 200 million years. So, so this is what we're saying. Were high in general liquor everything for two. Wait, but Who But wasn't that dinosaurs? Or they were further back? That, that was dinosaurs. So you think dinosaurs were doing meth? I think dinosaurs invented all the drugs. No, I think all the residue, the shit, the piss the, I think that invented invented all the drugs, Bro. Kevin Durant would lose his mind right now. Kevin Durant told me last night, he doesn't believe that dinosaurs ever existed. Well, what do you have to say directly to Kevin Durant about that? Dude, he was positive. He said, we don't know what they looked like. We don't know where these bones are coming from. I do not believe that dinosaurs existed. What do you say to that? Well, I can only say this.


I don't believe a man walked on the moon either. I don't either, Mike. Alright. He could say that about dinosaurs. I don't believe these niggas walked in the room. This Is recently, this recently happened like 30 years, 40 years ago or something. Right. Right. They look like little toys up there. Yeah. Yeah. They look like toys. You remember, like, we used to have those little You know those space thing with it looked like rock. So, and robots. Yeah. Yeah. You know square hair push. And they go like This. They do. I I I I'm with you on that one. The dinosaur thing really infuriated me. I I tell 'em why. I just think that's ridiculous. Tell 'em why You're A collective. I'm, I'm, I love dinosaurs. I'm going digging for dinosaurs. I used to think, you know, millions of years ago, our an animals were bigger. Yep.


You know what I mean? And they couldn't survive long. You know. They just couldn't survive. There wasn't much food around there. They couldn't catch the, the predator. Their predators couldn't catch the prey. Yep. So they normally died from starvation. Right? Yeah. That's basically how they said this big bomb thing happened. But really, normally, they normally all animals die from starvation back then. So if you had to say yes or no to dinosaurs right now, and I mean this really saying this too. My father-in-law's the same way. He don't believe that happened. What? Say again? My Father-in-law's the same way. He don't believe in Don't believe dinosaurs. No. That's crazy. I have, I have dinosaur bones. I own dinosaur bones. I'm going digging for dinosaur bones myself. I listen, man, why are they in the earth? How does Kevin dur explain fossil Earth? So I asked him this. I asked him this. He said, when they put together a a, a, a full skeleton, they have to put bones together from different places, but it doesn't matter.


And do You know what I said to him? I said, if there's proof of just one dinosaur bone, that's proof of dinosaurs in general. That's what I said. That's what I said to him, bro, he's gonna really get mad about this episode. Nah, it him and I'm mad. And then Quavo backed him up. Quavo. And it turned into a groupthink situation where I was wrong for believing dinosaurs. Now you got Mike saying dinosaurs invented meth qua on the show. That's the Most realistic. Listen, that's been Said. You tell me the dinosaur, their bones, you scrape their bones off, smoke their bones, or sniff their bone. You're not gonna get an effect. Do you have the bo you have the bones. I can sniff in the house. House. We can give it a shot. We can actually do. I'm I'm, I'll be down with that with you All. All right. After you done fighting, Jake, let's smoke dynos. I'm down. This is Dude, before you hopped in the podcast today, Mike and I were bo this.


Mike and I were both like, dude, we think Mike Tyson is much wiser than people think. I think, you know, I think you know some shit. Well, it's always better to let people know. Think that you don't know anything. I know. Yeah. for Sure. for Sure. Make 'em think you're dumb. And then smoke 'em. No, this is the whole thing. It think about this. Who are we? Where did we come from? Actually, I think about it every day. Where Did our million grandfather come from? What color was our million? Grandmother, grandfather. Were they cave people? What were they? I think about It every Day. Asian, what were they? Probably Asian. Yeah. We don't know who we are. Does That ever torture your mind? Torture You all the time? I think, well, who the fuck am I Right? Is. it is this all thing from God for me to be this or am or am I'm in this world by myself and everybody's just in here to please me.


God made it that Way. Way's, You know what that's called. Horizon theory. Really? That's what it's called. It me. It, I always Thought, I tell my wife I a baby. I, when I do mushrooms, I feel like I'm the only one in this world. And everybody's just here to just Me. It's a whole thing. Please me. It's called, it's a philosophy. It's a, it's called horizon theory. And everyone's put here as an actor in your world and you are the center of it. And it's a whole thing. You should look it up. It's very interesting. You might be the main character. A hundred percent. No, we are the, in our story, we are the main character. No, you are, we're the side characters. I do feel like a cyclist for your story. Yeah. But then your guys have stories too. No, we're just for your story. Can I listen? I think the same fucking thing was helping me to really believe that. Because I feel like I'm a mushroom and I think You know the mushrooms does this to you, right?


It says, man, you're the greatest in The world. God, you're the greatest. Everybody. Well, you're the greatest in The world. And it says so many great things about you and says, but you did feel that test You know you weren't nice to that person. Right? Whoa said, I run baby, baby my head. I did mushrooms, baby. I'm sorry. My head hurting. My head hurt. Baby. Jesus. It's killing me. It's killing me. And my wife used get so mad 'cause I come this sweating and crying, baby, I'm my mushrooms. I took, took too much. But, and she says, no, not leave me alone. Don't start it slow. Leave me alone. Sounds like a humbling experience. Oh yeah. That's what it is, brother. That's what it is. Real humble. Yeah. Well, we, we we've, we've been been able to see the Mike Tyson, arc You know and man. Yeah, like I said, just so, so wise. You have any idea how the pyramids were invented?


Invented Listen. Right. This is just the real deal. This is, this is just, this is just the real deal. Right? These people slave themselves to do this stuff. They did it. They built it. And people like us built it. Ain't no goddamn alien. You don't think so? No. My wife thinks that too. What, what was Rogan's stance on it? He thought it was something extra terrestrial as well too. If it's extra terrestrial, it's in the people. It's not no guy from Alien coming down here and all that stuff. What about all the recent UFO sightings? Well, No, he was going on the pyramids. Listen, you're talking sleds and pulleys, pulley systems. I'm just thinking of sophisticated workers that's far beyond our imagination.


Okay. No, now. No. Listen, listen. Then it's not just humans. Where did these, where did these pipe listen? Sure. Mike Tyson. This is what one thing we believe we're smart. We're nothing but fucking idiots. Okay. Only thing we know is what people told us. We don't know shit. Only. That's imagine, imagine if you didn't read anything else and you went into life, you'd be a fucking idiot. Right. You'd be at the plain block. We only, we only have knowledge because we got knowledge from what people left after the left for us. Yeah. Right. Yeah. That's the truest statement ever. Humans are idiots. All of us Included. Listen, can I tell you something? God or who the creator of invented is up there laughing like a motherfucker. This is a comedy.


Life is a comedy. Human life is a comedy. Yeah. Well, That's another philosophy too. There's another, another school of thought that there's a hyper advanced civilization. It's basically like a sims theory. That we are just simply a game for a, a hyper advanced simulation. Someone's controlling you. Right? Now. I. Think that you say that. you know, sometimes my film when he was younger and he looks, and I say looking at the Anth, I say You know. Just like we looking at these ants, there's somebody looking at us. Yes. I think that's exactly right. Yeah. Who the fuck? We think we ought to be superior to something. No You know what I mean? Sometimes we, we actually, we don't even, sometimes we shit on ourselves. Sometimes we, we shit on who the fuck are we to think that we are superior to something? Yeah. No, no. You know. No.


I think it's a good way to remain humble. You can't take yourself serious, man. Not in this world. You can't take yourself serious. I gotta ask you one question that's gonna upset you a little bit. And this I'm not upset. You can't upset me, brother. It might. And this is gonna be the last like conspiracy thing that We can talk about when food or fighting or girls or something. Right? There's been a lot of speculation recently. I don't even wanna say this. You Do it. You can do it. You can do it. Do it About deep breath. Deep breath. Deep breath. First take. Deep breath. It's sad. Mike. It's deep Breath. Deep breath. You might not be ready to hear this. I'm babe. Come on Mike. It's about pigeons. Go for it. You eat pigeons. No, don don't. I don't eat pigeons. Mike. Thank God Mike. There's a lot of people out there right now who believe that pigeons are actually CIA Drones.


They're capable of It. No, but they're not, they're not actual living animals that they're automated machines sent out by the CIA. Birds Aren't real. Spy spy drones. Spy. Listen. I'm sure they have it. My birds are not like that. But listen, How do you know your birds are? Listen, lemme tell you something about pigeons. Tyson. Sorry man. Listen, in World War ii, they do it. Israel do it right now. They still use these pigeons to travel with messages. And they got cameras on 'em now. Yeah. Yeah. you know how intelligent these, they can make a pigeon turn light off. Teach 'em how to turn the light off. Teach 'em how to type of, what are those things again? Typewriter. Teach 'em how to type. These guys are fucking, these pigeons are geniuses, man. I'm sorry. They're genius. So sorry. I just had the craziest picture of a pigeon just typing off a fucking turn paper.


I'm so sorry. And, and when it hits that thing at the end, it goes, No dude. Yeah, I can see that. Does he use his, His, how does he do it Beak or does he use his little tiny hands, His feet and his beak. But listen Crazy. Look. Look how, look how fast. Look at a pin. Look how far he can fly. Imagine the pit flying 2000 miles flying from like America to Europe or some shit like that. That's endurance You Know what I mean? That's endurance. So you don't think they're drones for the CIA? You can use them as drone. Got It. But there's a big movement, Mike, of people who say that birds aren't real. Come on now. You know birds Are real. you know what they say? They say this. We're in New York. Sure. Someone hears from New York or the surrounding areas.


Yeah. Our producer Dylan. Yep. Y'all ever see a baby pigeon? Yeah. Because we're not in the net. That's why we don't see a baby pigeon. Is that why? Yeah. I Got. A I Got. Like 200 of them. But your, your pigeons might be real, but they're saying that New York pigeons are just spawned as adults From Mayor Adams. Well, if that's true, why do they keep in important hawks and falcons to kill them? It's Op not real. It's a psyop. It's a false flag. Like a psyop. Let's make 'em believe that the pi You. know what I'm saying? Listen, I could see that too. Because in some of the hotels in Vegas, they, they brought falcons in for the birds, for the pigeons and stuff.


But there's too many, there's not enough falcons and haws and I'm, I know and falcons and hawks, they don't eat pigeons in the street. They eat the good pigeons like mine. You do have some solid ass pigeons. Yeah. And, and the hawks don't eat the pigeons in the street. That's what the people don't get. The falcons and the hawks don't eat those pigeons. They eat the pigeons that people import. Like the imported. Yeah. Fancy pigeon like that. A five pigeon. Yes. Listen, just think. What do you think the highest pigeon in The world costs? Man, I would, I, my assumption would be a lower figure of the $872 range. 2 million. No freaking way. Look it up Way. Look it up. That's more than a Steph Curry rookie card. Look It up baby. Look it up baby. I'm in the right business. Who is, What is this like an albino like pigeon with like an orchid?


No, it's almost like people skin. Wow. About your bloodline. Knew Kim, a 2-year-old Belgian racing pigeon held the Guinness World record for the most expensive pigeon ever sold at auction. Selling for 1.8 million. Yeah. What was, so he was a champion racing pigeon. So they race him that pigeon you could deliver a message. A million. I bet that's a real pigeon. Would you wanna have that pigeon? Huh? When you get this Netflix bag, you could buy the most expensive pigeon ever. I, those are not, that's just not my thing. Everybody always tell me, do this 'cause this is the money. I like the rolling pigeons. I'm in love with them. Really? So if I get style, I get these birds, I give 'em to my friend. These expensive birthday worth 30,000, 200,000. I give them my friend.


And what, remind me, 'cause I know we talked about in the first episode, but what, what did the pigeons originally do for you? What do they do for you now? Why do you love pigeons so much? Oh, this is a long story. This is crazy. I might cry. Listen. Right. I used to get bullied and this guy bullied me and killed my pigeon. Hit me in the face with the pigeon and shit. What kicked me spit on me. And my first fight was over a pigeon, No way. First fight ever No way. So it started, the hole Started this. That's cool. I'm A fucking pigeon. Oh, you gotta ride with the pigeons till you Yeah dude, I die. That's, That's actually poetic That serious. It's a real Deal. No, that's insane. Real Deal. You know Jake is fighting under the pseudonym El Gao guy.


That's pigeon right? It's Rooster. It's Brewster. So would you be, what if you, does that worry you at all that maybe you might hurt a fellow pigeon or rooster? Well, listen, Now, I gotta take the hawks and Falcons out sometime. Yes. Wow. Do they hit my bird? I. Got Dude. And I love those birds. I, I been looking and said they magnificent. Yeah, they are. These guys are eating my babies. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you have favorites? I like to say, I like to say no I don't, but every time I see something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. New one. Yeah, I like that one. Can we talk about the sport of boxing a little bit outside of this fight? Is there anybody you're watching right now? You keeping your eye on like a Crawford or anybody like that?


I just came from Crawford last fight. This in La? Yes. You went to it. What'd you think? I thought that was a tough guy. And that guy gave You, know what I mean? I'm glad that he came back the last two rounds. you know, that guy was very awkward and strong. Super awkward. Yeah. And I was, this guy fights anybody. Crawford fights anybody. Yeah. I don't agree with that. You know. 'cause you gotta look good in order for, for you won't mess up your next fight. 'cause if you fight this guy, he don't look good. The fans ah, don don't want, he's not gonna look good or win with this guy. You gotta constantly have fights that you know and fight a guy that's gonna make you look good. The guy gotta pressure you or something. you know, this guy's running around. He crawford's not used to this kind of movement and stuff. Weird fit. Yeah. All is a motherfucker.


You think, you think the, are you ready? You think the world's ready for Crawford? Canelo. I support Crawford and Canelo boat. But I, I I mean it's the fight people want to see. Right. Now I don't think they wanna see him fight Cane. You think so? You think they wanna see him fight Canelo? Yeah. for Sure. for Sure. And it's why I think it's what Crawford wants too. Right. He wants to fight him too. I think he wants to make history. It's a big fight. Well that the make history is worth doing it. Yeah. Yeah. I think he wants to. You ever follow the wwe? I love wwe.

But this stuff is not fake. These guys are Killing themselves. Fake. The fake is fake is fake isn't the word. I think there was a time where people would say, use the word fake to kind of like diminish it. Yeah. Right. But like, that's just, that's just not the word. And I, I'll tell you like from experience man, and everybody who comes to the WWE that gets hurt that not only do they get hurt, they'll come and feel the, the, the, the ring. And it's hard. So hard. It's hard. And everyone goes, wow, I thought this was like a trampoline, including me. I had that same reaction when I first touched the ring.

It don't hurt him, Mike. Nah dude. I, I'm saying Yeah. What? No, he's in the ring with me. What the fuck you talking about? Oh, bro, you can't, can't have that mindset No way. And bro, he's not. I look at, I look at he's not a YouTuber. Listen, I look at him as a killer. He is Mike. That's, Well that's how I look at Him. And he's getting like better and better. It's crazy. I know This. I know. That's why I gotta give him before he gets too good.


You're right. Yeah. You're totally right. Mike On the boxing thing. Last question on it, or at least for now, down that pipe. See that man right there? Controlling the camera. This guy right here? Yeah. Tell, write down that pipe. Tell any, tell, tell people who are out there saying, we think Mike's too old for this fight. Tell, tell him what you think about that. If you think I'm too old for this fight, you need to come tell me in my faith. Whoa. You won't, You Won't Whoa. I don't think they're gonna do that. Mike. I I have my father in the room, so Dad, you wanna take seat? Hey Don. think so. He's also the father of Jake Paul. Sure. You sure?


Positive. Well, How you doing sir? So yeah, there he is. That, that's, that's your microphone. So look, so look, obviously the guy to your left is Mike Tyson. I'm sure you grew up watching him. And this guy was running the boxing, baddest Man on the Planet. Baddest man on the planet actually. And now he's fighting your son. That's gotta be an interesting experience. Yeah. It's kind of surreal. I mean, we grew up having cousins over and my brother's watching you fight. And I remember just the black shoes, black shorts, nothing else walking out like the coolest, baddest motherfucker around. And, and we loved It. So are you nervous for Jake? Fuck yeah. It's a fight. And this the baddest motherfucker on the planet, so Yeah. Hell yeah.


Ever. Any, Any, anything you wanna say to Mike? Maybe. Maybe ask him not to hurt. Jake, you Gonna be okay? I Be one please. you know, one Piece. Here's a question. So Jake sit out there ten three minute rounds. Is that gonna happen or No? No, it's gonna be two minute rounds. Okay. We're gonna have more action. Yeah. It's gonna Be fast. I do like that theory. It's gonna be faster. It's good for social media. Yeah. Yeah. It's good for the whole game. Yeah. The whole game. Is this a proud moment for you, Mr. gp? It's, it's a surreal moment. I mean, if I would've looked 30 years ago and said my son, one of my sons are gonna be fighting Mike Tyson, Mike Tyson. I'd be like, what the fuck you talking about? Hey, listen. Not at all. Your other son fought Floyd Mayweather right?


As well. I used to know this. You heard Floyd Nose? Oh, You know, like during the fight when he was holding his nose, he was going like rubbing his nose. You hurting the floor nose. You said that right? You I did. I I popped his eardrum as well. I heard, yeah. Got him on the ear once. Solid punch. He got him good. And I'm not, I'm not even as, as good as Jake. So just protect yourself, Mike, at All times. Please, Mike, at all times. So what else do you think about this? No, no, no, no. Here here's, here's one thing. Here's one thing that I have to commend you for. 'cause it's so cool. Obviously just like being in the entertainment space and athletics. I think sport is included in that longevity and just maintaining relevancy for the longest amount of time that you can is the hardest thing to do, man.


You have, you've now spanned three, four generations of people. I've been around Jake obviously for all his fights. I show up to all of them. But there's never been one with this much excitement because between the two of you, you cover every generation. It is insane to watch. And, and, and people are branding this as potentially one of the biggest fights ever. I really think it, It could be Stop is the biggest fight. I, I think so. I think it could Be the biggest fight ever because Do You know how many people are gonna watch on Netflix for free? Listen, this is what this is all about. All these other fighters and all these other, this is all about jealousy. They wish they can do it. They can't. No.


This is very unique, unique circumstance. No, They can't do it. They then they're, they're, they're knocking it, making it claim that this is bullshit and all that. But they wish, they wish so bad. They were in that position for Sure what they wish so better. They could take care of their families the way We can, the way people yell our names, they wish that these world champions, no one knows their names. This is unprecedented. There's no blueprint for this. No. You guys are the first to do it. The first to do a, a live sporting event on one of the biggest streamers in The world. a Hundred percent You know. But you gotta think, you gotta count. McGregor and Floyd started it, you know, McGregor and Floyd, They did start the crossover. He started This shit. Yeah, that was, that was cool. But this is, this is still different, Mike.


'cause 'cause you're not behind a, a pay-per-view wall. So, so, so like mcg, McGregor and Floyd got I think between four and 5 million views. Dude, there's a chance 20 to 30 million people are watching this live. Which is, which is crazy because gotta Be more people than that. We gotta more, we gotta listen. There's a lot of people 20 listen, 20 million people, 30 million people. There's nothing as far as we talked about numbers in America and The world. We're gonna get more. We gonna break Record. It might actually be way, it might be we gonna Break record. It might, It might be, I feel it. I could feel it. The energy tells you the whole world was, This was, this was the biggest press conference I've ever seen do ever. And the most excitement. Jake couldn't get a word out 'cause everyone was booing him. Listen, this is something I learned early in life and I know it's not cool, but hate makes more money than love You know.


That's why I wanted to be the villain. I was the villain because everything kept coming. They wanted to see me get my ass. They wanted to see bad stuff happen and stuff. Then eventually you take everything they got to offer you. You're still standing. They love you. Yeah. But you gotta take that beating first. People wanna see how you handle a beating, how you respond. Like when he fought Fury, he took, he took it like a man. Yeah, he did. You know. He took it like a man. No complaints. Didn't complain. Never complain. And he's still moving. Yep. Speaking of that, what do you think about the Fury, Molly Mae breakup? It's been big News. Tell me about that. Over the past week. Oh Wow. What happened, Molly? One of the most loved relationships, Molly is on the I. don, look at Molly. That's a, that's a narcotic. Oh God. No, No, it's not the, no, no, no, no.


So actually I think they might have broke up because of his use of Molly to the honest with her, he's gonna fight soon. No, this is one of the most beloved couples in The world. Very sad. Especially in the uk. It's a very sad moment for the internet and for love as a whole. Listen to see these two split ways, what do you have to say? Oh, This is what you, no one cares, knows the pain. No, no one knows the pain of the heavyweight champion when he's alone. Got it. You know we see him. We You know. I saw, I saw him. Tell him we gotta tell Him. I saw him falling down in the street. Tyson Fury and stuff. You know. We beat ourselves up. We torment ourselves. Tell me something. You guys are gonna work. Whisper. Let's go.
