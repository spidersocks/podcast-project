We've always said, what's up? But I've not actually sat down And Got to have like any sort of real conversation with you. And. A part of me feels like bad about that. like I regret It. Because from What, I hear you're the best person on the planet. Number one Is What. They is What. They say he's the most. He is a positive force of nature. I, I, I, I. Before this episode even starts, this is going be one of the most important And amazing episodes that ever comes out. I'm just going set the expectations, right, Now. Because He is one of the most positive And amazing people that exists in this world. I have not met one person who knows this man that does not speak of him in the highest of nature.


And. That's gotta make You feel God. Knowing that It wasn't probably always The case. No dude, I'm honored because anybody who knew me before, like five years ago, would only shit on me. Yeah. They would just ve like, I hate that. Y'all love this guy. He's such a bad human. So. It's like to work my way from that Being. The situation, like when I used to walk in the rooms like It was instantly a downer. I felt the energy shift. like dogs didn't like me, kids didn't like me, cats didn't like me. like It was bad. Cats don't Got anyone. Yeah for Sure. Dude. And, So, Yeah. For people to say Yeah So. That means a lot. That. People speak highly. Do You think That That was actually 'cause I We can. A lot of the stuff That you're going say today we can relate to, which is cool, which is why I love to be sitting down with you.


Do You And, I You know you were going to the on the WWE side, but No You don't. Do you still, you don't t Know that because I wasn't, I wasn't, okay, fine. Do You, do You still believe That ever do And And? Have you learned Whether or not? That was actually true? Or was that something that your mind was telling You, Which that I wasn't going be nothing. That That when pe that when you walked in a room, people thought No, No, No, No. It was true. It was true. Man, because I, this is a true story. When I first Got outta jail, I, we stopped at the closest gas station, which is kind of just a trend of like, I wanna go get a whatever they have that I couldn't get. It's like freedom. Freedom, right? A gas station is like the epitome of freedom. When you're out jail. You're like, just since We can get whatever don don't even remember. I. Whatever candy they didn't have on commissary.


You, Know, And, I walked up. And this I. Swear. It's a true story. I'm standing at the counter, And, I've Got like $6 to buy whatever soda. I'm kidding. And something else. And a pack of cigarettes. And, this little girl, like maybe 2-year-old child just comes And, hugs my leg. Dog. I. Don't wanna get emotional this early on the podcast, but I, when I tell you, before That point, kids cried when I looked at him like dogs ran way from me. Like I was like, maybe It happened. I was like, maybe this shit that I'm telling myself that just happened in jail is really happening. Went, went, went home. I was with this chick. She had a dog. Dog loved me. Damn love me more. I mean swear, love me.


Ended up loving me more than her. It was like crazy. It's crazy. The cat loved me. It was fucking nuts. I'd wake up, the cat would be asleep on my face. It was totally different. Did the little girl confuse you for her father? No, No, No, No, No. I didn't look like nobody. Daddy We can tell You that. Dude So, nobody looks like you. No No. At that time, I was 24 years old. And. I looked like I was going to steal something. I definitely Let her What. Do you think It was about the time inside that What? How long was that stint? I did a couple years. Two. Two And. A half, maybe three. That time. What. Do You What? Do You think It was about That time? That that sh shifted the your appeal to others. Well. I. I had had a woman pregnant whenever I was free. So She had had the baby when I was born.


So, that was my daughters. That was the birth of Ooh. Ooh. Great parallel. Let's s go. Great parallel. So. This was my first child story. I was incarcerated. And. They knocked on my cell door. And told me that She was born. And You know It sounds crazy, but It was like a light switch happened in my head right then. That I was like, And. I. think It was the pressure of that moment. That caught me too. 'cause you're like, I'm worth like $32 in potato chips. And honey buns. That's like What. My life is worth And. like seven packets of paper. Three pens, six pair of boxers, five T-shirts, two jumpsuits. That's all I owned. One outfit with like a $10 bill in the pocket that I'd had hidden in a watch pocket that the police didn't confiscate when they arrested me.


That's all I had. And. I was like, And. I'm a father. And. I just like felt guilt. And I felt shame my whole life. And guilt. But never like this. And I was like, I gotta figure this out. And I immediately. I I went And Got my GED, while I was still in jail. I'd been in jail a year. And some change at That point. And had Don nothing but play poker. And get in trouble. And, imagine how they felt in that jail. When I woke up one day, It was like, I would like to go to the educational unit. And. They was like, Yeah fucking right. We're going bring You up. You've Don nothing but cause us a problem. I'm like, please sir, I'm a change man. They're like, And. I bet. God came. And seen you in your cell last night. I was like, He did. Can I have a kid's? A matter of fact, And. I wanna change And. That So, it's crazy. Talk about a disparity or, or difference between two like ways of come into That fatherhood.


But watch this though. Same feeling. Mm. He He knows. 'cause I just iterated. We did It That on the last podcast. I I. You can, you don't understand until It happens. And I was trying to understand. 'cause everyone told me this is like, your life doesn't start until Now And. You. Know I feel like I had a life. Ooh, n Now I Don't So much Yeah. I've been saying Fuck the next chapter. This is a new book That's It It this Is it is dad mode Com. It's a complete shift. Do You feel like you owe your life to your daughter because of the way She affected yours? Oh one hundred percent man. But I owe, but I I What You know as a father is That.


We We owe our life to our children anyways. Mm. But especially the way She affected mine. You know, What I mean. But We can also tell you That, the biggest curse We can give our children is an unlived life of our own. Mm. So always keep That in mind too. While you're doing the balancing act of Being Super Dad, but also Being, super Superman, Yeah, you know, What I mean That. sometimes Clark Kent had to at list had to exist as Superman could. Do you think She was the catalyst for, for the shift in you It. It sounds like that was like the thing And It was for Sure her really? One hundred percent. Her It was like immediately like, okay, I gotta start applying these thing So. Then I'm also curious because you know, It, It, What, you're describing let's s go, let's say, what's her name?


Bailey Pre Bailey And Post Bailey Yeah Are. like two different versions of yourself. One Hundred percent And. And. Just hearing you. Now It sounds like the pre Bailey, pre Bailey version of yourself was resonating at like a low frequency And And, And And dare I say negative aura 12. But the speed Going just pop out from God couch, right? Now He Look at my, but it's like you Know l Riz type of shit. But, but, but, but You know that That That can be felt that you energy's contagious. And And And do was It as simple as flipping that switch where you Know Now like a random little girl's come up, And hugging your leg like It can It It can be felt is What.


I'm saying It It resonates. It can be felt by other people like animals, dogs. You're, you're, you're mentioning Yeah, And, And Well I did a lot of work too. Mm. you know, I describe It as a light switch moment. But man, it's been tons of work. That went into That moment, right? like the moment That was the moment that made me go I wanna change? Okay, And. That was, but the work after that, boy I mean It was a, It was a barefoot race up a glass. He You know What I mean. But He He, The number of analogies he's s going have is going blow your mind. Really? He told me when I met him at, at Summer Slam for the first time, right? Is that What It was in in Cleveland. He said It used to be So bad. I could walk. It, It could be It, could be raining.


It could be raining. Pussy And not get hit by a pecker. That's true too. That was my luck For longest. And Now. we can Now, we can run blindfolded into a forest. And not run into a tree. Yes, sir. Because that's how much his life has changed. And. See, the stuffy It takes me a second to Rece. 'cause of all the cracks moving there. It's real Now. But You can recall It for Sure. That's but think, think I. think listen. We'll, we'll talk about It So many thing today. But think, think more than anything. You. Are an example of comeback. Yeah. And of redemption for Sure. And. You Know, obviously, that's something. That I pride in myself a lot to And And. Hearing, hearing a story about having your child Well incarcerated to the average ear.


Seems like a wild way to have a kid. But it's actually a story. That probably happens quite often to a lot of people out there. Oh, Yeah, And. think, think that you've become a, a symbol, And an icon to those people that they can, that they can achieve greatness. I mean I, Look, at the past week of your life, you're sitting here with us today, You did Saturday, Saturday Night Live on Saturday. Yes, sir. Insane Yes. Sir, you're on Fallon last night. You're touring every night everywhere South MSG. Friday, the Friday before Saturday sold out. Crazy, crazy week. I Got a show tonight. I'm living here. The show could You, ev I. Don't even have to ask this. Could you ever have imagined No? Goodness, No. I've been joking about this all week long with people. 'cause somebody at Saturday night last said, was this your dream?


And I was like, who is So cocky that they dreamed they, we can be on Saturday Night Live? Yeah, like I wasn't brave enough to dream of Being on Saturday Night Live. I St. It. First the idea That I could even do It didn't hit my radar until this year. You know. Does that make sense? Yeah And. Then It was like, even, even if you'd have told me last January, You might do Saturday Night Live this fall, I'd ve like, ha ha. you know, What I mean this year. I was like Oh. Really? This could be a thing. you know, So, Yeah, Dude, I never even dreamed I would. I was We were leaving Central Park. And. I. I put I posted this somewhere. We were leaving Central Park, going to Saturday Night Live. We had a police escort. I just played global citizen And. I'd Don, MSG the night before And.


I was like, It was a moment where you're like, what's really happening? right? Now like, this is different. This is not, you know, this is not normal. This is not normal for us. So. Yeah. I've had the best weekend ever. Dude, thanks for bringing It up. It sounds Like great weekend. Congratulations. Thank you for that is fucking awesome. And. It's It. Is So cool? It's So crazy. 'cause like, when I Look at my And, like I, I I. think prob probably most people like you, You, you fit. You're, you're re right where you belong. And. I mean, I mean that like, I, I, I, I. think like when I see creators. Artists kind of like pop up. And, I, I, I, I. I'll definitely say like you, you popped up on everyone's radar. like pretty recently. I was like Yeah, like I don, you know, It was a familiarity.


That re right, that I felt And It to me. It seems obvious that you're in this position that to You maybe wasn't So obvious. At, at some points. It's like You obviously have the talent. You have the look, you have the charisma And energy. But why didn't you see It? Mm. I think I was still struggling to see past who I was, not who I am. I kept kidding, stuck in this like, shame spiral of just not Being able to find my way out of who I was. And It. There were So many thing That I had to go through to start breaking those little patterns. like I was thinking about It when We were following the police. I was like, even my relationship with law enforcement.


It took a long time to like I love police Now. like, when I see 'em at my show, like they hug me. I hug themed. I started collecting their challenge coins. think, think it's cool. I have a wall dedicated to It. think, think it's So. Cool That. They give me these challenge coins. you know, Know, it's like Coin. I was literally a decade. You Know 14 years ago. You know I mean I. think I owned a fuck the police shirt. Yeah. You Know What. I mean Yeah. It's like I was So against I had to change So. Many different I had to Look at everything of life. Logan differently. Bubba I mean And. A lot of people who haven't experienced That don't get It. think, think that's one of our kinships is I. I'm sure you were the same like I.


Can't Look at I mean how I I wiped my ass wrong. I, did you know What? I'm saying like, I was just, just did everything I to seems I had really It. All It seems Different. It seems like a different life. Now. It's a totally different world. And, And, And He asked you about, or, or You were just speaking about like having trouble re forgetting It, Yeah, And I. I was going ask you, you know, to tap on Top Tack on Top of that. How do you practice making sure you fucking remember It? Mm. Because because I'll have days where I'm, where I'm I. Get in a fight.

And I. Forget That. The last You Know. Exactly. What You said 14 years ago, I was driving a 1996 Ford Escape to the gas station.


And putting a dollar 26 in the gas tank. Yeah You. Remember putting fucking less than $2 in the gas tank, how shitty That felt knowing That. You We can have to try to figure out how to find not dollar to put in the gas tank to get to the methadone clinic. This Is even deeper than just a dollar 60. If you've ever been in a place in life where You put a certain number in the gas tank, you know, What, I mean like I didn't I. Remember, the first symbol of success for me was the first time I swiped a debit card. And was like, I'm going Let, That. Motherfucker. go, you know, What, I'm saying like, ha ha, And I. Remember watching It the whole time, but Chief clinched a little bit. You Know, What. I'm saying stomach still tilting And. I had a little money in a bank by then, but I was still like, Ooh, It takes $80 to fill this trick.


I would've never known. Yeah. I've Yeah, I've only Don 50 at a time. You Know, What. I'm saying So, like those were the moments. And, Yeah come from those moments. You're re right though, but you, something else I had to learn was identifying emotions. Because my first problem was one, there is a space like Recentering yourself. And your gratitude in That moment of like, why am I tripping out on my assistant? This is my life. This is unrealistic, right? Where It took me a long enough to just go It. What was the root of the problem, right? Because for me, It just always was anger. It didn't matter. What, It was No matter. What happened. It triggered an anger. And. Then I would ruminate in It. And. I would just get angrier. And. I would just get madder. And madder. And. I would fester.


And, just spiral. And. Just It was just a, the never ending. So, I still have those days where I have to re-anchor. But Now, I'm just more honest. Now, And, I. Wake up, And, be an asshole. Some mornings And. Then double back. And. ve like, Hey, man, my bad. I just did that. I just rectified This morning. Yeah, it's like, like sent a text message like, Yeah, No, I have to I, have to do It all the time because What I've learned is I. Hate to go back to like cliche shit, but halt, hangry, angry, Yeah, lonely, tired, Yeah. you know, What, I mean. It's like All We Got a bunch of drug. I've never heard that. wait, We, God, a bunch of shit. Yeah. That's Amazing. Yeah. don, I'm tired. Yeah. That's big. Halt. Pause. Halt, Pause, bro. You tired. That's Actually, that's awesome. Hal don, just tired. That's you.


Find yourself kidding. A little snappy or like not feeling something the right way. And You. Halt. Hold on. Am I hangry? Am I hang. Am I hungry? Am I angry? You, keep combining. Am I lonely? Yeah? Am I lonely? Am I tired? you know, What, I mean And. I started like having just little thing like that. Just, just hit him like a lot of the time. For me, it's tired. You Know my dude. My dude knows I'm a bear if I'm super tired. But I also know that my food addiction kicks in when I'm the tiredest. When I'm the most tired is when I crave the most. The most food is when I can't fill myself up. When I'm tired. When I wanna go have a drink, when it's, when I wanna do cocaine, And, it's don. My most vulnerable Keeps you tired. Mm. Because when you try to sleep after You eat or You drink, your sleep suffers.


Ooh. not why you, why you're digesting food. You're fucking your whole system up. So. You, you just God that downward spiral That You described earlier is That can happen pretty easily. And I, I. think Being aware of That For someone like You who's like, you know, You. You lived. It is I mean. That's So important. Yeah for Sure. Because then you can stop It. You can halt. That's It. We can halt. we can go. All right. What, What am I tripping about Yeah. You know, What I mean. Yep. Now, admittedly, sometimes I should have halted four hours, bro. Yeah, you know, What, I'm saying I'll be five. I'll be a full, I'll be three days into a need of a halt. Yeah. Know. you know, What. I'm saying four hours. You're in court. And, You're like, Oh. They're like It too late. It's like, hold on. I was just hungry. And tired. Well. Especially this lifestyle. You're living Now as You, Know Yeah.


You can do It a Lot. This is So God. But already this is What I. Hope this would be, is real shit, bro. We, there's So Much like, Ooh. I was like, yay. I was going Ask you You wa You walked in with, with Miles. Yes. Acocks. 'cause you, you've been talking to ongoing work. You've been talking. You said, halt Yes. kidding. In tune with your emotions. And I wanted to ask you how much of that is continuing to come in. I, I bring up Miles because I just went to onsite. Yes, Yes life changing Man. I had a real serendipitous journey there, bro. like, like I, don't I told miles about It. But some crazy shit happened on the way. And, I'll give You the abridged version, but not singer from LA had told me about on Onsite, which is this, this magical retreat in, in the hills north of Nashville, which, which works on addressing trauma.


People that Are hurt, which a lot of us Are. All of us. Are. She told me about It. I put It in the bag for two weeks. I see You at summer. Slam It came up in conversation. She said, brother That place saved my life. True story. Two weeks after That I bring up Carl Lentz, pastor Carl Lz, who we had on the show four years ago. I brought him up in conversation with my girlfriend. not one hour after I brought him up. After not seeing him for four He, four years, He appeared before me. Whoa He appeared before me at the Rosewood in Montecito. I was having lunch with my girlfriend, I brought up on onsite to him. He said, brother, that place saved my life. Mm, Actually, yep. Verbatim, He said, save my marriage. He said, fix, fixed a lot of thing that I was working on. Wow. True store. I left that I flew to Miami. And went to a Church called Vu Church in Miami.


Pastor Wilkerson sent him a message how great his, his sermon was, which It was a sermon on healing. And. The importance of healing. Maybe you're not, maybe you're not evil. Maybe you're just empty. And, You need something to fill It up. You need Christ to fill It up. I sent him a message. I said, Hey, your sermon was very powerful. I, appreciate That. He said, how long Are you in Miami for? I said, till Thursday. He said, Oh, I'm cool. I'm going Nashville on Thursday. I said, I'm going to Nashville on Thursday. What flight, do you on He, said, 1:37 PM American I said, What seat. Are you in No way. Two A. Two B I was seated right next to him. What on the way to onsite Oh in which I said to him, Hey, I'm going onsite. He said, I've heard great thing about that place. Yes.


It saved a lot of lives. And, He, And before Oh God off the plane to go to onsite And, drive the hour from the airport to the place He prayed. He said a prayer for me. The, he's an incredible man. Pastor Wilkerson Jr. Out of v Church, So, all of these serendipitous thing led to me, met me to Han onsite. You Being a a part of It And. I had an incredible experience there. I Got to do equine therapy with horses. And learn how to be present in the moment because horses don't allow you to be not present. There's a massive animal next to You. Yeah, who a few D days. Who knows, right? That's, that's a wildest animal by the way. hundred percent. It's just, lemme tell You something about horses. They're, they're all wild. Even the ones that Are, they're just tame. Doesn't mean they're not a wild horse.


They're just, they have agreed to Let. You do this right? But it's an agreement. It's s not that's What makes horses So special. You also heard about their heart size too. Four times the size of the humans, right? Incredible. Touching on that, kind of like this serendipitous nature of like signs. If you want to call It, like the, the universe speaking to you, Are you at all in touch with that kind of ether, Yeah, Yeah, What, What. He was just saying, I was going say, that whole journey of his, to me sounds like the Alchemist Yeah, right? It's like the idea that when He went all this way out of his way to find out What, He really needed was behind him. He didn't hit a closed door on the way home. you know, What, I mean. It's like, you know, it's that, it's that thing of like, when we're doing right, the universe conspires for us.


I truly believe. I'm telling you, I hit nothing but brick walls my entire life. I have not ran into a closed door in 36 months. God, bless you. And I. Hope It stays that way. Because as someone who has had both And, you mentioned in the, in the beginning of this podcast, that everyone hated you. And. don don't know if you were joking or if you were serious. I was dead serious. So, Now. Everyone loves you. And. I've had the opposite journey. Everyone loves me. And, Now. They hate me of No. not, but So. So So. My, you've only gotten Smarter, brother. That's It Yeah. That which is, which is So. True. you know, And, And, don And. I'm partially Being facetious, but not because the more I simply exist, the more people know about me, which gives themed the opportunity to choose What they like or don't like.


And, And, I have had the ups, And the Downs, And, the doors have been hitting me, dude. And also, I've been running through the fucking doors, right? right. It goes both ways. So, it's sort of a question And, like It feels. I'm not going give You advice 'cause You already know this man. But like, truly cherish the positive moments where there isn't a worry in The world. And, The world is blessing you. 'cause there may be a day, as you know, where like You do, have That feeling again, of, of, or whatever. It is impending dread doom. Are, Are. You prepared for That. Are. You just trying to stay positive about It. Are, you aware that You know? 'cause let's, let's be real, Mr. Roll. can I call you that Oh Prefer Jelly, but I, come on your podcast You know It.


Let's be real Jelly like, man, God thing can be stripped from you in a second. In one second. And, like, I've had It happen. How do You, We, we have built in defense mechanisms For that No. Serious. Seriously. like, Like, like way of prison. And, drug addiction. What. You guys Yeah. It's just, it's just, they take way. The we not to speak for you, but we've been in the gutter. like Actually So, And, And, And, And, And You. know And t Know. You don't wanna go back because You know What. It's like No For Sure. And also like, man, make No mistake. Shit's falling apart from me every day. When I say I haven't hit a closed door. I mean it's just the faith. I'm just still walking in the right direction, knowing What What. It's worth And shit. I get shit kicked in my face every day. That's part of It, right?


And, I, I. I'm honest with people to tell You that I I wake up in the morning. And. I have to spend real time fighting a monster inside of me, loving a very dark one. like I have to wrestle this guy And. Really, really, really get into my prayer closet. And my faith. And my wife, And. Communicate. And. And. Be vulnerable. This is before I. Pick up the phone. you know, What I mean like, like, know That about me, because you know that if I don't, you know, What, I mean, you know the risk. That I am to myself, And other people. So. It's like, trust me. It's just the way that I approach It t Know. Listen, I, I'll give you the most recent example, but once again, how the universe still worked. My dream was not my dream.


Once they gave me Saturday Night Live, I was like, yo, A skit is going mean as much to me as singing. like, that's the big deal. That's the chance. the show that I'm more than a singer. It could open up a thousand other doors. This is the biggest program ever. This is Saturday Night Fucking Live. We're there Friday And. They go Got You in a skit. Colin wrote It. I'm like, Oh.

Let's s go. you know, What, I'm saying So. It's like, even if the skit wouldn't have God seen. It was a small W for me. Yep, you Know, What, I mean. But it's like, I'm just those. I'm just learning how to pivot. And Look at 'em different. It's also about how I started looking at thing. I started looking at thing through the lens of love. Man, sometimes you can run into the door. And. You just gotta Look at the door. And go What You. know What What. Where's the love at in this And? As long as We can find the love in It, we can take any shitty situation to figure It out. You have Haters? Of course. Fuck dude. I'm a fat Dude. Watch the come. It's s going happen. Yeah.

Let's, let's collapse. you know, What, I'm Saying that's What. I tell MGK all the time. I'm like, you're fashionable. I'm not. I'm fat. And frumpy. You're tall. And, skinny. And. Cute. And. That's fucking how we connect. Because they hate You for That. They hate me for this. You guys. You guys didn't always connect. No, No, No, No. No. I was a hater because you Okay?

And. I was like, Hey man, I, think That. You haven't maybe executed telling your story the right way. I was like, I. think you've allowed the art to do all the talking. And, the headlines. And the art's. Incredible. And, we get It, but You, Know between the fashion, And the headlines. It kind of You, Know. I was like, if people knew your soul, And, the change you've had, And the man you've become. I was like, I. think the whole world would Look at you. you know, different as if you're not wildly successful anyways. like y'all's pod. like how vulnerable, like how That honest To see that in him. That's What. ve like kind of You Know. What is What. We hoping He would do when He came on. And He did. It's, it's I. When You tell your story for the first time, I think it's, it's I. I. I would say, I. think he was a bit nervous.


I I was going say this. I still don't think The world has really seen Colson, Yeah. No. not like, not like, not the Way we like Well. He's just starting to chip the surface though. He's just Now kidding. Comfortable enough sitting here. And having long form conversations. 'cause you've hung out with him. like I have I love him. He's The sweetest. He's funniest dude ever. He's also go, He's The goofiest. He. go And. He's So. He's hilarious. He's hilarious. And, you, Know. What. I. think It is I. think the industry that he's in, like white hiphop artists. If you don't appear a little jaded, And a little hard. I. Wonder if I, wonder if in in his head, maybe That, maybe that would, people's perception of him may change. And. I. think that I don. ve like don. Don't know. I. Don't wanna say It's Well in the hatred. And the hatred too. No. It's starting to happen. It's starting to happen though.


The you, you can feel the the thing come to And. There's also just a little bit of Cleveland in themed for Sure. It's like a little bit of you. Y'all Got a little. Fuck you in y'all. Oh for Sure.

That's Chaos. You Know, And, And, And. You're, you're lucky that I. Don't You. Know. I, I. That happened to me. I, I. think I'm like at least Now, especially like relatively normal in real life. 'cause I'm a dad. And stuff, because I've been humbled, right? like really humbled. And, I. I've, I've taken That as an opportunity to like become a person again. Which ve like And, And, And, And. That's certainly why, why you And Colson I. think Are partial buddies.


Yeah. My Well. My heart. My heart hurts For guys like you. And. Kels for a little bit of this reason of I was afforded the luxury of Beca. My hardships were an advantage in the aspect of I was afforded the luxury of I. Didn't have to do all my growing in front of everybody. Wow. For Sure. Same way. You Yeah, You, Know, What. I mean like, it's like, you know, like we've had to really watch like from, I've been watching Kels this whole career. Mm. I've been watching most of yours. I was like, like said I started on YouTube. My first thing I ever uploaded song wise, any platform was on YouTube. I was a YouTube kid. What, What. Year Two thou. My daughter's 16 So. This was 15 years ago. 2009 started So Bad Nine Yeah Yeah.


That's, that's generation one, Basically. Yeah, I'm thinking Oh eight, Oh nine, Yeah. I'll put It to you this way. I put up a pro. You're going get this. A lot of people don't. And. I'm going pop quiz let's s go. But the first thing I ever uploaded on YouTube was called the 10 minute freestyle. can You. Guess why It was 10 minutes, Probably had a max duration. Yes, Sir Yeah, nobody gets that back then. YouTube would only let a 10 minute And 17 second video go up. Yes. We called It the 10 minute freestyle. But It was really 10 minutes And, 17 seconds. We had a 25 minute. Did It just end Yeah? We just Yeah I. 10 17 It just stopped Well. We just, we were chopping It up. And at 10 17. It just hard out Yeah for Sure. Yeah. Dude, I'm So curious about your talent. Talent. Talent in general kind of makes me really curious because you You very clearly have a God given talent.


Singers, specifically artists. you know, you're, you're born with your voice sounding a certain way. That, that appeals to a lot of people. How, how I guess without Being a fucking, a dickhead with a talent like yours. How did you not become successful sooner? Oh. I was, I was in the wrong. I was in the I was in the right room with the wrong furniture. That was the problem. I was, I was writing the right kind of songs. I was saying the right thing. I've been consistent in my message. And, who I am for a decade. Now, right? This has been the better part of my last, especially eight years since I, Got married. That really was the beginning of me. like Being, like I want to get together.


'cause like, real level, just have you like, wanna change thing. You Know. What I mean. Yep, And. I just couldn't. I just started And. I kept feeling It. kidding, closer And. Then the furniture started. kidding, right? But I was always in the right room. I think It was Save Me was the beginning of It I put a song on YouTube called Save Me. That went pretty viral. And It was the first song where I was like a super slow six, eight ballad of me just belting the struggles of pain. You know, What, I mean just like ass cheeks. Clenched just screaming my soul out. And. I'd never put a song out like That And It. That man It just instantly went And I was like, man, this is 'cause this was the kind of songs. I was writing, And recording, but not putting on my albums. Yeah I had like songs like this.


That I was just not putting out, you know, What. I mean I was like, Oh my God. All right, Well cool. People accept this kinda honest vulnerability. I'm in So. That's, that's kind of where It was. It was crazy. I was just, just couldn't figure out the furniture Fair. How do you handle the fame? I don't feel famous. don don't feel I. Listen, when I was in Antioch, everybody knew me. don from a small neighborhood, everybody knew everybody. But I just run around And. People say, Hey, jelly. It's nothing like And. Equally, I've been blessed to have friends like, like Dwayne Johnson who was famous. you know, I I was blessed to work with guys like MGK, And, Eminem, they're famous So. When I Look at me, I'm like, Luke Combs is famous.


Jelly Roll is not famous. Garth Brooks famous Jelly Roll, not famous Yeah, Yeah, you know, What. I'm saying Thats all relative, right? like Yeah, but Alright. right. When You Look at It, like if you're comparing yourself to Dwayne Johnson Yeah, none of us Are famous, right? But like, but like, dude, you're, you're, you're obviously like super identifiable. You Got, face tats You know, like, like my brother for example, walks around big beard tattoos like You You know. That's Jake Paul Yeah. It's, it's hard to not see him And similar with you. It's like you're, you're very clearly like this entity. You're famous Brother Yeah, you're famous. And, I, And. you know, you felt the life change. like people approach you in the street for Sure Jelly Roll. can I get a picture? Yeah, but it's just like a bigger Antioch. Just, it's just a bigger neighborhood. Everybody knows You Now, but it's just a bigger Neighborhood because I think I've been blessed.


That. The people that do speak to me make me feel that way. like, nobody comes up to me. Weird. They're always like, what's up Jelly It just makes me feel like I'm at, at Home. Yeah, that's, but it's because of who? You. Are. Yeah. Yeah, It Yeah. It's because you're, it's 'cause you're, you're real And. Authentic And. You talk about Dude, there's nothing more Entertainment's. Entertainment. People love to watch Dwayne Johnson. They love to watch a movie. They love to, you know, And, he's God And. He's God struggles. I'm not trying to discount those. But there's nothing more relatable to people that will make themed want to come up. And hug you more than knowing one That you that you go through or went through the shit that they do. right? That's the most beautiful, that's the best thing that I've taken outta this whole experience. Putting out the fifth vital, having people come up to me crying. And, Being like Oh I. Understand addiction. I, understand heroin, Now I understand why my mom took her life.


Mm. like all that shit. That's, that's What gets me. It's s not like Oh, I saw you made this joke, or You worked with this person. You Know, What. I'm saying That, authentic. Relatability is the most beautiful thing. Yeah in The world. And like even sitting here with You, like a lot of the shit you're talking to is stuff I. Wanna know more about And. There's people out there that wanna know more about It. like, like That monster. That You fight every morning. Yeah. Who is He? What? Do And. And more? And Most importantly What. Do What. Do you do? What's your What? Does your morning look like So That? Maybe they could replicate It. Well. It starts with I had to get way from the electronics in the morning. like, It was like Oh, God in this bad habit. I, don't know if y'all do It. Maybe y'all Are already smarter than me, but I would wake straight up.


And, grab my phone, wake up, pick the phone up. hundred percent. And. I tell you, What, it's, it's a gamble. 'cause there's very seldom great news on there, right? It's always, it's life kicking us in the face. And don don't know about y'all, but my phone s go Phoneless about six months a year because my phone is just a benevolence box. It's just, it's just people, it's just a request line, right? That's just It, So, I. Once I identified that What, do you mean That? You know, it's just people wanting stuff. Okay. you know, What, I mean, it's like, it's just how That works, right? So, but you Know how It works, right? I'm not Being fake here. No not, not at All. like, if someone wants something from me, they don't have my number. Yeah Yeah. like No. It shouldn't ve like that if I'm working on That, but it's like I'm just still So compassionate. And. I. Just I. It's a I. Have a bad relationship with my phone.


So don. Just, I'm So bad with It. I either won't have one or overly have one. It's my addictive personality anyways. It's like right Now. I've, I've lost a hundred pounds this year 'cause I'm just obsessed with kidding my fucking weight. And health together. Wow. God for you. you know, What I mean. But equally, I'm also, this, the flip side of That personality is I've had a year that I gained a hundred pounds before. You. Know. What I mean So. It's like You Know. I'm constantly fighting that So. sometimes in the morning, I'm just I. Wake up And, just kind of get in my own head. Gratitude list early. First thing. You're probably very familiar with this process. Are You. Familiar with the gratitudes in the mornings. Don I. I say gratitude prayers every night. But I'm not, right? I'm not, I'm not familiar with this. I love a gratitude prayer though.


I get It So in the morning. like, I'll don something about me writing still 'cause I guess don songwriter in me. I want to write stuff? Yep. So. I'll still wake up And write like, just basic like, man, I'm grateful I woke up next to my wife this morning. you know, What I mean like, like early in the morning, I'm sowing themed seeds of gratitude. That's because if I don't, I might walk right out here. Got a busy schedule. Didn't get my stuff together. I didn't get my gratitude. Listen, I didn't get a cold plunge in I, didn't get to pray. I didn't get to spend a few minutes with myself. you know, What, I mean I didn't get to hug on my dog. My dog makes me happy. Yeah for Sure. You Know, What. I'm saying for Sure. for Sure. It's like, like just And. Then I find myself yelling at my guy. you know, What, I'm saying Yeah upset. 'cause He fumbled the ball on something small. Yeah. Yep. you know, What I mean.


It's like where if I So I try to get up. And I kill that guy. And I also, man, between us I don, you know, if I wanna go That deep, but I I still have to fight the like, do I want to get up some days? You know, What I mean like And. It sucks because don have purpose. Finally, I'm useful. I'm everything I ever prayed for. I've Got financial security. I've Got everything I've wanted. And I still wake up some days. And have to ve like I don, you know, Can, we can relate to that for Sure. And. It's And. It's such a wild animal for people out there to, to understand that.


Don't understand It, you Know. It's just such a, it's such a paradox because you Look at someone who's successful. God the wife, God the family, God the money. And wonder, how is That not enough? We We We. I see It all the time with people talking to mic on, on social media. Oh, You have depression. No, you don't go to the gym. Yeah, go to the gym. eat, eat better. I'm not saying those thing aren't going help you And. They Do. They They do. They they do get loved ones around you. Get in network, Get out. You get in network, get in the sun. But bro, I gotta get out bed to do that for Sure. And. That's What I. Tell people to say don And, then nobody's in there to pull me out of That bed.


Nobody's in there to drag me to That gym. And, And, And I have to fight that Dude. That's the Dude. I have to fight. 'cause That Dude That Dude. That dude is scary. You Know, What I mean that Dude scares me. And, that's the demon. That's the monster. But I've learned I mean, I've, I've, I've been working towards fighting this Dude for years. you know, What I mean And. I'm winning a lot more than I've ever won. I'm kind of kicking his fucking ass. You kicking his As you know, What, I mean I'm kicking his fucking as his As. But you know, What, I mean. But I had to realize, That, this was a real thing in my life. you know, What, I Mean That. Do Know. How important you know this to understand how important this conversation is. Oh, Yeah, like, like, it's just such a, like, I'm So happy I hate that You had to have this moment because I hate that you're going through pain.


But this is just such a necessary moment. It's like something that I've always aspired to talk about too. like that feeling of dread, of not feeling okay. No matter how okay thing seem around me. Oh, you, Know, What. I'm saying that Being, okay, And, That, Being. Something that can be worked on Oh. Yeah. Question for you Or Now. The, the, the idea of, you know, just fucking Now. You Got something, you're like God, I. Don't wanna fuck It up Other Shit. not Now. That's a whole new problem's. like, bro, like I never knew the pressure. That would come with just Being. like Whoa man. I have So. Many people that count on me, not completely fucking And don don't know about y'all. I, Got a history of fucking shit up. That's, I've God a long history of like really blowing shit.


I can't relate, know What, I'm saying, right? Can't relate. It's like I've God a history of blowing It, You, Know, What. I mean that's s going be one of the hardest thing that's s going be one of the hardest thing to give up. Your man, your managers, you're going be, unless You work on that. I'm six years in Now. And every day feels like, bro, if I don't take this brand, if I don't do this deal today, if I don't do this show today, if don don't do this thing today, tomorrow it's over. I. See, It in here though. like, like, bro, that crack mental crackhead mentality. That like, yo, I gotta get my dose otherwise, yo, tomorrow this shit could all go down. Yeah. It's, you gotta put that thing way. And, I. I've tried to, I've tried to get to a point where like, yo, the shit that I'm working on has strategic value. And, I'm doing real work.


But it's, that's that drug mentality. Yeah. And, that's And, that's What. I I. Kind of wanna ask You about too. I did, I did a round table yesterday with, with Bobby Kennedy in Philly. Oh dope And a And, a number of other people to talk about the rolling out of a, a strategy to get addicts back into the workforce. Which I, which I fucking love. We We. We as a country, Are suffering from a, from a GDP that isn't growing as fast as We need It to And. It's one of the reasons why we're not a competitive country, right? Now. Now, we've God you Know, hundreds, And hundreds, And, hundreds of thousands of very God people who need to be reformed into us, Right? Or at least some version of us You know What, I'm saying into And, these Are great people, they're not fucking scumbags, right?


like they get labeled as. We're not scumbags. Were people who Got lost along our way. And, Are Now, finding our way for Sure And I don't know about you, but one of the thing that you know, It was your daughter But for me, one of the thing, That gave me my first self-esteem to continue Being clean after Oh. God Clean was kidding a job. Yeah And, finding some self-esteem And a body that had never felt that ship before. Ooh, Tell him the job. I I was a dog walker. Oh And. Oh God that job, because it's Actually kind of therapeutic, though. The best thing Job It was actually by default Going, s going. go back to That. Yeah. right? And It was fucking awesome. Yeah. You're Going shoot a TV show About It, don. Sure. right? Yeah. Something like that. My older sister took, my older sister, took a chance on me. Yeah And introduced me to some people.


And She. And She took a real risk, bro. And brought me into a circle. That I did not deserve to be in, right. And I asked Bobby Kennedy yesterday. I said, how do we democratize What my older sister did for me? Mm. How do we get other business owners, other people to say these Are, these Are hard. You know how strong fucking addicts, Are, Yeah. If you're an addict, And, you're And. You're still working today. And. You're still here trying your best, bro. You're a, you're the strongest human on this planet, bro. Yeah. Because how much shit in this underworld, That people don't even know about? Bro. You Do You know about It? Oh Yeah in that world? That is, it's in the shadows, bro. That grind. That daily grind of just trying to survive every fucking day for years, I did.


It for eight plus years of just every day trying to just survive through the terrors. Bro, you, you, bro. You've, you told me you've, It's All shot at What. Whatever. Oh. Yeah. like everything, bro. All the horrors Yeah been, been, been, been through It. All my, my thing is too, though, is that It even expands past just hu like finding a way to get themed. Finding a way to give people purpose. Purpose. What really changed my life, was my, my daughter. It became purpose. And then music became purpose. And. Then as the music started helping people, 'cause I was writing these just sultry honest songs. The people were like, when people were seeing me in the streets, they wasn't going, Hey man, I bump your shit.


They were going, Hey, man, we listen to that song, And, my granny of my, my nephew's funeral. He overdosed. My cousin Got shot And. We played this song at his overpass. You know, What, I mean? like, I was kidding. These, these, like, I was like, then You start finding more purpose in moving in. That it's like anything for somebody is purpose. like kidding 'em a job. kidding. Somebody on the right track. kidding, kidding. Somebody. A place that they can up. Hobbies. God. Man. I. Remember the weirdest thing too, was man, I Got a problem. I had a problem too with my addiction. Whenever I was I, just addiction swapped. And went, And, put It all into this. like, Oh. I'm just going. The business was all that mattered. And. Then when I'd have downtime, the demons were come again.


You, Know, What. I mean. It was like, I was scared to go to sleep. That's where the ghosts were. You You know What. I mean It was That kind of thing. Yeah. 'cause, because I, there's a, there's this scene in Eufor. Did you watch Euphoria? the show? Did you gotta watch It? Really? It's such an incredible show. I have a teenage daughter. And I started to watch It. And. It immediately disgusted me. It Is it. Okay. I, I. I. Hear you. But watch if you get a chance to watch It as an adult without the And. And also Well. I didn't watch It with her. I meant like just having a teenage daughter, And, realizing that this underworld they created was supposed to be kids between 14 And. 19 I was like, But, but the problem Is. it is though. It's s not this fictitious world. It's No. It's s not like that. What. Do you mean I lived in? not, not, not. Its that it's exactly That. Is that true?


Yes? a hundred percent. Bro. can I don't wanna completely No No No No No. Euphoria can i's crazy. You can, you can't sweep sweep It Under the rock. It's a true story. It's happening in places For Sure Yeah Fair. Anyways, regardless, there's a scene in, there's a scene in euphoria with the, the main, with Zendaya's character Rue, who says, the first time She did drugs was the first time that She felt safe in her own head. Mm. It's the only time She felt safe in her own head. And I, And I. That I, Got Goose. I saw the scene. And immediately. God goosebumps, bro. 'cause It brought me back to, to sniffing Oxycontin. And thinking to myself like, wow. like all That shit went way. You know, What, I'm saying So is That the reason why I, you use drugs, I don't.


I've, I've always tried to track back What. It was for me, I. think It just was a tr cultural thing. like my, my father was a drinker. like I was in my late teens. I was in my early teens before I realized that vodka wasn't a sweetener. You, Know, What. I'm saying like, if you watched a man poured in a Stanley Thermo every day, You would eventually just ve like, this is sweet And love Yeah. You Know What. I'm saying it's like You. Don't think about It in a bad way. And. I love my father. He taught me more than anybody in my life. He's a great man. But He drank. You know, What, I mean, especially He. God. A little more sober ish later in life. But He was early. He drank. My mother did drugs. The neighbor did drugs. They smoked crack across the street. They smoked crack next door.


They smoke crack at the Top of the hill. They shot heroin. It was just happening. It's everywhere. So for me, It was just like, protocol. You're just like, you know, you're 12 years old. It's No big deal. You're smoking weed, 13 years old. You're taking alcohol, you're stealing pills out. Purses. You know What. I mean. That's S why I say Euphoria is Real. Yeah Yeah. I didn't t Know. I didn't. T Know. I grew up in White Lake. Westlake. Yeah. Listen, some Outside of Cleveland. I couldn't watch It 'cause don don't t Know one. I was afraid. It would trigger me.

But how do you You know What? I mean? But it's like T Know. They're drinking beer. And having bonfires For Sure. I mean We. Got. Got started with Oxy. Oh. God. We Got started with Oxys.


Early I mean And. It's still, It still happens. There's kids out there, 13, 14 years old doing all kinds of shit. Was that a product of your household though, from No? No. It wasn't So. This So. When did You start doing Drugs? When I was 16, I started using Oxys. Okay. I was introduced to 'em through pain because I had a lot of trauma. Broken bones, splenectomies, a ton of I. CU unit visits. I have a song called She. I. Hate to cut You off, but It go And. The song I wrote, it's Just talking to a young lady struggling with addiction. And. It goes, nobody ever saw It come. 'cause It started with a little pill. How crazy Yeah. Because yo, remember there was a time when our parents did pills. And pills were like, they weren't Oxycontin Dude.


like, that was the other thing that happened to me. They were like, Valium was like VCU value. not, Not, not to discount That. K Cuts, And shit. Exactly. But I was, I was, mine was also a product of location. The East Coast. God eaten bro. Yeah eat, eaten by Oxycon dude. Yeah, Vermont, Maine, Pennsylvania, Oh, Yeah like the, these states. Got. West Virginia, West Virginia, Yeah, All the way down into Kentucky. It hit Ohio. It was bad, decimated was bad. Decimated by Oxycon, by one company, And one pill with one brand name on It. Did You. Have you watched all the TV shows? Dopes, sick painkiller, all of It. I've watched all how dope. Sick was fucking incredible. So God, the guy who led the round, the round table yesterday, was the guy that Michael Keaton's character was based on. Really? In Dopes sick dope. God I should've went.


I couldn't. But It. It It was not, you'll You gotta come on the next one. Yeah. I mean Bobby Kennedy's Got. A God a God plan. But, but anyways. Also on the round table, yesterday was the coroner from, from one of the hardest hit areas in Pennsylvania. Because as You Know as someone who speaks out on Congress, wow. What the fuck Thank. you Bubba, To try to fend off Fentanyl. The death rate. The overdose death rate is insane. Talk about a topic. That is not Being discussed every day. We hear about Ukraine. We hear about Gaza. Major topics obviously super important. A bunch of other topics That happen in the States. If the trend continues within the next I.


think Bobby said. It's like within the next year, the number of dead Americans from overdose, since this epidemic began, we will surpass every American that has ever died in any war America has ever been fucking involved in. Mm, ever. world War I, Vietnam, world War War, ever, bro. How often is this topic Being talked about. Dude. You. You heard my knowledge. You. When I went in front of Congress, did you hear It? Logan? I didn't. It's a 7 37 plane a day Every day. Oh I did hear that every single I day, single I didn't see It Every single day. So, I make 300 people, right? So, I, quotes of It anywhere between 2 27 And, 300 people a day. So, it's like And. I looked And. I had That moment So.


My sister was helping me do the research for that speech. And, we were looking for like a comparison that would be the most jolting, you know, What, I mean of like, we were like, We. Were like comparing club sizes. You Know how you're thinking about stuff. You're like, how am s going present this in the most impactful way? And, when we realized that, when I realized It was a plane, I was like, you're telling me that's like of a plane crashed in America every single day? How many days would It happen before they grounded every flight in America? What's your prediction? Just ask outta curiosity. Two. Two. I. think it's two max I. think it's two max I. think maybe three. 'cause they have to go Are. We. Sure. right? That. A plane's crashing every day.


It's like It happened the last three days in a row. And. think, think they'd ve like ground themed And. Figure out What. The fuck's going on. At least that brand of p If It was a delta. Delta shutting down That day. Yeah. Yeah. It's like in our world, the way That, we have de human dehumanized drug addicts. Yep. And addiction is that America will literally step over their dead carcass. And go. They made That decision. And. I'm like, go watch dope sick talk to talk to Mike. A kid that was a straight shooting kid that was broke four bones in his body in tender age. And. They gave him a pill. You know What. I mean. It's, it's cra it's sickening I. I'm, I'm ignorant to this And. I'd like to ask a question. That, perhaps you guys could shed some light on, is like, why, why is That Being ignored?


like you, You You testified in front of Congress. And So, obviously, like at least the start of the conversation is Being had. But like, w why Are? We focused on such other don don't know petty shit. Yeah rather than focusing on the trauma traumatic stuff that's happening right here on our own soil Well. If We all came together to fix a problem, We wouldn't be fighting against each other, would We, No. No. You're So, right? Yeah. It's s not in No. It's s not in any, any of our government's best interest for us to all agree. That. We need to fix something. You know, What I mean because the day that happens, they've Got a big problem. The day that all It don't matter. What, the cause is the day that America actually agrees this problem needs to be fixed.


And, everybody agrees. Our government is in going be in fear. That problem can be saving geese. You get the entire country agreed to fix that one problem. It's s going scare our, they don't want It. They're not, they don't want It. They don't want I. Say that's s why We have a two party system. I say It all the time. It is the Do Know. Why they don't problem That. We have, as a country, is A two party system. Do You, do You, Know. why? They don't allow you to have comp competitive two person or two team sports in jail except basketball. Because they kill each other period. When you can't have a, because they Know That, if we put You in any sport, That involves y'all going against each other. Y'all Are going fight to the point. That, somebody's s going stab the other one in prison.


But we do It, but we do It as a country. This Is it as a country. It. You know, It's, it's, it's, it's gotta be one of the most mind boggling thing to me. Especially as you watch the inability of themed to ever even find any kind of unison, right? like, it's like And And, by the way. not only that, it's s not a disagreement. It's a desire to always make the other party look bad. Yeah I, liken It to a basketball game where both teams Are playing against each other. Neither of which Are trying to score both. Are just trying to block each other's shots. Yeah, And, the And, the American public is in the audience. Just yelling. Ah, I'm just over here. like, yo, let's just, you know, Yeah, That, And, I. think that's a part of the problem. And also think, think that we need to bring more light.


I, appreciate you Being, honest to go, Hey man, I'm ignorant to this issue. It seems like this is a problem. why don't we just fix It? That means a lot. Just more people like You. Being. like, okay, I'm in tune. Now. What is Well. Mike mentioned. Mike mentioned It earlier. like, okay, I, I'll be honest. Oh So. First off, I. I. Really appreciate your vulnerability. And, And, So does the viewer You the words That you've said today, just this far Are going, like really affect people's life. And. like, as someone who fuck it's emotional day for me a little bit. As someone who just tries to be impactful. You know, like your story, And your voice allows us to do That I.


think in a way where like, you Know our content. This this content specifically. It means something. It really means something. And Mike mentioned It earlier. like that demon you talk about That That that you fight, that You know He fights as Well. 'cause He iss my best friend, is not truly a struggle that I understand And, I have like failed to recognize like how, like how hard that can be for some people. Just because of like how you're wired. Yeah. You Know that. That's It. It. Just you Know, You, God You God, some neurons in your brain, That Are either over firing or not firing the right way. Some synapses, Are connected And mismatched crisscrossed like And, And And.


I was not wired like That And. It's I. I'm So grateful for It. But I've had tr trouble in the past empathizing with people who Are going through thing that I can't relate to. I think that sentence that I just said is the feeling of a lot of Americans. And, And of a lot of people who Are in control. That allow allows or where they're sort of enabling themselves to kind of turn the other direction. You Know, they don't understand It. They don't understand It, And, So A a, educating people. And, having these conversations is, is, is super important. But I think like I think our our our country in general struggle, struggles with like an empathy problem.


That's like an, that's a, that's a, it's like an evolved emotion. Yeah for a lot of people. It's true. Yeah, And, And, And, And, And, something. don don't, I'm not, I'm not trying to like Hyperly You, but your story is obviously So, like, can really positively influence a lot of people. So, I'm trying to like hear You And And take thing that That people can And And act in their lives to make a positive change. And, you have a, you have a self-awareness. And self-awareness is a, is a very attractive quality because like, bare minimum, you're aware of It, right? And you Know And to try to make sure that That car isn't going crash. To be able to identify certain thing about yourself.


And then put parameters in place that you, Know, You need to put in place. So. You don't do X, Y, z or regress to that That person. You don't want to ve like waking up in the morning. And, And, putting your phone way, way. That's an evolved person, right? That That That, that's something That is So important for people to do in their lives. But I think a lot of people aren't willing to put in that work. Mm. 'cause it's, it's Hard. It is work. It So hard for Sure. It's a, it's weird. It's hard. It's, it's always been weird to me too. With the empathy thing is like Is. it, it's A daily work too, by the way. Logan Yeah, it's s not just like a not the hard work is going through It, but still I mean. It's a daily work. What He was saying about empathy. And And I I agree with you a hundred percent.


I've always said is that empathy is a learned emotion. So, it's, it's s not easy for people to just magically have It I Got empathy. Because t Know What, it's like to wait in line for methadone And when it's 26 degrees. And. I have a jacket. And the person next to me doesn't, you know, What, I'm saying I Got empathy from Being. Have Being able to have a state's attorney when I went to court. And And having somebody do something nice to me. 'cause for me, 'cause they had a God. Attorney. Attorney, you know, What, I'm saying like those little trade offs. And passionate moments You have from living in That, That gutter for So. Long It It breeds It inside of You. The, the only reason I don't get It is because that That, some people don't understand the plight of addiction in the country. And, And would turn the other cheek is their mom's addicted. Their son's addicted. The kid next door is addicted.


Yeah, every bro substance abuse has touched fucking everybody, bro, in this country. So. It's just surprising to me that people Are still Well, That, I think that's s the thing. But it's also A testament to his honesty is That. That's not thing too is though that America's lost sight of taking the time to hear And care about what's happening with people. You Know What. I mean And. We just kinda automatically And And, And. I also get It too. 'cause Dude, we're all fighting life, man. Yeah Yeah, I get It. You know What. It's like to walk And. ve like, look, I'd like to stop And, try to have an opinion about That, but life's fucking me as much as it's fucking him. Yep. You Know What. I'm just saying True. True So. True You know don. It's So. True It. like it's So. True And. There's That, And, I.


think That. We've also, because there was a time in life, you only God news clippings. And spurts. So You only seen the bad side of America at like seven o'clock at night on the news Yeah. Or in that morning when you read your paper Now, it's like a nonstop funnel of all the fuckery that's happening all over The world all the time. On every single feed we have, Well, you, Know, What. It is, it's It. It's I mean. It's just shitty. But it's like, it's, it's innate in humans to be drawn towards negative stuff, right? I think it's a defense mechanism. Our species sees s thing that Are happening, that Are bad And, instinctively We. go I need to stay way from that Yeah You know about It.


Now I need to stay way from It. Yep. Oh, this Oh, this mugging happened in the street. And I. See this video in 4K of a security camera, And, it's horrible. And It affects me. And, I'm scared. Yeah, maybe I won't go out past 11:00 PM It It is sort of instinctual, like I I in many ways. you know, I always sit on this podcast And. I'm like, Well. Everyone just draw is drawn to the negative headlines. Negative headlines, right? You read headlines. like, but at the, in the same token, it's like He is how we're wired. We're just like, we're animals. We're actually animals. I love It. When Joe Rogan says, we're all a bunch of dumb apes, he's right. He's, he's right down the middle dude. It fucking It. Couldn't be more It. Hey. But you know, it's all about love though. My, my message mostly is that I, think That, What, You Whether. You have any connection with any of that stuff?


What you do have is You love people And. Then that'll end up bringing you around to compassion And Being more empathetic of those situations. I hate everybody just You asking And, having It Now starting to be that way. I hate everybody. No Don s not I. Don't hate everybody, but, but dude, People Are, hateable, I get t know What. don saying, don, I'm hateable. We're I. I mean like I. Get t you know, don s not, do you hate I I? Don don't hate a single. There's s not a single person i's s not not even hate. It's s not Don. You hate Yeah No, No I truly have I tell people all the time, anybody who don't like me anymore, it's one sided. Yeah, you Know don. Probably is that Weird. like I Just don't know. When I finally made It out of That shit, And Got free from It, And broke those chains. I was just like, Hey, I Apo. I'm sorry that everybody I did wrong too. To I hope. You accept It And. If You don't, then I get It.


But don I am Yeah. It's like, When's the last time You left a negative comment online? Oh. Dude, I've never I missed That. don Trying not even my mk post back, No No I just wrote a song about It instead, don don't think I'd never could comment. I probably sent mean dms instead. Hey, this, it's important That That people like You Are leading the Charge And. I'll throw myself into the, into It as Well for, for this topic. Prior to, prior to us And, And I asked you about It before the show. I'm an Imperfect, Addict, Yeah, I. think any God addict would say they Are too. But I mean It. Even, even less Perfect. I, I, I do some stuff that people in the AA community might not love.


Yeah, we talked about weed before. I love to gamble. Yeah love game. You know, What. I'm saying game I love game I love I. Do some stuff that is, that is that in the old school would be frowned upon Yeah. But I feel like the us Being authentically us. And, And, And, Being truthful about It. And transparent about It is allowing us to talk to a much larger set of people. Mm. Through, Through Being the opposite of a guru, right? I don't claim to be a guru on anything in this world besides cheeseburgers. But, but You, You, Are. You. Are not a scientist or a mental health professional. You Are a singer.


You Are a multifaceted, multi-talented performer who just So happens. t wanna that help in a place That He used to exist. And And continues to struggle in Yeah, And I. think That We Are. The evolution of OO of the program. That is going to help people For Sure I. First of all, I Thank you for Being. So nice to me. I'm a dumb songwriter. That sings right that Is it with nothing more. Dude, I have s a Sorry, level Litigation. You go s much. I'm a dumb songwriter. And I sing. And I I have So. Much respect for the sober community. And the clean community that I don't, don don't even claim that community at all.


As far as for me, Yeah I, Now I, participate, I attend. I'm a friend of Bill's. Billy Dubs. you know, What I mean Yeah. I'm a friend of Bill's Yeah. But, but, but I completely, when asked I never claimed to be in the space because I have So much respect for their model. Yep. I just also know that my mindset, the way What worked for me is been more of a harm reduction And, less of an abstinent model. But, 'cause I'll still smoke a little pot, a lot of pot. But frankly, if we're going be honest, it's a lot of reaper. But, you know, it's, but I have came really far from It And through It And. My thing is, my thing with everything And, this is What What, I'd like for the rest of The world to just maybe even open their hearts to, is that I believe there's space for multiple thing to be true at once.


I'm not married to just one school of thought about every single thing. You're going offend somebody. If you're talking to Nuance, evolve Are, You talking to Nuance, you're going offend. you know, youre going get into a gray area. That people don't think should exist. You know, God forbid, but it's like You know That. That God forbid we all meet in the middle. No. Don't say It. There's No middle don saying, get off the fence You way my way. Pick a side buddy. You fence rider. like, like pick a side. It's like, yo, I'm creating a side. It is the way ve like to Look. at It. I'm creating a side. And. I, just What. It's even like right Now. Somebody asked me, I was in the gym this morning at the, the Lifetime Fitness somewhere down here in downtown And. I was just making sure, anchored I knew I had a big pod, which all, first of all, I love the pod.


Huge fan. genuinely watch clips all the time. Thank, you watching your evolution And your growth, going from like You know, just like a, like shithead YouTube kid into a man, into a father has been the way you've just gracefully dealt with thing. And Thank. you And. When you're Being a shithead You know That. It's all in the spirit of you. Know. It's, it's a work for you. It's s not a shoot, man. come on, you Know What don saying, let's s go. Let's s go. But it's Yeah for me. a sorry. What was I saying before That I wanna make sure How much you love our Podcast? Yeah I. Do love your podcast. That's where I Got lost at I was like, like, wanna make sure I'm kidding? Flour. My but my sobriety journey is That. My thing is That I think that same way about everything. It's like I, just He was in the He, was in the gym.


And, he's kind of preaching at me And. He's ve like, I've heard You lost a lot of weight this year. I'm like, Yeah, like I'm telling you, I cut out seed oil, sugars, get rid of carbs. ve like you Know. He starts like And. He's like, this is What. You like telling me What, I need to do And. Finally, at some point, I look up at him. And go, man, that sounds like that's really been working. God for You, man, I'm happy for you, for You, for you. 'cause that's what's working for you. I'm eating a potato for breakfast every day. And. I'm losing the fuck outta way. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. you know, What, I mean don don't really need I. Didn't say that, but I'm thinking I don't need you. And, Justin, like, I don't even need that in my, you know, What, I mean like, what's working for me, right? Now is this. And, this is cool. And. When It quits working for me, I'll reassess I Lo I love And. Just So You Know.


the thing that I'll take out of this And It, will It will continue to build on how much I've already been working on It I. Love your confidence in saying that Yeah for Sure. Because, because I've been on this scene Now for six years or seven or whatever, And have had people say, not So. Nice thing about the way I run my program. And, they're people. That, I, respect, And people that Are, Are, Well known, And, And, Are. You talking to me? not at all. No, You've never all You say is that I don't look God, And, stuff like that. That a joke. you Know don. Just kidding. I. come on, don. Just kidding. I my board. No. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. But, but, but certain, certainly I've, I've felt sometimes not as God, as I could about the progress I've made.


Because other people have said that it's s not as much as It could be or should be. And. I should cut out, quote unquote, cut out the seed oil. Is it. not crazy how much people have an opinion on What you should do, but they don't do anything. Hey, We can relate to this Yeah what's happening, right? Now with me. Being a parent. Yeah, everyone has something to say. They're telling you how you should Father And. Most of themed Are bad parents, right? right. They're Telling Why, why is everyone wrong? why is why Are? 5% of people on the right path. And, by the way, maybe I'm wrong, but the point is, at least in parenting, working out whatever, that's like, none of this shit is a perfect science. Everyone's different. like your intuition, your gut, your feeling, at least with parenting for me is like, what's been guiding us And.


It's six days in. It's working. You're re right. It's like six days in We. We're killing It. But that's, do You have a night nurse? Did You get a night nurse? Or, or Are, you just accepting the trauma that's come with That. I. I tried. I fired her within an hour. No. That was horrible. Really, the first time the baby cried. You just shot right in there, huh? No, No. It's, it's I. Yeah. I mean Yeah, Yeah. I. Realize like I, I, I. Don't want this anyone handling my child And like Oh. Because like, bro, let's be honest, I'm in a privileged position where We can afford a night nurse. And, And, And. That is a luxury. But at the same token, I, I care too much to ve like hands off, even at night. Mm. Especially with my first child.


like I. don I, don I. ve like Being An the trenches at the moment, even though I'm tired. Mm. And, And, And. I'm learning So much about parenthood. like, bro, I'm on diaper duty. That's my job. How's The wife doing? She's a fucking hero. She's literally my hero. Oh great. She's a champion, dude. Oh, my God. I was just saying on the last episode, like, women go through, Have y'all Got a workflow at night? Yet? It's, or y'all just swapping on And Off So. We're kind of double teaming. It, right? Now, which isn't great for our sleep. Yeah. We will, We will do the vice versa. But You know. It's just still So special. Y'all Are both rushing It. That's awesome. Yeah, you'll get past That. 'cause this is going last a little longer than you think. It is Yeah t Know. It's A little bit of a journey. Can't wait.


Can't wait. He called me on day three. And. He's like, I. think we've Got. It figured out Yeah Dude. That that night, that night, yo Esme was up from legit, like one to 5:00 AM And on our like three. I was like, Ooh, Is it going affect who I am. I. I need to sleep. Hal, Hal, right? I was hungry. I was angry. I wasn't lonely. What is So. don don't know if, if I'll ever check Behind hat, hat. So tired, but, but Yeah, man. It's, it's, everyone likes to think they're an armchair expert. Yeah, Well on that, on, on, on that topic quickly, the only reason I bring That up is because the old school believes that there is a perfect science to recovery.


Yeah, which is one And. And by the the way. How About that? My thing is, Are, you proud of the progress that you've made, bro? come on. And. Fine. Confi. That's What made you Yeah. You're re Right. talking to Camera was like, like dog. I was fucking the shittiest human on earth, right? If I am just smoking weed, right? Now, And, That offends You, then fuck you. Anyways. Yeah, Well, I. You know, What. I'm saying like, like, like Respectfully onsite taught. Taught me that. Fuck You, man. I changed my whole life. Dude. If you knew I would've choked you. Unconscious fucking And stole your wallet. Fucking at one point in my life, And stomped you on the way out the door. And. Now. I'm just smoking pipe. You like, Hey everybody, like, remind You, I'm killing It. Yeah You. know What. I'm saying it's God. He has, He has the same story.


He was, you say you're the shitty You. Were the shittiest person on the planet. I bet. I bet Mike circa at 2010 would've given you a run No earlier than That 2010. I was. You were on your way back. I was come back around. Well. I mean We. We both. But I wanna tell You something? That That might help You with this. And I. I wasn't never going share this on a podcast again. 'cause I didn't want to have to circle back into this. But I love you enough to share this. don hope it'll help you. I was with Flagrant the first time I did sch And themed podcast. Now Schultz, And me, Are. Really, really, really. God God God friends. And. We were talking to my relationship with the Church 'cause I have a cross on my face. I'm a man of faith. I'm very public about It smoke weed. I also do a lot of thing that don't look Godly, right? And I just told 'em how I felt about the Church on that podcast.


I won't reshare those feelings here. They're online. You can go look 'em up. And I just said. But I love God And. This is how I feel about the Church And man. Did every Pastor It felt like in America the next Sunday rake me across the coals. But I had three of the biggest pastors in The world reach out to me. And go. That was the bravest act of Christianity we've ever seen. Was You going to do That? And? you know, What I realized in that moment, man, man, What, God's Got for me. He sending themed baby I. don know What. If themed mother dudes didn't come, they wasn't for me. And, that's fine. God put me where I'm celebrated. And not tolerated. That is my request. Put me where I belong. You, Know, What. I'm saying, man, if I don't give you No more freedom.


'cause It hurt my feelings. Mike That. First Sunday. I was like, man, I thought I would, I thought Jesus would be proud of the way I carried that conversation. And, these dudes Are, just like this. Jelly roll is the devil. They were like Southern Baptist. like, if you listen to Jelly Roll, you're going, hell, You, Know, And. I'm just like, golly. You know? I was like Jesus Christ. He is going. Listen to I, believe We can fly on the way outta here. You know What. I'm saying I'm the bad guy. You Know Yeah, but So just know That man. Don't worry, man. That shit is like It ended up working out in my favor. 'cause I ended up actually kidding. Closer to God. After That, Yeah, I picked up my Bible for the first time in a decade after that conversation, I started allowing a pastor to pour to me for the first time after a decade.


like It was a It was a breakthrough for me. So on the other side of all that pain, And, all that Pissiness I felt And. The fact that they're still on average, like 20 or 50 churches a Sunday that talk about me in a bad way. That's just part of It dude. God sounds like a water boy. The movie Water Boy, Yeah Foosballs, the devil bomb Yeah. That's, they God your picture on that. They have your picture on the wall. And. The Church Are. like this is Satan right here. The other guys were like most, most mega Church I mean most big pastors, And. A lot of authors hit me up. And was like, man, that that That was accurate. You didn't, you didn't tell a lie. The Church just don't know how to deal with the truth. I, I'm a, I'm a little confused how like, like sometimes with certain sex of religion, sex, S-E-C-T-S, Yeah, right?


can, can't agree on, on their own, like teachings. like something that confused me. We had Cliff And Stewart Connect Lee on on the podcast. And I asked 'em about evolution, right? And, they were like, Yeah, Yes, scientific evolution. Yeah, And, when they said that I was, I was actually surprised. 'cause most Christians, you know, seemed to not believe in evolution. And, And, these guys who Are, like really knowledgeable, And, like devout, you know, God dudes who practiced their craft. And Are, Are the best at It said the opposite of of What. I, I thought like traditional belief was You know these Are, these Are two guys, That Are revered right by by Christians. And, And, Catholics, I don't want to I, don't want mess up, which is which And, the denominations that look up to themed.


But they posted the clip on their INSTAGRAM as Well as saying It on the podcast. And, you know, you're I. When I saw It, I was surprised because they were, they were, they were speaking directly to an audience that a lot of themed don't agree with their opinion. And And, sure enough, in the comments, people reaming themed for saying that evolution is a, is a thing. And, Yeah, And, And. Similar to this like black And white conversation where like nuance is important. And. That that gray area Is, it You. You gotta be comfortable like navigating there. And And, acknowledging That. It exists, but with religion in particular, there's just like a lot of that.


like, it's like, like, almost like I mean, maybe a shitty comparison as Well. like parenting. like there's like an imperfect science And. think think there's like an intuition that That don don't know. like f follow the teachings. That make you feel the best, the most fulfilled. And, That. Make You feel like you Are having that conversation with God, Yeah, So for Sure. Whatever works for you, Yeah Man. Like to, to whatever gets you in touch with a higher plane. Whatever gets you outside. 'cause there's a lot of It to me is just kidding outside of yourself, just ex admitting that there is something greater than you. If not, we're stuck in a real narcissistic loop. By default. Nihilist. You know, What. I mean It gets real, gets real murky. Waters there. And. It's like, but my deal is, first of all, nobody hated religion more than Jesus.


Really? Period. No. Absolutely not. No not a figure ever. why in history has hated religion more than Jesus did. why? He thought It was just a complete kind of a sham. He thought they had turned his, turned And turned a, turned the temple into a merchant. They thought It was more of a, more of a money gag than It was. This is, I'm not telling you nothing in the Bible. Don't say about Jesus for the record. go do your own research. Come up with your own ideals. And. You know, that's What I did I I I I read the same book? Everybody else read I. Maybe they read It different. don don't know. But you know What. I'm saying, but that's possible. That's That's possible. That's real too. And, And, You, Know What. That's fine too. Yep. You know, What I mean? Because I tell people all the time, cool. Runnings is one of my favorite movies. And. They're like, wow. I was like, 'cause I think it's one of the greatest stories ever told.


Because sometimes You can do everything right. And, the Bob Sled still breaks. Nobody else seen that though, right? Everybody else thought It was a movie about a bunch of guys. That shouldn't have been on a mountain in the first place. And. To me, the real magic happened after they were off the mountain. Yeah. It wasn't kidding to the mountain. That was the magic. They thought It was a story of triumph. And, overcoming I said the story was the bobsled broke. They fucking were killing It. Yeah. You know, What.

I Have to ask you about WWE e Please. They say you love It. Love Yeah.


Dude don. I'm like truly a fan. And. I. think the storytelling right? Now is like probably the best it's been in a long time. I was going ask you probably since like, like about the product. like I think it's the best it's been since the Cena era. Yeah And to see Sena come back around. Yep. You know What. I mean like And. I. think before that. It was, you know, I mean It was the attitude era almost. Yeah. So. It's like I. think that we're seeing. I would say wrestling's bigger than it's ever been. right? Now totally So. It's really fun. And, they Are finding a way at the WWE e to serve two masters. And. They're serving that. They're keeping people engaged every single week. And, they're keeping It fast. 'cause the times need fast stories, but they're also allowing bigger stories to develop over longer periods of time.


Yeah God like watching the bloodline develop Oh. God over 36 months. God God Oh my God for Take Taking three Wrestlemanias for Cody to finish his story Yeah like, but they kept us So engaged. That We almost had forgot That. We had been watching these big storylines play out for Sure because they were giving us the little fast nuggets That we needed for INSTAGRAM. And. TikTok too. Yeah, So, I. think they're doing the best they've ever Don, man. I think the talent's higher than it's ever been. I'm just, I'm, I'm admittedly because I'm an older guy as a dude. That like didn't tune into It around this scene of time. It. God really live again. You're like Oh. It's happening. Yeah, And. A couple years ago, I started feeling the writing was changing. I was seeing It more And. I knew that Roman was Roman. You. Know What. I mean You. You did incredible. like you could feel It Yeah.


I mean He. Just It. It felt early. That He was going be a version of the Rock Yeah. That that He was going be some generation's version of the Rock. Yep. you know, What I mean like there's kids out there. That Look at him. like I looked at the Rock. Yep. for Sure. like when 1998, when he's at 96, when he's at Municipal Auditorium, And him And Stone. Kohler doing WW Monday Night Raw. Yeah And. I'm up in the nosebleed section with my brother. I knew that kids were feeling That way about Roman You. You did that. That was, that's A true story. True. Have you told during That That's a true story. Oh. Yeah absolutely told DJ this I mean true. True story. So. It's like going from That. 'cause you know I was a South Nashville kid. We'd go to the wrestling fairgrounds, we'd go to the underground Whoa, we'd go to the backyard.


ECW. Shit's like We were like super white trash. Okay. So can can I. Okay. So. That's amazing. That's amazing. What. What about people who like maybe Are aren't, aren't fans of wrestling because they think you know, What. They think Yeah. like how? How do you describe It to people who, who, who don't understand like What they're watching because I, I admittedly like I was one of those people at some point. Yeah, You're watching one real incredible storytelling like And. It's also wholesome. like You know. There's times It gets a little wild, but that's What makes It even more wholesome when It comes back around because it's always going come back around. And. I'm also into It 'cause I'm an entertainer.


Yeah don a showman, right? Yeah. like I. Just, I'll give you an exam when Are, y'all dropping this Got God A little. You God a little bit. Two weeks. Two weeks. So. I do So. That's all I'm going say.

Even though most of your people Are like, who the fuck is this Fat Dude? Anyway, No. It, not No. They're going not come now. Now Now. Please come. They're Here to watch cousins. You, they're asking who we Are. But I took something from a Roman thing. I'll tell You off camera that I put in my show. Cool. I'm That much of a fan of stuff. That like when I watch thing, I'm like, there's a, there's a quote in the entertainment business. You're going love this 'cause I've watched your pod for years. It says the God ones will borrow, but the great ones will steal.


Steal like an artist. Yeah. Yeah. You know What I mean Yeah So. It's like I stole something. Yep. Straight from Roman. like this Is it So Yeah I started tuning back in And.

And. Then He brings this dude over with the camera, right? And. He's like And. They're looking at It. And. They're looking And. I don't really get It. And. Then It still. I didn't fully get What. They were doing So. I just kind of keep going on about my business. I was like, this dude's obsessed with whatever's happening at this seat. And. Then in the middle of the match, I'm on the other side of where He was. And. When He goes, And climbs up on those ropes. s go. This fucking dude. This is why he's one of the best dudes. This is why He is one of the best content creators. He was looking at the shot. He knew He. He was that particular about exactly where He wanted It to be. And I was like And. I love. Whenever people Are great And, you get to find out why there's something special that happens when somebody's cool.

Yeah about that shot. Yeah. Now. He was He. He was probably going say this, maybe not. He was not only thinking of the future, He was also thinking of the past In that moment, because it's even deeper than than What, you're talking to, He wasn't only trying to create the next shot Yeah, but He was trying to create a continuation. Mm of a shot that It happened. When, how long before that? I'm not even sure. What. You're talking to Mike. Are. You. talking to the, the moons saw off the rope.
