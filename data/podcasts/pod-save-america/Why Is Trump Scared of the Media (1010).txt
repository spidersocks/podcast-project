Welcome, To Pod Save America. I'm John Favreau. And I'm Janaki. On today's show, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump open up a new front in the campaign, the All Out Media blitz. We're gonna get into all the highs and lows of the candidates interviews, what their strategy is, and whether it's working. And later I'm gonna be talking with Joyce Craig, the Democratic candidate for governor in New Hampshire, a state near and dear to both of us about a race we really, really need to win. But first. Jen, it's so awesome to have you. It's great to see you and be here with you. Now, I have not talked to you in person or over Zoom since you were on with Jesse Waters. So congrats on that performance. That was fun. And the bond that was clearly made there.


It was almost awkward to listen to, but I loved It. In fact, I talked to you the night before because I was on your show at the convention, and then the next night I did Jesse Waters. See, look at that. Look at that. Quite a bookend. So Everyone knows who you are. Former White House Press secretary, host of MSNBC's inside with Jen Psaki. But most importantly, a good friend who spent many anxious Octobers with me for the last 20 years. Now, So many, so many polar coasters together. Some ended up better than others. That's true. Our first not so good later on. That's true. Much better. The, The carry campaign days when we thought we were winning the day of the election because of the polls that day.


Like the polls 'cause the exit polls. That was incorrect. A lesson learned by all. Quick vibe. Check. How are you feeling? Optimistic and nervous. Okay. Both all of the feelings. Yeah. You know, I get asked this question a lot. I was just down getting coffee and somebody asked me, what's, what do you think's gonna happen? And I, and how do you think the race is? And I said, and he said, don't tell me it's close. Well, I mean, that's kind of where we are this many days out. I can go, do you want me to go state by state with you? I can, but yes. Lemme make Sure you get lots of those too. I was just at a dinner last night, which was basically everyone at the dinner, just like I, I had to, I ended up doing a, a live Pod Save America for people because they were like, yeah, tell us what's gonna happen and, and why it's, why it's gonna be okay.


And I was like, I can't do either of those things. Unfortunately, You, it's, it's the time of year. We've all lived through, I was at my neighborhood block party a couple of weeks ago, and more than one person stopped me and said, how big is this Georgia hand counting situation? I was like, so the level of specificity. But that's, that is what everybody's paying attention to for good reason. And we've all been through not only losing, like you and I were a part of in 2004. We've been through winning and the elation of that, and we've been through the trauma that was 2016 and 2020 in different ways. So no wonder everybody feels traumatized, So I know. It does. That's a good point. It makes sense. Okay, let's get into it. The other week, Dan suggested an everything everywhere, all at once, media strategy for Kamala Harris.


And boy has she delivered. Yes. In the last 72 hours, the Vice President has done Caller Daddy 60 Minutes. The View Howard Stern, Stephen Colbert and Coach Walls was on Jimmy Kimmel, Live Harris also has a Univision Town Hall Thursday. Those appearances will reach combined tens of millions of viewers, many of them voters who aren't political junkies like you and I, some who haven't decided whether to vote or who to vote for. Let's take a listen to some of the highlights from Harris and Wall's appearance. Please welcome back the next president of the United States. There are so many people in our country who are right in the middle.


They're taking care of their kids and they're taking care of their aging parents. And it's just almost impossible to do it all. So what I am proposing is that basically what we will do is allow Medicare to cover in home healthcare. They try to paint you like you're some leftist who, who I don't know, who wants to have people running through the streets committing crimes. You were a prosecutor. I have put a lot of people in jail. I have personally prosecuted everything from child sexual assault to homicides. You All remember it when we grew up, this idea that we could have different ideas, but we have unity, love the democracy, have an election, and then shake hands and admit the person who won won One of the old saws is I, they just want somebody they can have a beer with.


So would would you like to have a beer with me? so I can tell people what that's like. Okay, this was now we asked ahead of time. 'cause I can't just be given a drink to the vice President of the United States without asking. You asked for Miller highlight you Miller highlight. So cheers. There you go. Okay, cheers. There you go. You know when you've lost, you lost millions of jobs. You lost manufacturing, you lost automotive plants, you lost the election. What does that make you a loser? This is what happens when I drink Beer Miller High Life. That is a, it's A choice.


That is a commitment to winning Wisconsin, right? There it is. It is a commitment to winning Wisconsin. She's like, I will just roll in floating jello and punch and have Miller High Life every day until the election. Whatever it takes. Whatever needs to happen. I know you've been talking about this on your show too, but what do you think of Harris's media strategy and this, this last week? I love it. You know, and I remember, and I know I heard, I heard Dan's description and I, and that hearkened me back to working for Dan many, many years ago. Yeah. I mean, the thing to for everybody to remember is that most people are not putting politics in their veins every day. Like you and I and everybody listening to your show every week, and everybody who watches me every week in that same way.


And the majority of people who Kamala Harris needs to vote are not doing that. And so what she's doing is so smart because she is getting outside of the bubble of people who are talking to themselves about the election and matters and what doesn't and what has an impact and what doesn't. The other piece, and I talked about this a little bit on my show the other night, but just to get this some things off my chest, is it drives me absolutely insane. And I say this, having spent 10 years working in the White House, briefing the press every day, I value the press. I understand and value the role of the media, but the notion that you can only ask a question of a presidential candidate or a president if you have a White House press credential is absurd, absurd, absurd.


And all you have to do is listen to, and I listened to the Howard Stern interview this morning. He is an excellent interviewer, better than anyone else. I have heard interview a presidential candidate in my many years of doing this. Yeah. And he got to all of the core questions. I mean, they talked about Putin, they talked about her plans for the economy. They talked about her career as a prosecutor. And the thing that is so appealing about how we ask the questions is there's an element of performative stuff that happens. I think, I don't think you and I do it as much, but I, I think it happens of course in the media where it's like people think they have to do something like this. Hello, vice President Harris, how concern are you concerned that Vladimir Putin was receiving covid tests from Donald Trump?


It's like, are you fucking kidding me? Of course I'm concerned who isn't concerned, right? I mean, so he asked the question like, isn't that insane? And it's like, yes, it's insane. And what does it mean? And I think that is how people digest things and it, but I love the strategy because it is way outside of the bubble. I mean, call her mother, call her daddy, call her daddy. I'm like, call your mother, whatever. you know what I'm talking about. Also, call Your mother Place. I'm, I've been mixing up the things. Call her daddy has 10 million listeners. I know. It's wild. And most of them are under 35. It's really, really smart. I will say as a sidebar, I was like, oh, I'm an Alex Cooper fan. I love her.


I'm gonna listen to her now. Right. so I'm in the car with my nine yearold daughter yesterday, and I'm like, I'll just find a past episode. Nuh nope. Yep. No, I put it on and I was like, whoa. Yeah, no, I Mean, I'll listen to it. Not with my 9-year-old in the car, but yes, I think it's outside of the people who Google refresh on White house.gov outside of the people who are listening to your excellent podcast every week. It needs to be way outside of that. And I think the last thing I'll say is this, this polling that everybody overly focuses on and then describes in their own way, which is another thing that drives me insane. Yeah. Like the 28% who wanna know more about her. we don't know exactly what that means.


My gut here is that 28% is not looking for a 200 page economic plan dropped on each of their doorsteps, though she does have a plan. That's what, 85 pages or something. They want to know what makes her tick and how she thinks about things. What is driving her to think about home healthcare? What is driving her to think about the child tax credit she talked about? That's what these interviews help achieve. Well, it it's exactly right. And at the end of the day, a lot of voters who haven't figured out what they're gonna do yet, again, these are people who are not, not even like listening, To Pod, Save America or or your show. They're barely paying attention to the news at all.


Yeah. Because they're, they're just living their lives doing other stuff and they're gonna vote some of them, and they're tuning in at the last minute. And so you kind of just, it's a volume game. You have to be everywhere. Yes. Because you want, like by chance, if they just happen to be watching The View, or they happen to be in their car listening to Serious Satellite Radio and there's Howard Stern, right. Like, you just have to catch people at times where they're tuning in, which is infrequently for a lot of these voters. And they're gonna end up making their mind with like, via an impression of the candidate. Right. To Totally. I mean, I I will say one thing I may disagree with Dan on, I don't, maybe he wouldn't disagree with me, but is I do think that interviews like Call her Daddy and Howard Stern are more important in this moment when voter registration deadlines are coming up.


Mm. People are actually voting and it's like, what's gonna give you a kick in the butt to get out the door? Then 60 Minutes is always good to do. Right? Yeah. It's very powerful reach then a lengthy interview with the New York Times. Like I read The New York Times every day, but it's just, that's not it. No one ever needs to do it. It's honestly you. I I, and you know how I love the New York Times, I'm not a New York Times hater, but same, but the, I I, I read it at first, But the idea of a sit down with the New York Times talk about like, communicating with the same fucking people who have already made up their minds such, just, It makes no Sense. It just makes no sense. And that's no disrespect to the New York Times. It's just if you're a campaign strategist, that's not where you want to go.


And I also think, you know, so there was first, there was the news cycle. She's avoiding the press, she's avoiding tech, but it's always a, you know, this, it's always a trap because Yeah. Then she does 60 Minutes and of course, because it's 60 fucking minutes, they asked her really tough questions. Yeah. And, you know, and, and I think they asked her one on immigration and, and they were like, well, wasn't it too late what you did? And wasn't it too late when you do the, and they asked her like three separate times. And of course now that they Trump campaigned, everyone like jumps all over it once you do the tough interview and now they're like, you know, complaining, we want the full unedited transcript out there, which is just completely ridiculous. 'cause like, the reason, it's, the reason we all know that she had a couple different answers is because 60 Minutes put out the whole interview.


But it's, you can't win is the problem. It's a real, I I also love this talking, or I love hate it. I mean that you hear coming from Trump Trump's people that's like, or people who are like trying to be, you know, I'm not on any side, I'm just giving analysis. Right. People just need to know more about her plans and her policies. And it's like, are you kidding me right now she's not running against Mitt Romney. Right. What are you talking about? Like, he can't, do you know what any of his plans are people who even love him, did they, could they articulate a five point plan of his No. No, of course not. That's not why they're for him. No. He's gonna close the border. That's it. One thing I wanted to ask you, like, it's obviously hard to drive a single message with so many interviews and questions over, over what, 72 hours.


Yeah. But could you detect any themes or do you think the intended message was the media strategy itself? Some of it was, I think they had to get over the hurdle of the media strategy. Like, I'm not afraid, get outta here. I'm doing a hundred interviews in four days. Right. Yeah. Some of the themes, and I was listening for exactly this, and as you well know, you can't control what the people ask you about. Right. Right. And Alex Cooper wanted to ask about women's rights, abortion rights and specifics there. So there were obvious themes that were coming through in that. One of the things I did hear over and over again, which was in her convention speech, you hear her do this in the stump, is like, he, he's, he is like not a serious person, right.


About Trump. That's one of her lines. He's thinking about himself, not about you. Right. Yeah. There were some lines and messages that you did hear over and over again, but, you know, they covered the gamut a little bit. But I think what she is kind of good at, and, and I thought that this was the case, especially in the Howard Stern interview, was kind of bringing it back to like, you know, he asked her about working at McDonald's and kind of things along those lines. And she would bring it back to, well, that's why I care so much about an opportunity agenda. Right. And people may be like, what's an opportunity agenda? But she, she's getting better at bringing it back to what the core message is. So a little bit of it's about, I'm about you, I'm gonna fight for you.


And he's fighting for himself, which I have always thought is a core message. Right. And that was a core message in 2012 when you and I were working for Obama and he ran. Yeah. What do you think, what did you, what did you, did you hear thematics or did you hear more like arou all over The place? No, I heard that. I heard she, it's interesting, I think she did this with Stern, but she talked about she sees this election as strength versus weakness. Yeah. And trying to redefine what strength is and, and basically trying to define Trump as weak, just because he doesn't care about people. Which is interesting. Like, I, you could tell in some of these interviews, Howard Stern, a few others, that she's like, they know that they're having issues with young men.


And so she wanted to appear tough, which I think yes, she is. Right. Like, and she talked about talking about Havelock locking people up. Havelock, Have you shot it? She's, of course I have. How's like, Oh, she's firing Glocks. She's locking people up. Like, you know, she's, she's, she's not gonna be defined as weak, that's for sure. so I, I could detect that a little bit. And I don't know, it's interesting with her like having watched all this, I think she is, she's excellent talking about personal stuff Yeah. And her life and like, just being a normal human being And abortion. Abortion, I mean, I mean, she talks about it in a way that is like better than most people who talk about it, including people who lead organizations around it.


Yeah. And, and like has a real passion, you know? Yes. And I think that she's also really good when she goes after Trump. Yes. Like she's, I think that she's at her sharpest there. You you made the point about everyone, me, like, I need your plans. I need your plans. When she feels like forced to talk about her plans, like the details of the plans are good. When she tries to put like, language and values around it, that's when she, I think gets into the, you know, she's sort of just talking about, it's like a little more cliche. Yeah. But I think like if I, if I, you know, small things at this point, but like making it more of a contrast with Trump, even on the policies. Yes. So it's like, like, what do you wanna do? And I think in 60 Minutes she did the, they asked how you pay for it. And she's like, well, I want to make the middle class strong.


And he wants to make it weak, which is directionally the right message. Yeah. But it's more like big tax cut. He wants to give big tax cut to rich people. I wanna give tax cut to the middle class, done no other language. Like, that's it, that's all you need to do. It's also Yes, that's so true. I, because there Yeah. There's something about it that's like, it's not quite there. It still feels like you're reading from the talking points off of your speech. Yeah. I think she'll get there. But it is the contrast piece. It is like, the childcare one is such a good one too, because remember when he was asked about childcare and it was like, oh yeah, clearly since you and I are, the Tariffs are gonna play for paper Childcare in the thick of child rearing right now, I can tell you that man has never had a conversation about childcare in his life. Never. But she can make that point, right?


Yep. Yep. Look, that guy's never had a conversation about childcare. He is never dealt with that. Ever. Yeah, that's a good idea. Yeah. And some of that is making him seem, which he is disconnected from what people are actually going through. Which I think is, if she can, if she can drive that home and sort of like she's done a great job sort of chipping away at his advantage on the economy and she's, you know, leading when the question is, cares about people like you and fighting for people like you, if she can make that the big issue in the home stretch and really paint him as out of touch and her is connected to people, I think that like, that's her, her her best chance of putting this away. Yes. For sure. On that note, there were a few bits of news to come outta the interviews on the view, and we heard this in the clip, the vice president announced that she wants Medicare to cover home healthcare vision and hearing.


So right now, if you're caring for an aging parent or a relative, basically they have to qualify for Medicaid to get care that allows them to stay at home and to get someone to come to the, to their home and care for them. And I, I've, we had that experience with my grandmother. Like, you basically have to spend your life savings in order to qualify for Medicaid. And the waiting list is very, very long. And so it's really, really hard for a lot of seniors to be able to like, stay in their home and then they have to go somewhere else, or you have to, if you are the, the, the the son or daughter or the grandkids, then you have to care for them. While, and Kamala Harris pointed this out while you're also caring for your own children.


Yeah. Talked about the sandwich generation. Yeah. What did, what did you think about the, the policy? Do you think that was smart? I think that's great. I also love that she is thinking about very specific nuggets. I mean, you and I lived through the Affordable Care Act on popularity for many years, right? Yes. Yep. And it felt so overwhelming to people and it became this thing that was tied to Barack Obama. So if you liked him, you liked it. If you didn't like him, you didn't like it even when it was the program you were on in your state. And there was tons of research that showed that people would say, do you like the healthcare you're on? Yeah. I love it. Do you? And it was, it was Obamacare.


Do you like Obamacare? I do not. Right. Right. And I think the problem with big, huge plans and talking about it as the big huge plan is that people politicize it in their minds and they don't understand the nugget and the nuggets. The Affordable Care Act became more popular in part because people didn't like having something taken away from them. Yeah. Right. But also in part because the President Obama, when we were working for him and, and the team started breaking down the pieces of it. Yes. Right. It's like, Hey, your, your kids can be covered if they're under 25. It's like, oh, they can, they don't even care what else is in the Affordable Care Act. That's great if you have a preexisting condition.


And so elements of this remind me of that. And, and to your earlier point, she's better in talking about the economic pieces when she's talking about the $6,000 tax credit if you have a new baby. Right. This particular piece you just explained on home healthcare, which so many people deal with and navigate because it becomes real to people and it doesn't make them feel like they are being spat out a Right. A pamphlet. Yeah. Right. Yeah. It's like a thing that could help me and I'm for that thing. Yep. And she had some, you know, she had personal experience too that she talked about. Yeah. 'cause she took, had took care of her mother when her mother had cancer. Yep. So she also made news on the view in a way she probably didn't intend to, when the hosts asked this question, would You have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?


There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of, and I've been a part of, of, of most of the decisions that have had impact. Listen, I plan on having a Republican in my cabinet. You asked me, oh, I got a list. Yes. Right. You, you asked me what's the difference between Joe Biden and me? Well, that will be one of the differences. So Trump and Vance, unsurprisingly pounced on this. I think they had an ad out this morning. There's like a, at least one Republican house candidate has an ad on this. Obviously reporters jumped on it. She got the question again on Colbert, basically punted again saying she's not Joe Biden, but she's also not Donald Trump. That got a lot of applause. We talked last show about the reports that the Harris folks are contemplating putting more daylight between her and Biden.


And there's certainly a case to be made that a lot of voters wanna see how she'd be different. But obviously that's a tricky balance for a number of reasons. Yeah. How do you think she should answer this question? Didn't we love it when people kind of backseat drove when we were sitting in the White House or any campaigns we were like burning them in effigy in the office, but let's do it anyway because I, I literally, I, I listened to that part and I was texting with the executive producer of my show about exactly this answer. Right? Yeah. Because it's an obvious question you would get, which is, again, easy for us to say. I think to me, it can be something like this. I love Joe Biden and I'm so proud of what we've built together, but nobody expects us to be carbon copies of each other.


Yeah. Because challenges change the world change. I'm proud, I'm gonna be proud to build on what we accomplished, but I am different. I'm coming at it from a different perspective and I, that is gonna be part of my guide. Well, what specifically will be different? Well, I'll tell you this. You know, I'm somebody who went to visit an abortion clinic that's important to me. I have dealt with dealing with home healthcare because of my mother, you know, in terms of what, how the policies, you know, my point is like her, who she is and her background is different. Yep. It's like having different people and a different table to make decisions. But I think there's a way to say a different kind of pivot, which is like, I love him, I'm gonna build on that, but we're not carbon copies.


Don't expect it. And I come at things from a different perspective. What is that gonna look like? Well, there's time to figure that out. I mean, I'm not sure she has to give a list of 10 things or that's my take. Yeah. It's just sending an indication. And the reason this is so important and why the Trump people pounced on it is because she is more of the change candidate Right now when you look at polling than Trump, which is a very, 'cause the change candidate is often and typically the winning candidate. Yep. And the fact that she's the sitting vice president and is seen as more of the change candidate is a huge plus for her. And the Trump team wants to change that. But So anyway, I don't think it needs to be a list of 10 things she's already done, like one slightly thing, different thing on taxes.


But she can just emphasize how she will build. But she's coming at it from a different perspective and she's gonna approach problems slightly differently. And he knows that she loves Joe. He gets that. Yeah. I, I totally agree with that. I think that's a great answer. I get why it's tricky because Joe Biden's unpopularity is not tied to specific decisions and policies that he pushed or made. Right? Like, and that's what's so hard about this. The unpopularity is tied to the broader discontent with the effects of pandemic induced inflation, right? Yeah. Which, which he did not have anything to do with.


And we go, you know, we've been through this for the last several years, so it's really hard to go back and be like, he, and she was also, as she said in one of the appearances, she's like, I was part of most of the decisions. So she can't go back and be like, I actually secretly disagreed with him on X, Y, and Z, but I just didn't say anything. Right. So you're limited in what you can do on that, even just to be honest. Yes. I do think she can say like, she can sort of like break the, the fourth wall here and just be like, Hey, I realize that everyone wants me to just like, put some distance between us or say something different. The truth is like, we all wish we could do different things. If we look back at the, at the last four years, and I was in the administration too, everyone looks back that she's like, I'm not looking back though.


I'm looking forward. And that is the whole reason I'm here in the future. And you know what Joe Biden has been trying to, and I have been trying to lower costs and a lot of times Republicans blocked our attempts to lower costs. Yeah. And so what I'm hoping to do as president is to keep fighting and to keep lowering costs. And Donald Trump doesn't wanna do that. He wants to give tax cuts to rich people. Totally. Like I would, I think you gotta be like, punch it a little bit more. Yes. And back to the Trump contrast, I mean totally. The Trump contrast is so key to it. The other two things I think are, that are tricky for her in my view, is one Joe Biden is still the president. Yeah. Right. And like the whole question of like where she is on Israel and where she is on Gaza, he is the president while there is a team trying to negotiate a ceasefire deal, which doesn't look likely at this moment.


No. But you can't have the sitting vice president of the United States. And I don't know what her position is on this, but if she has a different one, you can't have her come out with a different position one president At a time Than sitting president. Well, there's a team overseas. So that's one challenging thing. The other challenging thing is obviously there is still a great deal of heartache and heartburn from a, a swath of the party that feels deeply upset on behalf of Joe Biden. Right? Yeah. Many of them are attacking you and I on Twitter currently. I'm certain And that's fine. Even though I stop reading, I'm stop paying attention. Yeah. We're just here to state what was happening in, in the political discussion at the moment. But that aside, she has, has managed this perfectly.


She did not push him out in any way, shape, or form. Right. He made the decision, she acted immediately. She does not want to appear like she is pushing him and his policies over the ledge. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Because she's managed that piece very well. And that's another tricky piece I think for her. Yeah. It's, I mean the, the truth of it is how she's gonna be different is we're in a different time than when he took office. Yes. And she was vice president. And where we are now is, you know, the economy has bounced back, but prices are still too high and costs are still too high. So her focus is gonna be on costs. That's what's gonna be different, you know, and it's not for anything that he did poorly, it's just that we're in a different time period now. Yes. And it's, it's like, look back when Barack Obama was elected, he was not openly for gay marriage.


Right. Right. Yeah. I mean, times change, things evolve. She's gonna be dealing with different types of challenges as well. And that's an important thing to remember. But she's also coming at things with an entirely different background, which will impact things For sure. Well, I just, she's got that Univision Town hall Thursday night. I, I'm, I'm betting that they'll practice practice. Another answer. I, I hope so. Fingers Crossed That is one where you're like, that is one that can be fine tuned from the first time she answered the question. I think when she was asked by Dana Bash about changing positions, she did have a different answer in 60 minutes.


That was better, I think. Yeah. I thought that was my, I thought that Too than in her CNN interview and you figure out how to answer things in a better way. Yep. It doesn't mean your an your position change, it just means how you articulate it. That's a natural part of doing more interviews.

On our Howard Stern interview, he asked about a report that emerged yesterday from Bob Woodward's forthcoming book as if we needed a Woodward book. We don't have enough content out there. It's like I know, I know. I saw that yesterday. I was like, where did all the Podcasts, how do I find them all? Fuck, We have to talk about this now. And so Trump's personal re it's about Trump's personal relationship with Vladimir Putin, including sending him covid tests for his own use at the beginning of the pandemic when it was extremely hard to get covid tests. The Trump campaign denied this. Kremlin confirmed it today. Let's listen to her answer on this. So I actually said it, even in the debate, I believe that Donald Trump has this desire to be a dictator.


He admires strong men and he gets played by them because he thinks that they're his friends. Yeah. And they are manipulating him full time and manipulating him by flattery. Yeah. And with favor. And so in the midst, to your point, as reported by Bob Woodward in the height of the pandemic, and remember in your listeners will remember, people were dying by the hundreds. Yeah. We, everybody was scrambling to get these kits, the tests, the the covid test kits. Couldn't get 'em, couldn't get 'em right. Couldn't get 'em anywhere. Right.


And this guy who was president of the United States is sending them to Russia to a murderous dictator for his personal use when he was talking about Americans should be putting bleach in their blood. That is just the most recent stark example of who Donald Trump is. She seemed genuinely offended and upset by that outage, which I liked. Oh, First of all, can also, that is the question anyone would have asked her from any major outlet. Can we just I know. I mean, and that answer is a great answer. She would've given no matter who asked the question, but actually he asked it in a way that teed her up, maybe in a way to be even more impassioned about it.


Yeah. Yes. I mean, her point is, the manipulation point is such an interesting one. And it made me think like, I mean, SNL has been doing so many good things about this presidential campaign right now. They have the best people playing them. An amazing skit would be Vladimir Putin Netanyahu, the head of the Heritage Foundation. Oh yeah. The people who pick Supreme Court justices just sitting around licking their traps about how they can manipulate Donald Trump. That's good if he is elected that, because that's how they all look at it. Yeah. Right. This is a person who's the vehicle for me getting my thing done. And it's a great response to the people who are like, well, Trump's kind of crazy, but maybe it's good that he's crazy because everyone's gonna be afraid of him.


And you know, like I, I talked to a friend who actually said that to me, who is voting for Harris, but was like, you know, you, you do have to admit, you know, Trump's a little crazy and on the world stage, maybe that helps. And I was like, no, it doesn't help because all these other fuckers are smarter than him, these other dictators. And they're playing him all the time, and it's gonna be more dangerous 'cause they're getting exactly what they want because he is dumb. When you have a dumb unfit person as your president, it doesn't matter if he's crazy, if he's dumb, they're gonna be able to take advantage of him. It is. so I mean the other, we're just gonna, I'm just, we're just gonna keep offering talking points to the Harris team and they're gonna, they're gonna Be like, thanks guys. He's so Thrilled. Really appreciate, thrilled and delighted by that. But the other thing, and I've talked about this a little bit on my show, is like, dictators are not strong.


They are weak. Yeah. They cannot be democratically elected. They need to control the media. They need to control anybody who is their opponent. That is why Donald Trump likes them, because they control things and you only have to control things if you're weak. Yep. And that's a sign of his own weakness. Yeah. Not strength Actually. And she, I think she really nailed that point. All right. Let's talk about Trump. The candidate who's clearly hiding from tough questions and real journalists. His media appearances the last few days have been with Trump supporters and Right, right-Wing networks. Ben Shapiro, who's hosted a fundraiser for Trump. Hugh Hewitt, who ended his interview by telling him to come back after he is president again, Laura Ingram, who SHOs for him every night.


And Newsmax, which just settled a defamation lawsuit for spreading Trump's election, lies one interview. Trump was too scared to do 60 Minutes, which he backed out of last minute. The broadcast, which was a special episode that was supposed to feature both candidates. Started with Scott Pelley reading text and emails from the Trump campaign that confirmed his appearance, followed by an explanation for why he canceled. Let's listen. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump accepted our invitation. But unfortunately, last week, Trump canceled the campaign offered shifting explanations. First it complained that we would fact check the interview.


We fact check every story later. Trump said he needed an apology for his interview in 2020. Trump claims correspondent Leslie Stalls said in that interview that Hunter Biden's controversial laptop came from Russia. She never said that. Both campaigns understood this special would go ahead if either candidate backed out. So First of all, Scott Kelly's voice is so great. So 60 minutes. It's so 60 minutes. It's so awkward. Those, those texts are just uncomfortable. You know, I mean, do you think this, like, does this matter?


I mean, I do think it, it probably doesn't, I don't know if it matters to voters, although I hope it does. But at least the, the media, which has been like Harris, hiding from the press. I mean, like Donald Trump has just ducked 60 minutes, backed out last minute, won't do the next debate, and has just been like, retreating to his safe space of, of right wing interviewers. I mean, first of all, I also hear the talking point, which is another one I hate. Well, Donald, this is the Donald Trump strategy, just doing interviews with people who reach bigger audiences. You're like, he's doing interviews with like white nationalists and like, it's a little bit different. Okay. Yeah.


So let's just start there. I don't know that it matters. I wish that it would be a point that would make media or people who are analysts question this Harris isn't out there enough. She is out there a ton. Yeah. Point. I'm not sure entirely if it will. The other, the other point that I hear over and over again that again, we're just gonna debunk here is JD Vance has answered hundreds of questions or whatever the point is. You're like, have you listened to him answer the questions? Because this is what he does. He says, oh, we're gonna hear out their question. And they may ask, you know, what do you think of Donald Trump lying about hurricane relief funds?


And he'll say, that's a ridiculous question or whatever. He's not answering the questions. He's using them as a tool. Yeah. Oftentimes He's also, he's also the least popular candidate on either tickets. So that's, that's what his press strategy has done. Yes. Yes. That is true too. I, I don't know that it's gonna matter. I don't think it matters. I don't know that the like number of media interviews anyone is doing ever really matters to voters. Just like nobody cares if candidates or presidents do press conferences. They should. It is not a thing voters are moved by. I think it's more the content of what's popping out of these. And I listened when you guys talk about this the other day, and the point that often people miss is it's like, it's not just the interview, it's the content from the interview, right?


Like what's on Instagram, what's on TikTok? What videos are on YouTube that are being pushed out? And that video of Harris answering the question about a hum whether, you know, Sarah Huck could be Sanders question. Oh yeah. That, that's good. Sarah Huck could be Sanders point about her not being humble. My girlfriend's from college were sending that around. They were like, I don't even know what this podcast is. I'm gonna listen to the whole episode. Right. That's great. I mean, that's the kind of thing, right? Obviously you want people to just not listen, just listen to the episode. You want 'em to also register and then vote. But there, there has a, so that's why it matters. But I don't, I don't, I don't actually think people care if Donald Trump does 60 Minutes or not. Well, here's what he sounded like in all of the interviews that he did do.


Oh boy, we got some up, we got some highlights. Here we go. Okay, This is not a precedent. She's answering questions in the most basic way and getting killed over it. And every time she does an interview, it, she sounds like a child. She sounds like a person with a very low iq actually, now that you're mentioning it, I think they should do a double 25th Amendments. Just get 'em both out. Who's third online, the name Fake news. I was very proud of it. But now it just isn't strong enough. It is just so corrupt. And I call it corrupt news now. A murderer, I believe this, it's in their genes. And we got bad, a lot of bad genes in our country right now, they are illegal immigrants as far as I'm concerned.


But you don't tax the rich. How will you restore faith in our justice system? A lot of people will say, well, he's just gonna do to them what he they did to him. Get back at them. Yeah. And they're, A lot of people say that's what should happen. You wanna know the truth. But I have a hard time doing it to them because I'm ba you know, I'm basically a truthful person. But, and, and frankly, No, but frankly, no. But frankly, They all have to, The laughing when he says, I'm basically a Truthful person. I'm basically, it's Donald Trump. He's basically a truthful person, Basically. I mean, I love when then Sean h and you could was that Laura Ingram? Laura Ingram, Yeah.


Yeah. When Laura and she was sort of trying to like hand him a softball there. Yeah. I mean, it was a warped messed up softball. Or when the times when Sean Hannity tries to like help him out. And it's like, he just dive, he just can't even handle the, the easy tee Up. That was one of three times she, she went back twice to like, try to help him and be like, say that he's not gonna take revenge on his political opponents. Some people Are saying that's what should happen. He Refused to do it, he's gonna do it. That was like a se I mean, in there was him saying like, oh, you don't wanna tax the rich. Like there were so many things in there in that small compilation that would like sink a normal campaign.


And I don't know. I mean, I'm, I'm still under the, like, I, I still believe the more Trump we hear, the better it is. I don't know what you think. Yeah, I agree. And I, and this is an impor, this is a debate that's been going on for years, right? Yeah. And I feel like maybe a year ago I hit this point where I was like, you know what, when you listen to him, it is so crazy. Bananas off the wall with problematic positions. Yep. It's much more effective for people to listen to it themselves. Yes. Which is why I think one, she keeps saying, watch his rallies. Watch his rallies. That was her answer in 60 minutes when it was like, what do you think of him not doing?


And she was like, well, I guess people are gonna have to watch his rallies. Right? Yeah. Many people watch his rallies, but also if, if p if you just play and we do this a lot and you guys, it's like you just play what he just said. It's like, I'm not gonna s and wash it for you. I'm not gonna explain it. That's what that was. And beyond his hugely problematic positions on a range of issues and xenophobia and racism, he sounds unhinged and also incoherent. Yes. Right. I think, and I think that's the most important takeaway for Yes. Voters who haven't decided. Because you know, I think in 16 when he was first on the scene, it was like, listen to what he says. Isn't that offensive? Isn't that gonna sink him? And then it wouldn't offend, it wouldn't sink him because people were like, eh, yeah it was offensive, but whatever.


But when you hear him now it's different because he sounds so crazy. He just sounds crazy. Well, crazy. And also like, even if I were trying to follow you, even if you were talking about things that I agreed with, yeah. I'd be like, I'm a little concerned here because it's like, you know, even if you were saying people, the child tax credit should be extended, but then he went into like a sharks versus being electrocuted, you're like, hmm, I don't know. You know? Yeah. It's like I just, and I like the child tax credit thing, but the Sharks incu electrocution thing that's real concerning. Or Hannibal Lector, I mean, whatever it may be. There's a million examples. I know I also in, in terms of like his media strategy, to the extent that there may be a media strategy, it does seem like the difference is she's going on these shows and some of them are friendly, some of them are, you know, tough questions.


Some of them are just really smart, substantive questions. But she seems like she's least gonna end up reaching a bunch of persuadable voters because she's not going on just the, just the lefty stuff. And she's not doing just, you know, shows that high engaged voters pay attention to. But with Trump, it seems like he's doing like a pure turnout base strategy with, with these, which, which may work for him because he's had fantastic turnout in 2016 and again and even higher in 2020 for his base. But it seems like, you know, they, they're looking for low propensity young men. And so he's doing some of those podcasts. But then other than that it's just like turn out the base kind of stuff. Yeah. I mean I think part of it is also he knows that his ceiling is low.


They know that. Yeah. And so, and the potential for expanding that is, is low and they're not running any strategy that seems like they have any intention of trying to expand, at least not from him. Right. So part of it is destroy her, reduce voter turnout, suppress voters. So that I will have more, I think is part of the strategy. The other thing I'm betting, and I don't know, I'm not in the Trump preps for, or the Harris preps, any of the preps, but I've prepped a lot or I've tried to convince a lot of people running for office to do interviews and everybody, you approach it differently. My bet is that, and I remember, do you remember that that quote that was on background.


It's, this also drove me crazy. I'm getting a lot off my chest today. I like that from somebody who once worked with her, for her that was like, you have to go in there prepared and have read all the materials and give her a reason for doing something. It's like, no shit. That is what you do for anybody who is president or running for president. I mean, what, that's the baseline. But what, but I also, it made me think that we used to go in, especially the last couple of years when we, when, you know, post Dan Zach Gki amazingness, we started to do more and more things like that. We would go into the Oval Office with one slide to President Obama and we'd say, here are the things I think we think you should do. And a lot of them would be off the wall things.


Right. And he'd say, why? And we'd say, because this reaches this group of people who care deeply about criminal justice reform and you're gonna care. Yep. And it's like this thing is, you know, and I think my bet is that she requires an A and demands that as well, which forces the system to really think about what they're proposing to her and make sure it has a purpose. Whereas Trump, again, I don't know, my bet is he might be like, who's that guy who said I, I was good at the rally. Let's go on his show. Like it might be like that. I don't know. It's very possible. Yeah. I think some of it is like comfort food for him, right? Yeah. Like let him go and make him feel comfortable with whoever he wants. And some of it, like that podcast that, that last clip where they were all laughing at him was, it's called the Flagrant Pod podcast.


It's just like a Andrew Shel, he's a comedian. And so I, I'm guessing it's like this, someone in the campaign is thinking like young male demographic go on those pods. Yes. But the Shapiro Ingram stuff is just, that is comfort food for him. And it's just like, let's Just Yes. It the combo. Yeah. I mean this is the important thing I think also for people to remember. You know, one, we're optimistic but nervous. Yes. Whatever we say, the combo of things is here 'cause it's all very close. Which I know drives people crazy. But it is true. It's is that as much as Trump is a loony tune who says scary, crazy stuff and it's incoherent, his campaign is actually running ads that are quite disciplined on the same topics of crime and immigration online and on tv, everywhere.


And I'm not saying that is going to win him the election, but it is, there is a level of discipline that is below him that I think is important for people to remember. Yes, for sure. Because, and that's, and that's one reason why it's so close. I think one last clip I wanna get your reaction to, did not tell you about in advance. That's all right. It is from my now good friend Jesse Waters. I interviewing, oh, one of my successors in the White House, Steven Miller. We're getting a lot of texts from women about Miller and his appearances and his appearance. Our audience at Primetime believes you're some sort of sexual matador.


What do you have to say for yourself? Well, let me give advice to any young man that's out there. The, I'm married now, I have children, but I wasn't married that long ago. I was single. I was in the market. If you're a young man, it's very important in election season. Who's looking to impress ladies to be the alpha to be attractive? The best thing you can do is to wear your Trump support on your sleeve. Show that you are a real man. Show that you are not a betta. Okay? Right. Be a proud and loud Trump supporter, and your dating life will be fantastic. I cannot wait to see the text tonight. Jen, my, there's so Many things to Say. My question is, do you find it hard to resist Steven Miller's sexual energy?


First of all, I'm like breathing into a paper bag over here, because that was, first of all, he didn't even say beta, right? Beta, beta, beta. You know, I, I wouldn't say that somebody who seems to wake up in the morning trying to kick immigrants out of the United States is like the person who I would be most drawn to. I don't know who these texts are coming from. Are they Steven Miller's mom? Are they like, I mean, I have bots. I do not know to each his own. But I will say too, like for a guy who's into race science and gene and all that shit, you know, he's not, he's not a, he's not a good poster boy for No, no.


I, I would be hard pressed to find anyone who that person is, his type. Even if he, even if they're a Trump supporter. I mean, You know, wild, wild that he was wild. That he was on the market for so long. Listen, at least Jesse Waters has good hair, as you know. 'cause you guys bonded because, So, 'cause we're tight now. That was, oh, Steven Miller. Terrible person. Terrible speech writer. But apparently a sexual matador, But a sexual matador. That's it. That's what, when you think of Steven Miller, that's what you think of.

Joining us in studio today, the Democratic candidate in the nation's closest race for governor, the former mayor of Manchester, New Hampshire, Joyce Craig, welcome To Pod. Save America. It's great to be here, John. Thank you. Got my Dunking Donuts. Nice. Just for you. You are running in the country's most competitive race for governor. Basically Democrats only chance to flip a governorship. It still hasn't gotten much national attention with everything else going on. For people who are just tuning into this race, what should they know about why it's so important for New Hampshire to have a democratic governor? Again? So, John, you said it, it is the number one flip opportunity for a governor's race this cycle.


And we know that governors right now are making serious decisions when it comes to, you know, freedoms and opportunities for residents in our country and in New Hampshire. There is so much on the line, reproductive freedom, housing crisis to address public education and so much more. And I'm running against someone who has a record of, you know, basically doing everything they can to, to decrease reproductive freedom in our country and so much more. And so there's a lot on the line. This election, Kelly AOT has voted multiple times for a national abortion ban. She has voted multiple times to defund Planned Parenthood.


You probably recall that she shepherded Neil Gorsuch through the Supreme Court process. That's right. And then celebrated when Roe v Wade was overturned. So, you know, reproductive healthcare is on the ballot in New Hampshire, and we need to do everything we can to protect that. So I wanna get into all that, even though I'm from Massachusetts, I'm a big New Hampshire guy. We talked about this earlier, but for folks who don't know, my dad and his very large family are from Manchester, where you were mayor. My uncle was the chief of police there. A few of my cousins are still state troopers there. And my grandfather was actually a Republican state rep in the legislature way back before the Republican Party became a cult of Trump. But I'm interested in like how the politics of the state have changed over the last several years.


So New Hampshire has democratic senators and house members, has voted for the Democratic presidential candidate for the last two decades now, but currently has a barely Republican controlled legislature and one of the most popular Republican governors in the country who you're running to replace. What's your best guess as to why that is and how has it shaped your campaign? Yeah, I mean, New Hampshire is a purple state, and we take pride in making sure we are understanding who is running for these elections. And you said it, you know, we've had a popular governor, a republican governor for the last eight years. He's not running. So we have a tremendous opportunity this cycle to flip that seat. And the last time we had a Democratic governor was with Maggie Hassen, you know, in terms of the, the house very, very close to your point.


And so this race that we're running right now is not only to win back the governor's seat, but it is to bring back majorities in the State House because things are so close and we have a tremendous opportunity to do so. Residents in New Hampshire have seen the extreme threats that Republicans have, you know, shown in the state of New Hampshire. And I feel like a lot of these things have really, you know, flown under the radar. You know, we talked a little bit about reproductive freedom. Governor Sununu just signed a very restrictive bill when it comes to voting. That's going to be coming into the, not my election, but the next election that basically says you have to show a photo ID when you vote, and you need proof of citizenship when you register.


So really, really restrictive. Yeah, no one's talking about that. Right? Reproductive freedom is under attack. Gun violence prevention strategies. We need common sense gun violent prevention strategies in New Hampshire. You know, you can do concealed carry without registering. My opponent, Kelly Aott, as a senator, voted against universal background checks after 20 children were shot and murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School. And so, you know, this is what New Hampshire has become, and it's why it's so important that we elect a Democratic governor and Democrats in the State House and the state Senate to make sure we are enacting common sense laws to protect our freedoms.


I forgot that AOT voted against the background checks, which was a bill negotiated by Joe Manchin. Yes. And conservative Republican senator Pat Toomey. And I remember it was one of the most frustrating moments for Barack Obama in the White House, that that bill failed, especially after Sandy Hook. And it was just outrageous. It is absolutely outrageous. So last time we heard from Kelly Aott, she was announcing that she wouldn't be voting for Trump in the 2016 election 'cause of the Access Hollywood tape. She went on to narrowly lose her senate seat. Trump of course, went on to win the presidency and then fermented a violent insurrection after he failed to overturn the 2020 election.


Now he's running again. And Kelly AOT says, quote, he's the right choice for the White House. What do you think happened there and how much do you see her support for Trump mattering in your race? I think it matters a lot. It just shows her character, right? I mean, 2016 she said he's unfit to be president. And so right now she is saying anything she can to be elected and we can't trust Kelly Aon, right? She's just saying anything, doing anything. But it says a lot about who she is. There's no way that Donald Trump is fit to be our next president. Yeah. None.


I wanna talk about your very popular current governor, Chris Nuno, who has, like, he's very popular, but he's followed the same playbook. He has called Trump an asshole, a coward, fucking crazy, and too old to form a cogent thought without a teleprompter. All direct quotes. But he's voting for him, he says, because of inflation. Like, what do you make of that? I, I, You know, I wish I could. It's fucking crazy. It's crazy. So, you know, it doesn't make any sense. He worked so hard for Nikki Haley, and then like she lost, and two days later he's fully supporting Donald Trump. It makes no sense. It doesn't make sense. You talked about reproductive freedom. So under current New Hampshire law, abortion is legal through the first six months of pregnancy.


And in the last three months, if there are fetal anomalies or medical emergencies, Kelly Ayat says she supports that law and wouldn't change it. Why shouldn't New Hampshire voters believe her? Because She has spent her entire career attacking reproductive freedom, voted for a national abortion ban, voted to defund Planned Parenthood. You know, in New Hampshire right now, Republicans have defunded our reproductive health centers, including Planned Parenthood. Oh. And she has said already, if she's elected, she would continue to defund them. The Neil Gorsuch thing, she's, she's, you know, celebrated Roe v. Wade being overturned. It is just, she, we can't trust what she is saying. Her record shows otherwise. You know, my mom growing up, she always used to tell me, you know, your actions speak louder than your words.


And in this case, Kelly OTTs actions absolutely speak louder than her words, and we cannot trust her. This is obviously a personal issue for you, as it is for so many women and families around the country. You were at an op-ed about having to get A-A-D-N-C after you miscarried. What would you do as governor to protect reproductive freedom? Anything different than current law or policies? Absolutely. New Hampshire is the only state in New England that hasn't codified access to abortion. And so what we saw this session was that Republicans actually put forward a very restrictive bill, a 15 week abortion ban. Oof, thankfully they didn't pass. But until we codify access to abortion into law, we will continue to see this attack on reproductive freedom.


And so I am committed to working with our house to codify access to abortion and, you know, increase access to reproductive healthcare because again, New Hampshire has fallen far behind other states around us in terms of providing the medical services that are needed, Cost of living. Huge issue in this race, like it is in most races, especially the cost of housing, which has reached record highs in New Hampshire. Aott has described her approach as build, baby Build. How would you describe your approach and how is it different than hers? So I have put forward a very comprehensive plan to address the housing crisis in New Hampshire. And as mayor, it's actually something that I tackled as well. And in Manchester, we now have over 2000 housing units in development.


I had allocated over $30 million toward affordable housing initiatives. And we broke ground this past December on one of the largest affordable housing developments in the entire state. So I've negotiated with developers, incentivized housing, and understand the challenges that our local communities are facing. I've been on the front line of this and made progress all while Kelly AOD has made millions of dollars sitting on the corporate board of Blackstone that is like literally, you know, jacking up rent and pushing people out of their homes. And so buying Up housing. Exactly. Yeah. It's, it is like the total opposite of what we need in leadership in the state of New Hampshire. And it is a joke.


We do need to build, we need to build now the projection statewide, or that we need 60,000 housing units by 2030. But I'm the only person in this race who knows how to get it done, and I'm committed to doing it. You recently said that you would legalize the use of recreational marijuana in order to help make housing more affordable, improve education, avoid a, a broad sales or income tax in New Hampshire. In response to your plan, AAT said, quote, Joyce Craig can smoke her way to a balanced budget, but I'm gonna do it the old fashioned way. My question is, how does one smoke their way to a balanced budget? Who knows. You know, and I'll add, she has never done a budget When she was at the Senate, they didn't pass a budget.


You know, as mayor, I had to build budgets, $400 million for the city of Manchester. I understand what it takes, and to your point, I, you know, would veto a sales or an income tax. We are seeing a decrease in revenues in the state of New Hampshire. This is going to be a challenging budget. And she wants to give tax breaks to millionaires like herself in the state of New Hampshire. She's not focused on what's right in decreasing costs for hardworking families in the state of New Hampshire. So even though my dad's side of the family's from New Hampshire, I was born and raised in Massachusetts, which is why the most personally offensive part of Kelly T's campaign has been her adoption of the slogan, don't mess up New Hampshire.


She's also accused you of wanting to make New Hampshire more like Massachusetts. Do the good people of New Hampshire have something against your southern neighbors or what's It called on? They do not. They do not. it is, again, it's really one of these crazy things, you know, I'll just add though, I'm a fourth generation resident of New Hampshire. Nice. And running for governor of New Hampshire to make the lives of people in New Hampshire better. Right. And we know there's a lot we can do. We talked about it and you know, I look forward to working with governors in New England to make sure we are focusing on things that we can do together to help residents and businesses in New Hampshire. And you know, we're hearing from businesses in our state now, you know, pushing back on Kelly aot because tourism is a huge thing in New Hampshire.


Oh yeah. And you know, you've got people from Massachusetts saying, well, I'm not welcome there. I'm gonna go somewhere else. And that's, that's wrong, right? Yeah. So, And I, I've had a lot of family and friends move up to Southern New Hampshire. Oh, I spent my summers at Hampton Beach. Yeah. Up in, in North Conway in the White Mountains. So, yeah, no, new Hampshire's great for tourism. Yeah. I used to work in Massachusetts, took the bus there from Manchester. And a lot of people do that. Yeah. And we've gotta be welcoming. This is not Yeah. It's, it's Baloney. It's, it's very, it's very Trump era Republican party. Finally, very important question. Puritan backroom, what is your chicken tender order? I do traditional, but I do like the, the coconut. I do wanna mention though, while I was mayor, I signed a proclamation that identified Manchester as the chicken tender capital of the world.


I hope you know that I, for People who don't know, I did not know that. For people who don't know, the chicken tenders at the Puritan back room are maybe the best I've ever had anywhere. What is in that duck sauce and like, why can't I find it anywhere? You can order it. Okay. I might order some of that duck sauce now. That's a good idea. Joyce Craig, thank you so much for coming on.
