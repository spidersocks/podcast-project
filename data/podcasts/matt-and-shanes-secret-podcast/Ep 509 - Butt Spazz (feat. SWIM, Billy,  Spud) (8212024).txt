And I was like, what's that all about?


She's like, dude, it feels awesome, And. they just literally, they just pump all the, like they start from your head and move down to your neck and then they go to your stomach and you have 'em in your armpits. And, they just like grind your armpits out. And then you have one like, Gabriel sounds great. Come on man. Wait, so where's all the fluid go? You piss it out and you shit it out. Is it like clear liquid or, so I pee A bunch. It's It is like a different type of like smell Out. It is a different type of pee pee. No, but you'll take a very nasty shit. Like there's a huge chance I wake up in the middle of the night. What do they tell you? This screamer? Yeah. Okay. I don't understand how how understand howand how that works. Yeah.


How's that? How does it go from your armpit into your bladder? The no nodes are all connected. The toxins into your, Because If your lymph nodes, a lot of them are on your joints, kind of like your neck, your head, your elbows, your hips and knees. So like if you're running a lot your naturally or like moving around, you're naturally kind of flushing them. But if you're still a lot the water, that shit just like pulls inside of you. So you gotta get like a, you gotta get them like manually pumped Out. Yeah, I know, but I, my question was just how does a toxin from a lymph node go into your fucking Yeah. How does that make You shit Shitter? How does it, how does it go outta poop? How does it getting into your intestinal tract? That's Where exit. It's just the, yeah, it's just the exit point for them.

And whatever cancer you're currently doing, You should try. You should go in the woods and take boost. Should try. I love be my Swan song Town say's Gonna do heroin. No, I said if I had a million dollars I would sit down with Carl Hart. But I would need enough to like Justify if your life fell apart. I don't think it would fall apart at this point. Like you either have an addictive gene or you don't. And the fact that like I have zero. You think you'd do it and not get addicted. I could take heroin once and not get addicted. That Would be the ultimate fall. Yeah, it's ultimate. It's like, Dude, I don't drink coffee. I don't smoke cigarettes. I don't get drunk like I have. I don't smoke weed every day. Don, Don Drunk. You can't pick up the phone or else drunk. You touch not drunk.


What's That Don drunk. I can drink drunk six beers right now. I just don't like the way it makes me act. So like when I was younger I used to binge That it's an's like a fucking alcoholic. No it's not An alcoholic. Someone who can't control how much they drink. So like the last like 30 times I drank, that's Like say like, oh dude I can't do heroin because when I do it I do so fucking much. No, no. What I'm saying is like I stopped binge drinking when I was 24. Right? Yeah. Because you had an an alcohol Problem. No, 'cause I was just a dickhead. I was a party animal. I was young. But then after that you're Just a rock star. Even when I First started, even when I first like got married, I would go out and have like four, like three or four beers. Yeah. But I was like, I don't like this stuff. I was hooked on like having crazy nights. So You were high? Yeah. You were high on life.


So I was like, when I was like 15, 16, 17, the best nights of my life. 'cause I drank a hundred beers. Yeah. So I kept that going and eventually I was like, this isn't where it's at anymore. Oh yeah. Shit. Rock, Do, You, Know what I'm saying get hammered. So It's like weed. Like I used to think you had to smoke like 50 bong loads. Tom used to get fucked up. I've heard, I heard Tom was a menace. I was a menace when I drank. I'll give you that. But like the same thing with weed. Like when I smoke weed now I drink, I'll smoke like two puffs of a bowl and I'm like, oh this is way more your speed. Yeah. And this is, this is better. So like what I'm saying is like I think you could put any drug in front of me. Like I could do cocaine and be like, that was an experience, but I'm not gonna be like, I need more cocaine. Are you sure? Yeah. That's what I mean. Hundred percent sure. Have you done cocaine like that? Have You done it?


I was blacked out once and I did it. Oh bro, Trust me, that stuff you that'll get, You try coke then Heroin. Let's see how it turns out. I'll 100% Do it. You should just go on a bender. Yeah, it's not a bender though. You gotta understand IAnd. But You should, You've got this like just hit One. I don't, I wouldn't want to go on a bender though. But it'd be sick. Like I'm not into compulsive re-dosing of anything. But you, you've never done coke. Like you can't compulsively redose. DMT unless you're bees are, well you Could, I mean like there's people who are like, like, who are like constantly trying to get fucked up. I don't do that. All right. Like I'm, I'm a very, like if I go to a wedding, if I go anywhere in public, I'm always sober. Yeah. Once a week or once a month, I will buckle down, Batten down the hatches and like get deep into my subconscious.


You should like drugs lab out and do like pure coke. I would once like if I had like enough like established Right. But I'd rather cover all my bases first. So I had like a strong background to judge them against. Okay. You know what I mean? So like I'm working on Meslin now. That was supposed to be tonight, but I gave it up for you guys. Yeah. Thanks man. So I'm gonna do that Friday. No one said it was gonna be easy bro. It's not an easy life. I've chosen It Is the Hardest yoga of all. What? What happens when you take Meslin? So I've only done it in like lower doses on Friday. I'm gonna do a high dose and it's kind of like you've never really taken MDMA. I think you got some speed offline. I think I did meth. Yeah. Yeah.


But like you know when you take MDMA and you get that like that, like that swell of everything's good. Yeah. But it's kind of like, I would be like, I love Andrew so much. Yo bro. Well I'm saying if you're on MDA like bro, you guys are So fucking, I'm saying, I'm trying to explain this. I hear you Re like explain, explain it less gay. It's not gay at all. I love Andrew. I'll say that. Okay. What I love my wife. I love Andrew. I love you Shane. I'm I I we're getting you each other. We're getting to know each other. But so on the meslin you don't get that like urge to spill your guts. It's just that feeling. But you're like internalizing it and you're like processing all where, I don't wanna say exactly where, but where do we should find out where he does this?


And we should get, we should get some nice Halloween costumes. It's not like that I just be like, Hey, it's my Friend's in Halloween costume scream. Like once you do it psychedelics, you don't get scared like that. You're Dying for real this time. Yeah. I'd be like, guys, I'm in the middle of something. Did you say on acid that you fucking thought someone was taking care of you? No. One time I took acid. Right. I was in the woods and I took like three hits of acid and as I came out of it, I was like so grateful for the person that takes care of me for like five minutes. And then as I fully emerged from it, I was like, oh that's just me. But it wasn't like, like if someone had come up in the woods, I would've snapped out it. But You like you thought someone was leaving you all those snacks and treats while you were On this.


I thought there was a guy named Tom. 'cause at the time I was connected to my like soul. Yeah. So like it was, You broke out of the net. I broke out of like the the net. The net of which I'm Trapped. That's what the h ancient Egyptians call it. So like what I'm saying with meslin is you get all those MDMA feelings and like, like see how that lamp looks. Yeah. Like that lamp would be mind blowing. Yeah. But it wouldn't be distorted at all. Right. You'd just be like, whoa, those lights are cool. Everything's cool. It's just that feeling. High on life. High on life but high on. But at the same time you're High on drugs, You're like, you're processing all of your emotional stuff. Right. Without any kind of filter. So it's like MDMA, but like it goes way deeper into you.


Any drug You want into, What's that? Any drug You want do off limits that Torah. I mean like opiates de Torah. Like I'm not that into, yeah like I'd say I would do heroin on the chance. Like I don't want to do heroin. But like if someone was like, it's not fair that you like doctor, the whole conversation was, I was saying Dr. Carl Hart's argument was that heroin and methamphetamines are the same thing as psychedelics. Right. We just have a different mean If taking off the meth probably, But no, he's saying like low doses. Oh okay. So like I was like, I disagree with that. And I was telling Andrew like if he took acid, I would take heroin side by side and be like, these are different. Yeah. That was my whole argument. I wasn't saying like, Yo, I need to get a bag. Do, You Know where I get, You know, The data is in on heroin versus LSD.


I think that you just look at the country and you're like, dude, it's definitely way bigger. Yeah. But what he's saying is it's a perception thing. So it's like if you sat someone down in a tent and you had a robe on and you gave them heroin, you told 'em this was a mystical experience. You can only do once, they would walk away from it and be like, I had that mystical experience, I'm good. But by the time you get heroin it's the channel it's coming through. Whereas it's, it's like the same thing with LSD where it's like people are like, this makes you freak out. Then you give it to someone And, they freak out. It's like the power of suggestibility. So you're saying like, yeah, heroin comes with a thing of addiction and by the time you get there you're already on a train of addiction. So you're like doing drugs, you're getting high, you do heroin and heroin fills that void.


But what he's saying is like if you looked at it the same, he's just basically trying to justify the use of heroin. But he's saying like it can be a spiritual experience if it was in a spiritual framework. That make sense? Could you, that makes sense. But it's also, there's prob, I think it was like when it first came out, when it was like opium and stuff, people were like Yo, this is kind of chill. And I think they slowly became like addicted to opium Like some people did because some people have that itch to like constantly I think like all of China. Yeah. They got obliterated by the fucking piss dude. But it's like They hit us with that fent. What I'm saying is it's, it's on par with like alcohol addiction in America. Yeah. Alcohol. If you could go to a corner bar and get clean, pure heroin, people would not have all the problems.
