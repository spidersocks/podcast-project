Wow. Wow, wow. Wes. Yes. Okay, let's go. Yeah. Did you see the Terrance Howard thing where he talked about how the man's like, kind of center of structural integrity is his butt hole. And he claims p Diddy was trying to compromise him and make him like fluid. He said once you get, he's like, once you compromise your center of integrity, which is your butthole, you become fluid and like nothing. You get all fucked Up. What, what center of not physical integrity, Actual of man, your manhood. Actual integrity. Yeah. He's a mathematician. So he was saying like you're the, like the geometry, like the underpinning of your structural manhood is your butt hole physical. Yeah. Like, yeah. But it's also, it's mental too. The center of gravity he thinks is your butt hole.


It's Your butthole. And once you, which By the way, I can't prove him wrong. It's Something to it, man. Man. Sounds like he's right again. Who is he? It's Terrance Howard, mathematician, hustle, Hustle and flow. Oh, oh, oh Boy. The hustle and flow guy. That's now a super genius. Okay. He claims did, he went for his, his B hole. Okay. Under like the thing of like lessons he was giving him like, you know, acting lessons. He said Diddy was just like looking at him wrong. He is like, this guy's trying to fuck my ass. Take away the geometry of my manhood. So, Sounds like, what do you think about that? A nightmare story to have to listen to saying to you, You don't think he went for Terrance Howard's butt?


But it doesn't sound like that. It sounds like Terrance Howard thinks that he wanted to. Yeah, he Might have, but he, if there's anybody out there that might've wanted to, I would say Diddy's a prime suspect. I can't, I can't follow what's going on. Because it sounds like There's a lot of people saying he tried to fuck him in the ass. Yeah. What, what do do you think Free Diddy? No, There's a lot of rumors going around that Diddy's trying to destroy men's structural integrity. I understand Those rumors. Hey, it sounded like the way that the story was being told was that Terrance Howard w Did he assumed it Right? Assumed it. Yeah. Well his, he had like a assistant that he was like, what's up with him? He is like, oh, Diddy's trying to fuck you.


So his assistant was the one who told him like, yo, this is what, this, What's that guy's name? Mr. Bentley? Or what was that guy's name? It just gets more complicated. Vns worth, Bentley. It's like, my boss is trying to fuck your ass. Get the fuck outta here. Run. Go now. That's a fair point though. Maybe he wasn't trying to fuck his ass. Do you think if someone gets their ass, do You think if Someone gets their ass fucked it does compromise, like their manhood from a like to where it like affects your posture and shit? Like you move differently after that? Do I think that? No. Really? Yeah. No. Do you have any proof? I have counter argument. Yeah. Gay guys walk different.


It's True. I think it actually helps your structural integrity. The posture goes way up. Yeah. Once you get fucked, It's true. True. You just, you start wearing that sweater vest differently. Yeah. It starts looking way different on you. We had a thing in grade school that like if, like Did you ever have it with like kids where it's like, yo, a lady's walking. Like if a lady walked a certain way, like she had sex before. Yeah. We would just do it with all the moms. Like, yo, like all the moms come to special lunch. Like, yo, she definitely had sex before. Yeah. If you walk with your feet a little bit more apart, that's all you can tell a girl had sex. Once again, these are tough to refute.


I, Dude, I Kind of hold to it. Yeah. If I see any, if I see a woman go, yeah. Anywhere near shoulder width apart, I'm going, what the fuck? Yeah. How fuck are you doing? What do you think? Yeah. Slut. Your mom's here to help with pizza lunch. Like, yo, your mom got fucked, dude. Speaking of slots, how about the space slots? Dude, how did I not know about that? I Don't know.

Just being like, I built a spaceship. I'm gonna launch you up there. Yeah. Man. With Gail King. Yeah. It's fucked up. 'cause he'd have another wife pretty fast if he blew his wife up in outer space.

And then they all started doing it. And I was like, guys, guys. And then one kid, they took it all. And then one kid was like, I'm sorry bro. And I was like, that's All right. And then that was it. I was outta candy. You didn't have any anymore. So then I had to shut off all my lights. And then any other kids that came out, I was like, well, are they gonna be pissed? You know, they ruined. That sucks. Yeah. Yeah. I had to, I had to like run Right in five, Nine.


Description. Two 20. Yeah. I, I got crushed one year. I held the bull out and I was like, never again. You can't do it. Yeah. It'll, it's big handfuls. You gotta spell you, you have to grab, dump in the bag. And I said, I'm outta here. And then I moved to the suburbs. Anyway. Just kidding. But I did. I did. But You get involved. Yeah. We talked about that. How you got involved in like a high level crime. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yep. That was pretty wild. That was, yeah. Terrifying. True. Yeah. So The masters were good. The masters, it was good.


I'm happy we went. But yeah, It was awesome to go and, yeah, it was cool. Again, just like you taking me was so special and it meant so much to me. So Thank You. Well, it because you're special. Well, Not drinking six beers though was a fucking crime. No, no. It's not a crime. It's not a crime. How many would you? Just one, right? Well, I had vodka on the plane ride there 'cause I was freaking out. And then I had, I mean, technically at the end of the day, At the end of the day, you turn it on during that panic attack. Yep. That was nice. All You guys went there and back. Yeah. Yeah. Got you. So you had, you hit, you hit your six. Yeah. Alcohol affects me different. Yeah. And people that don't have that, they can't get, I know it affects you different.


Yeah. That's why I wanted it. No, no. What does it do is like the hangover and all that stuff afterwards, The, the like there's a point, so like there's an hour where it feels nice. Yeah. And then it's just like inflammation. So then I just start to feel like crap. Yeah. Yeah. And Then it's like the amount that I would have to drink to get through that is like, no. But then, then I'm gonna feel so bad. Yeah. Yeah. The next day that I can't even enjoy it while it's happening. And I'm just like, yeah, you have an unbelievable constitution. The fact that you, the next day you were like in the mood that you were in. Yeah. Is insane. We were having fun. You did have fun. No, I can be grumpy in the morning. You weren't grumpy at all.


You woke up and you were like, Hey guys. And then you took a shower and then you were you's It's nuts. Yeah. Thank You. Yeah. I can't handle the hangovers, man. I fucking, I hate them. No. Yo calm man. Rallied yesterday. I thought there was no shout. He was gonna be All right. It's funny, you're like, I don't wanna have a beer. But then you have three cocktails of pills. Oh yeah. He's got, he's got no problem crushing pills. I had one pill, one lorazepam. Because you know, for fear of flying something you're not supposed to mix. Yeah. Oh, oops. Allegedly. Oh yeah. Yeah. You could do it. You're right. I remember the first time I heard you say allegedly it killed me. I remember like, you know how when somebody said something really funny?


I was, I knew where I was standing in helium. But anyway, just in case my doctor's watching. I know combine. You can, but anyway, I was gonna tell you just take pills then if you can't drink, just take like two lorazepams and like a little bit of mushrooms and just go to the masters. Right. Happy To move. Mushrooms would've rocked The issue here was, It would've been really overwhelming though. Shane was treating me Too. I would've laid down when I got lost the first time. I would've just, but the problem was I was trying to get their attention 'cause I lost them. I thought they were in front of me when we were walking. It turns out they just stopped next to me. And I kept walking 'cause people kept talking to me. Yeah. Yeah. And then I was trying to find them and I was just like standing on a hill just trying to gain attention so they could maybe see me.


So just everyone saw me. Yeah. And then all of 'em were like, yo bro, fucking chuck this beer. I was like, God, take me The fucking beer. It was the Georgia Bulldogs football team. Was it really? Yeah, it was. It was. Yeah. It was. The Georgia players came up and they were the ones who got me to chug a beer. 'cause it was while I was lost and I was like, I'll chug it with you. But now it's a real Yeah. Race against the clock for me to find these guys. 'cause I was on the cusp of being hammered. Oh. And then I, we were like going search parties in different directions and I, I was going his where he ended up where he was, I was for real 30 yards away. Yeah. Just standing. And then you took the hill. It was very close. Yeah. Yeah. Then you took the hill. Yeah.


Dang. But we, we ran into JJ Watt who is just an awesome Yeah. He was a man. Yeah. Him and his boys. Yeah. He had two high school friends. I think they were, that they were, I could be 100% friends with. They were so nice. How About that Dude O'Connor was battling with Oh yeah. There was just a guy behind us that was a roofer from Florida that was just so, so kid In the, of the class. Yeah. What was he doing? He was like yelling. It was really funny. Was he yelling out? They were just being LA and at the mass, like if somebody's hitting you gotta be really quiet. We were right next to the green. So dudes were like putting and he was like, Yo dude, this fucking wear all the squirrels. They fucking killed all the squirrels.


And O'Connor was hammered next to him. Like, shut The fuck up. Nobody Fucking likes you dude. Kiss. I fuck. Then the guy would be like, Fuck you. He's like, fuck you pussy. He didn't like to chatter During game. Somebody farted during a putt, which was, who Did? Former NFL quarterback. I don't wanna name him now. He farted at the masterpiece. Oh yeah. It was extremely funny. I mean that was a fun time sitting at the 16th when we were all Yes. Yeah. It was kids in class, you get, you had to be quiet and everyone there was just like, That's We, it's hard.


We get some rows make a put that like brought him right back into the mix and then Rory comes through. And that's the thing though. It's like, oh well what's gonna happen? But then Yeah, you don't know. There's no phones so you can't check. You gotta like literally stand in front of an actual scoreboard they're putting up. Yeah. Which is kind of cool. It's kind of Cool. Yeah. I don't like the scoring system with golf. They gotta flip that. Like negative seven wins. It should be, they should just give you like 40,000 points. That would, that would make it more, more exciting if you're league. Yeah. It's fucking embarrassing. Awesome. Shot 25,000. Yeah. Look at crazy taxi. Just be taco. Exactly. Then That's a weird thing too. They try and make courses longer. 'cause they're like, oh, everybody's scoring solo. It's like, who? But they're all playing the same course. Who cares?


Yeah. Who cares if it's 30 under as opposed to 10 under. Yeah. I dunno. Is it true that like, even if someone plays there and gets like 20th place, they still get like 300, $400,000. Yeah. That's Kind Of cool. 20th probably makes that really pretty easily. Yeah. That's pretty tight. Yeah. What's your, what do you shoot right now? Well, my handicap's at 11 three, but it's probably gonna go up 'cause I'm making some swing changes and I'm not good. So, so how does that work? Is your handicap like effective score if you play against somebody else? Is that like give like, you know what I mean? Like, if you don't play, I don't know how that system works. It's like, it's kind of a weird system But you just, it prompts me to enter it after I play around.


So I enter, I thought that's exactly what it was designed for, so. Right. So if you're competing. Yeah. Right. Why do they call it a handicap though? That's what I don't understand. I don't know. Because it's a disability. True. You're handicapped by your score versus whoever you're playing. But does that affect the score I'm saying? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, if, if you got like a four and I got a five and I'd a higher handicap, we'd have like the same, yes. Okay. Yeah. That's pretty cool. I guess it keeps it somewhat fair. Somewhat. Seems communist to me. Yeah. It's kind of crazy actually. I like that. Can you get the tags? If your, if your handicap gets like high enough, what's that? Like the parking tags you can park. You, You depart closer at the golf course.


I got busted in a handicap spot where I, where I get my wings from. I never, I don't take up handicap spots where I, I go to Nando's to get, they have like Great wings, just like wood Grilled. It was so Fucking good. We short of those. I should actually, they're delicious, but they're, I like the only parking spots out front of it. Everywhere else is kind of busy is like two or three giant handicaps. It's like a lane of just handicapped spots. So I always like pop in there, grab my wings and leave. How many spots? It's like three. It's just, but it's right in front of the place there. Front of, that's never three of them at once. Dude. It's just, it all of it's handicapped. If you want to go to Nando's and pick up an order or you wanna park out front, you have to be handicapped or, and that in front of that it's valet for the hotel next to it. And I'll pull in the valet and they're like, you can't park it right now. So I'm like, so I'm like, fine.


I back into a handicap spot. I'm like, you made me do it. And then I went to get my wings. I'm like, don't they won't be there, dude, the car pulls behind me. I'm like, no, he's handicapped. Saw the tags. I was like, oh, burning with shame. Just hopped in my car. That's worse than dumping. I Limped out. I was Like dumping in the handicap. Yeah. And you come out and you're like, there's no chance there's a guy in a wheelchair. Have You ever encountered? I Have. It's devastating. I took a, it's a family dump the family bathroom and I've opened that after a dump and there's been a family that needs to like change diapers and Shit. Yeah. They get hit. Those things get hit hard. Although they, they're kind of rolling those family bathroom is like, I think that's been the solution for like the Yeah.


Trans stuff. It's just like families or whoever and then you can kind of Yeah. You know, That's what I do. Yeah. Instead of like limping out, I'll go, excuse me, I'm handicap I'm a family. I'm a fucking family. That was the only thing they could do. They could, because it was such an insult. You can't solve that problem because then if you have a just trans bathroom, you can't do that. So it has to do just be family. They could do that. Family and friends. Just trans bathroom would be nice. Yeah. That'd be fun. Party fun People would be getting in there. Well, anyone could go and that would Bro, think if you hit it, you had to hit, there's the only toilet open.


You, you got the walk of shame coming out. True. I would put my family in the family room. Like I'll be back just in the trash bathroom. But yeah. That is a, that's a, that's a thing at the airport. I've seen, I've seen people go in and crush the, the almost the family bathroom. Yeah. And you just see a family waiting Outside. I've done it and then I'm, I'm in there. You gotta just be like, I'm taking my time on this. Yeah. It's a loan. It's a single bathroom. It's perfect. You can, you can lose yourself in there. You can, you can take your time. You can look at Instagram. You can fuck around. Yeah. That's A big, yeah. I've taken a long time. And then come out and seen two fam, like a line of family. He's gotta come out and go, you gotta come outta there and go, well fuck the hell.

You weren't, you were saying that, you know, you On the takeoff. I didn't know how bad it was until we left on the way there. I was pretty funny. Yeah. The Way there I had it be like, Holy shit, we're really high up.


Once I get up, I'm All right. Yeah. And the way that the pilot like explained it to me, and I think like this, this really made sense was he's like, you're not used to being in 3D like that. You're South African. Do the South African. I really can't. You guys can Try it. You can do It. He's like, Hey, Bri is there. Yeah. He's like, I can't do accents. Like try. It's fun. Hey bru, what'd you get up there? You know, you're not used to being in 3D so your ear hairs are like, Hey, this is totally destabilizing. Yeah. And you're trying to, you know, for me exert control over what feels like an outta control feeling.


Yeah. You can't. And then that starts to spin that derealization feeling and I'm like, what? I feel like I'm losing my mind. So that's what he's, I just thought it was a nice thing for him to say, which is like, it feels weird and it as it should. 'cause you're not used to it and your ears are telling you there's a problem, but there's no problem. I never thought about the ear hair. So your ear hairs just start getting like, what the fuck's going on? And you start to spas Equilibrium. Yeah. Yeah. Whoa. Because you're suddenly back and Yeah. But it again, the doesn't help either. Really appreciated the News has not been news. The news. The news has not been great. No, man, another helicopter has exploded. Yeah. Yeah. I watched that. I saw that one. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think I'll be on a helicopter, Dude.


Yeah, I don't, not a good time for helicopter charters. No. Even Though I was interested to learn that you can land a helicopter with no power to the rotors, but unfortunately it sounds like that one, they actually like lost power. Yeah. The whole fucking thing fell off. Yeah. Hold on. So you're talking about if the fucking, the Engine dies, they can turn the rotors such that it, there's enough Yeah, yeah, Yeah. Air being pushed through to like come down. Not super soft, But you, it's not a death sentence. Damn. It was, there's a YouTube channel called Smarter Every Day that did a whole thing. This is like 10 years ago. But yeah. That's pretty cool. It was cool. Still not getting in one of those things, man.


I've just, they've caught too much negative press. Yeah. Yeah. That last one was like, Jesus Christ bro. Did they hit the water? Yeah. Oh, Poor souls. That Goes my theory. Yeah, true. Whole fam. Bam, bam, bam. Oh, I gotta gotta Straight to Davey Jones locker. What? Damn. Now I'm not making fun of him because No, you're not. I fly a lot and I really don't wanna die that way. No, but gala humor, it was making me thinking about if that space shuttle with Katy Perry did explode and her hit song was, You fire You Work Would've been good.


Yeah. Man. I mean that's, that's criminal dude. Sending all those babes into space is Launching the babes. That's rec. They died. He could, wouldn't it technically be like reckless endangerment? Oh yeah. No. He'd probably get off. He'd be All right. Yeah, he'd get off, He'd be like, change the law. Yeah, true, true. For sure. One Step Above monkeys Set a bunch of chicks. Set chicks anybody Can do they survive up there. Then we'll go. Yeah, go. Babes are in space now. That's not good. Especially just Launch the space babes. Put the babes in space. Put the babes up there.


Cool 'em off A little. True. Fuck. I mean, how long do you think it takes for them to land back on earth and slowly like get like their ear hairs probably slowly get back to normal and they're like, when aren't you doing it? When you and dude, Think about having that over your babe. Like we don't go anywhere anymore. Oh yeah. It's so cute to fucking space bitch. Yeah. Fuck. I didn't like the astronaut food. The astronaut food sucked You out There for 10 fucking minutes. What'd you eat? I was hungry. What? You didn't feel good Because you kept me up all night with your fucking snoring Guys watching tv.


Yeah. That would, you'd get like maybe a nice afternoon you could see your I, I'm guaranteeing the car ride home. One of 'em was like, Gail was being a bitch. Gail was a fucking bitch the whole time we were in space. She thought it was all about her. Not that it's all about me. Not that it's all about me, but like, let's be honest, it was Katy Perry's trip. Do you think that'd be cool if you were Jeff Bezos And you just like, you have a wife And you send her and Katie Perry and Gail in a space. Do you think you actually felt anything or just like, All right. Ga, it was probably just another day for that guy. He probably woke up like, oh fuck, I gotta launch those women in his space.


I don't think So. I think he's excited. You think so? Yeah. You like Jeff Bezos. Sure. Bezos versus Musk. If you had to pick one, Bezos versus Musk. If I had, oh geez. I'd have to say El Elon. You like Elon better than Bezos? I think so. You know, I think like right now we're in a rocky, you know? Yeah. Yeah. What, why do you, like, why do you like Elon better than Bezos? Well, Bezos, it seems as, I like, SpaceX was before Blue Origin, right? Yeah. Yeah. He's copying his swag pretty badly on this. Yeah. Yeah. And that the first time they landed that Falcon Booster is, that's an unbelievable video to watch.


It's so, 'cause you know, everybody would say, you can't do it. This is a joke, blah, blah, blah. And then they did it and everybody starts chanting u s A. It was like, we're back in this. Yeah. Yeah. And yeah, to see this thing come Down And you've been, you've been jacking off to going to Mars for years. Okay. I remember that. I go hang out with you and Chris. All you guys talked about was fucking Mars. Well, Yes. Shut up about Mars. No, you need to worry about Halloween. True. You gotta focus on Halloween before we can focus on Mars. Mars Bars. Yeah. What'd you Say? Mars bars. Mars Mar Candy bars. Oh man.


Damn dude. So what's the Falcon? Was Elon's crafts? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. You think he takes space more seriously? 'cause Yeah, Bezos is just popping Out fun. Yeah. Yeah. He's kind of pulson. I'm sorry. No. Oh, there's this YouTube video. I just found it again recently, but I loved it. 'cause when they landed two of those, there's like a guy filming it and just the way He says it. 'cause you're watching him from afar and then as they, they're reentering the, the light up to slow it down, like the engines light up. And so he is like two candlesticks coming down. And then, and then it's like, you hear the Sonic booms, he's like double sonic booms. It's just a Yeah, that's kind of sick. It's Just a wild didn't Yeah. That's cool.


Yeah. Yeah. The guy who got to say that probably felt so cool would be like double sonic booms. Yeah. I have to say that into a headset around people. I'd be like, fuck, That would be awesome. We're initiating double. So I was down there for some space launches. Did You really? Or some. Oh yeah. I forgot you guys. You saw It. There's nothing. It's the coolest thing possible. It has to be. Yeah. It's great. Although the last time I was there, it got rained out and I sat on the beach all day waiting for it. Waiting for 2:00 PM 2:00 PM launch. I was like, I'm gonna have a good buzz by 2:00 PM. I go, it got delayed eight hours. And I was like, that's fine. I'm in the zone. I fucking, the sun's going down. I was like, nah, Shit. Fuck. Fuck that rock fucking bullshit.


And then a giant thunderstorm came. That's kind fun. It was pretty, it was awesome. Yeah. That's kind of cool. Listen to fucking Not for whom the belt fuck. Listen to a Metallica song. Do you wanna A Thunderstorm? Yeah. It's kind sick. Yeah, it was awesome. It was a great day. That is awesome. It sucks. The rocket didn't launch Pissed. Now my family that lives there sends me rocket launches every day. Really? Yeah. They go, we got another video for you. Sick. I think there was a rocket launch in San Antonio, or like, it was visible from San Antonio. Maybe it was from Houston. But yeah, the guy like Saturday. It's Probably fucking Katy Perry. You probably saw Katy Perry. You saw Katie. Maybe. I Don't know where they launched that thing. I don't, eh, probably somewhere else.


Well, I don't know where the fuck they do that, because if they're Sure they're all in LA so maybe, yeah, maybe they just hit like fucking New Mexico or something. Roswell. Remember the guy who tried to prove the earth was flat and he made himself a rocket? No, He just fucking died. Blew. I'd be sick if he got vindicated. He's like, I'm falling off the edge. Clearly I'm coming right off the Edge. She probably didn't think that on the way down. Like, yeah. Seems pretty flat to me. She pulls shit about to fucking hit it flat as hell. It was in Texas, man. It was in Texas. Yeah. What'd they launch West Texas success? It was Katie Perry. He saw Perry. You saw Perry? I didn't see it. Oh, dang. Yeah. Yeah. I was, I was fucking s sl away. I think that just to take the counter that, I mean, you got guts to go up there.

There's just this scene at the end of it where he is about to go into surgery and he is just like trying to ask the doctor questions about what the sur and then he just goes, mom, and he puts his hand out. And it just got me the first time She, I told this story. I was on a, like a first date with a girl. We saw that movie. Really? I had my arm around her and I was trying to hold in and cry so bad that I was like, my body was shaking. I was crying.

I, I like, I like can't wrap my head around that.

I gotta turn it around 'cause I gotta fly and I wanna fly anyway, so Yeah, we're gonna be Good.


That's cure for panic attacks. So if you just tell one person you're having a panic attack, it does lessen it. It does help you try to keep it to yourself. You're fucked Chris chain. Everybody talking to me. Yep. Yeah, you can't, you can't keep it to yourself. You'll Fucking, the way they tried to get you to not be afraid of flying, I think probably did more damage by making you fly a Cessna with a Guy. Oh, a sand. Well, I, I did that on my own. I thought that that would, I thought that would help. So, 'cause I was gonna go to internship in Los Angeles when I was at Drexel and I had had like a, a problem flying. So, you know, I had to go, I got the internship, I had a family friend that had a, like a two seater plane. Yeah. And So I asked him, I said, would you mind taking me up to sort of try and break me outta this?


So scary. It was terrifying. Yeah. He pulled it out. How did he he, he Pulled it out with his hands. He was like a 55-year-old guy. Hey yo. And he, the hanger, he just like puts a hook around the front wheel and is wheeling the thing out. And I'm like, ah. And Then I, and I was telling him, it's like one of the most embarrassing things I've ever said. But he, so he gets it out. He's going through his whole flight plan or whatever, checking it and then, you know, you can only get in through one door. Sure. Hey, yo. What? With a guy, you can only get in through one door. You set up a crazy in, you know, so So the 55-year-old pulled it out?


Yeah. Sweet man. Sweet man Taste or No, he and yeah, we just like, literally like yanked it out of a shed and was like, let's hop in this thing and fly. He, yeah. So we go through the whole thing of like, he's explaining to me what he's doing. He is really patient. He is, you know, there's nobody around clear yells outta the thing. And then we start the engine and it starts going and you know my heart, you're wearing headphones. Yeah. So that's helping. But I was like, is it gonna be this loud? And he is like, no, it's gonna be louder. And I'm like, okay. And then we got to the, you know, he's taxiing and we get to the end of the runway and he calls out his tail sign or whatever it is I'm waiting for in my head.


I'm going, I'm getting outta this fucking thing. And He says, you know, preparing to depart says this thing. And then I think, oh, somebody's gonna come back and give him clearance. And then he'll, I'll say, Don, I'm not doing this. Have fun. The moment he said it, he was just putting that out to like any other pilot that Yeah, I'm, I'm going. And he just goes. And so then we're like, you know this. And then the moment we start taking off, I go, I'm doing it doc. I'm doing it. And he goes, he shushed me. And then there's like some ordinance where, because you know, there's like, Oh really doing it thought And then there's so ordinance, because we were like flying right over a neighborhood, so you had to bank at a certain degree.


So I was like doing tons of shit. And all of sudden it's like, and I had these two, oh man, I had these two water bottles and I was just, they were crushed. And then I remember But you were squeezing water bottles. Yeah. This I, but I, now I'm remembering another embarrassment thing I said on a flight once 'cause this. So after that, then I went to Florida and I was coming back to my friend and we were, we were sitting there and the pilot gets on and he goes, just wanna let everybody know we're gonna hit some turbulence coming in. We're gonna rock and roll. And so then I, I, I look over, I'm obviously petrified and then we start hitting some turbulence and my friend just starts laughing hysterically.


And I was like, you're gonna laugh at your friend and a time like this. And that's really embarrassing. You lashed out against him the way you lashed out against Sweet Drake. That's not my, it's my opinion. I don't Like it. It's a totally fair opinion. I play it a lot And loud. I like, I like my music loud, dude. Yeah, you Do. So we're all yelling now. Yeah. So Do you guys like the loud music on the plane? Oh, that seemed like a bunch of nos. Yeah. It wasn't really committal. We Like the music too.


I thought you guys were B guys. Huh? I was just trying to play loud of music. Double take like, what the fuck did you say? I just watched them go. Huh? Thought guys are bees. Yeah. I like the loud music on play. That kind of, it actually calms me down. It gets me thinking about other shit. Yeah. I can see it kind of taking the edge off in a way. Which just blasting, it's just party time just sucks if you crash while and I guess you might as well be blasting music while you crash. Yeah, it's A difference. See that I listen to him howling. What's Really happening? Don Don. It's really happening.


Don, How was landing? How did Don treat you? Landing. Landing was cool. I mean, it just was, I mean, when you were watching from the cockpit. Yeah. And yeah, I mean it was scary, but it was a interesting experience. Yeah. That's kind of nice. Yeah. Those little planes are terrifying. I would never do it again. Yeah. That's how I feel about skydiving. I'm like, my wife's always like, we had to go. I'm like, I'm never going skydiving. Of course not. Yeah. Like why? What the fuck, why would I do that? She's like, it's fun. I'm like, no, not never in my life. No desire. No. Me neither. Of course not. I I, I can't, I just, I I never, Yeah.


I don't like mind heights that much, but I'm like honest. I don't feel, it seems like a lot of work. I don't wanna jump outta the fucking Plane. That's what I'm saying. Like obviously I would get nervous like jumping off a plane, but it's just like why even risk it at all? Shit, it's indescribable. Like it's fine. She's done it. Yeah. Okay. She loved it. I had a friend who used to skydive, he got like licensed to like do it by himself and he would literally like smoke a blunt and jump out of a plane. Oh my goodness. And then he would complain. He is like, they're fucking saying, I smell like weed. It's fucking bullshit. It's like, dude, it's a huge liability that be high at their place, jumping out of a plane. See they're fucking really all my ass about this. And he would give the guy who packed his parachute, he would like, pay him in weed. I'm like, not a good idea, dude.


Oh my goodness. Damn. There's a maniac. But he, he got licensed. He was doing it by himself like all the time. Just he like loved it. But I, I don't know if I'd, I, I, I'd want, I, that's the one thing I would say, I definitely want a guy strapped to my back. Yeah. And that one, I want A dude on me. Yeah. I want a dude on me.
