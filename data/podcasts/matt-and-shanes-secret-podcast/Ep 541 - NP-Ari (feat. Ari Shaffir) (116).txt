He was dsp. He was possibly bisexual. What Dsb p he got in a kissing distance. And I, I Was gonna say I think that might be, it might have been a lovers quarrel more than No, he did The, the first thing he did was blow a kiss at me. That is what started the conflict though. I oof. I was walking into, it was like an open mic at the time that we were going to, and I was walking past and I just tried to say what up and we got, 'cause we were clearly not like having, we were clearly having tension, but I was trying to not worry about that.


And I walked past, said, what's up? And he went and then, you know, So I didn't sock him right then. Time had passed. I went outside to smoke and he just, he was trying to fight me, but like in an alleyway, he was like, let's go to the alleyway. Wait for the mic. And was like's, You're a psycho. I know you're gonna try to stab Me back here. He's gonna try to suck you. He's gonna try to better Be. I just came back to the mic Zen. Yeah. That's what you need though. That's the best way to do open mics is with open conflict with somebody else in the room. So then you go on stage and do standup at them, which is so embarrassing to do while Fighting at any enemy. Mic in general, Enemy watches In the worst room where you're like, well all, we're all failing here.


Yeah. And it's like, you sucked. Like you're next. Yeah. You're on next. Yeah. And you suck. We're both here. I'm Not gonna laugh at your jokes. There's six of Us. I'm gonna whisper to somebody next to me. I go, this guy fucking sucks. Golly. Let's open mics. We had to pretend to listen until you get on and you can stop. The best was gonna those mics that everyone just was done pretending. No one listened. Like the raven towards the end. People were just fell apart. It was just a bar. That's nice. Yeah. Just So that people were standing and talking at a bar. And then at one, at a time someone would go up while no one listened to them. Let me Ruin the vibe while you guys are talking. No One listened. Dude, when I, the Raven, when I started comedy was run by h Foley, Chris Cotton, RIP. And if you like, even whispered, you'd have one of them like, shut the Fuck off.


Yeah. They were fucking, They ran it. They just Foley. They were shacked outta their mind. They were so drunk. They'd Going nuts. It would get hammered the whole, it was so good though. It was this tiny black box of a room and there were, it could fit like, you know, maybe 40 people. I didn't really do that. So fun. It started out Raven Lounge. Yeah. But it was like, it Would've been 2008, 2009. If you did heal him, usually on a Thursday you would go over, Jump over there afterwards. Yeah. Maybe I've done it then. It was So fucking fun. How big was h Foley though? Was he like G Fold? He wasn't as Big. He wasn't as big. No, he was, he was still, he was Still a lowercase Age. Still a young tadpole. HH Not fully. He was a big dog, but he was not nearly, he was, Chris Cotton was a big dog too. Cotton Was a big Dog.


That was a lot of big dog energy. It Was a lot of big dogs up there. It was crazy. I Love Kevin Ryan did a good job surrounding himself with big dogs. True. Kevin Ryan really is like that sixth chick who's hanging around with fours. It's crazy. He's like, he's he's fat as fuck, dude. He's fat as fuck. And he is like, nah, I'm so thin. I'm like, bro, the Whole time he was just talking to h Foley about being fat. It's So fucking, I never Even thought about it. Yeah. His guise was totally affected. It's a great move, dude. That's so good. Shame. So I had Lamar in the pool house now I'm fucked s a unit out there. I told you about the guy when I worked for an electrician. We, like, we all would go to a bar afterwards.


It's where he paid everybody. And he did all his like hirings there. And this one guy came in just fat as fuck. And my boss was also pretty poorly as well. And he looked at the dude, the guy like starts handing his resume. He goes, no, no, no, you're hired. And the guy's like, are you serious? He's like, yeah, I need someone here fatter than me. S like, All right, Fuck you. Thank You. I'll take it. I don't like it, but I'll take it. It's the funniest hiring I've ever seen somebody fatter than me. You hired. Oh man. But back to the pornography and you giving it up. Oh yeah Dude, I wanted to say that it, the law here does help with that, obviously. Yeah. Cause you don't, I mean, if you use sinks so low is to go to X videos.


It's so embarrassing going On. You so disgusting. Which disgust sites, You are still available in Texas. You're Dis disgusted. Yeah. You gotta, last night, gotta go through like the ninth grade. Where did I used to jack Off? I know it's, There's a lot more hidden camera videos On those. There's a lot of legal stuff. There's a lot of stuff. Yeah. I'm like, whoa.

That felt weird. Yeah. That's, But that they, that law that they passed it is helpful. I think it's good. Yeah. It makes perfect sense. It Just, I, when they went to pass the law, you protest it because any other time you'd be like, yeah, go ahead. Get rid of it until you're horny. Yeah. Then when you're horny you go, what the fuck have they done? That's what I'm, What have they taken from us? For me, and again, I haven't, you know, I haven't been tested now in like alone in hotel room. That's the ultimate. That's like, I mean, in my house, easy. I mean, you know, obviously it takes some effort, but easy enough. But like, dude, Yeah. Yeah. That shit's impossible. But now that I'm off it though, when you're, when you're married though, it's like if you have porn, it gives you like a little trench where like, if you're fighting, you could be like, and just go beat off.


Yeah. And then keep the fight going. But if you're charged Up, That's your trench. You can just be like, yeah, you go back to The fox hole. I don't need you. Yep. I don't need it. Fuck you.

They, I'm just reading a academic book about like guy slamming Vatican two and I think Mel Gibson was just fucking slamming Matt Vatican two. Oh really? Yeah. They were just talking about how it was like such a gigantic mistake for the priest to face the congregation Zoo Rene's. Mom and dad told me that. Really? 'cause they had Vatican three. They were like, people were upset and they're like, we remember our parents going, that's not Christianity.


You don't face us. That's crazy. Was Vatican II in like the thirties or when was that? I thought it was in like the fifties Or sixties. Or sixties I thought. Oh, okay.

I want to get a good homily. It's a homily. Gimme one. I'm open for the Homily is just when the priest reads something and then he breaks it down and he is like, yeah, he reads The Bible. This is basically the message for this week. Far Torah. Yeah. He reads the good part of the Bible and then he the important Part of the Bible. And then it'll be like, you know, non Gibberish. Part s a wish to take from that Your part. We're talking about your part. Oh, the non gibberish part.

And they were saying it was, it was like really a weird detail. But like, he was trying to like, they was going back and forth. Like I think Jim Jones, I, I, from what I believe he was saying, like I started that shit. That was basically me. I was, he, I think he was trying to paint himself as like, I was more of like the underworld kind of like, I don't know, whatever. But he was painting himself as like, that was kind of me, like the brains behind it.


Then Cameron, today it was pretty brutal. Is just like, dude, you were just a fan of ours and the only reason we talked is because You are, apparently his grandmom died or his mom died or something. Oh. He was like, yo, my, my grandmom died Free house. And then like they were like, okay dude, it's kind of weird. Like, invite us up to your house.
