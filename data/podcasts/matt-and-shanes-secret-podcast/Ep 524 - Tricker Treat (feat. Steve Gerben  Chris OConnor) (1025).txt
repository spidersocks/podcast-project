Well, I don't think it was You should tell everybody on the pod. I don't want to. Everybody's just gonna make fun Of me.


No one's gonna make funny. Well, This is the, so we're in the middle of us filming, which is, it's long. And then Steve's like, oh, I God, I saw him smiling. Film. He Saw me. That's all it was. By the way, I, It is literally, I the tiniest little raise of my No, you're literally looking at the floor going, He's imagining how bad the story's gonna go. Yes. But also wanting to say it. Yeah. Yeah. Desperately wanting to say it. Yeah. And the story was you hit a golf ball for, Well, so I, I golf, I, I played both days. Played Saturday and Sunday. This is already so boring. That's why You're fucking so tired when we're filming.


No, I didn't know. It energizes me. You No, it doesn't. Don't do that. No one knows that I need it. Otherwise I would've been more tired. We are at Risk of losing you to injury for, you're trying to go for the Long Ball. You, you to go for the long ball. You were, You were barely making it the other day. Was that yesterday? God damn. Well, we all got sick from, From One of the, one of The, yeah, it spread around. Oh Yeah. Yeah. One of the guest stars. Yeah. Maybe. It's tough to blame him. Fair enough. Yeah. It could have come from anywhere, Regardless. You're in close quarters with a bunch of people breathing. It's coming from me. I'm We'll see, Dude, I'm, yeah. I'm a suspect.


I had it. Yeah. Yeah. I had something going on. You brought it in you. But anyway, he saw me smile. I had to tell the story, which is just that I, you know, had this feel in my backswing. Let's also, I know you're trying to get to this incredible story, but let's make sure everyone knows this is out of fucking nowhere. This isn't like we were talking about golf. We were talking about anything. This is just, alright. I think about it a lot. This is in a silent room. It's in silence. You were pretty quiet. Yeah. But we were also, you know, we, we, we see each other every day. There's a limited amount of stuff to talk about. So I had this sort of thing to talk to you about. It's kind of the highlight money. Alright. So let's hear it. So I made a few swing changes and then got this feel that gave me a lot more coil in my backswing.


And I hit a bomb. Like, you know, I hit a couple bombs, frankly, coming down the home stretch. Yes. And my playing partner, you know, was like, damn, you cleared the bunker into the wind. And I was like, I never would've done that. It's a good feeling. Go. Yeah. That's it. That's a, that's a feeling. But see, this is the thing. I think it's only most people who don't care about golf. It's whatever. If you love golf, that, that feeling of connecting with the drive and watching the ball sail. It's just, it, it's whatever you're supposed to feel when you listen to Beethoven. It's just this thing. And I, I got to feel that. And I love it. It is great. And another, We were feeling that a little bit at top Golf.


Yeah. If you hit the golf ball far, it's fun. Yeah. Yeah. To have somebody pulling it out, you pump that and I go, I did pump it and then I had 80 yards left. I had a perfect 80 yard day fell shot, made the putt birdie. It played a You had a birdie. I did have a birdie. Nice. Thanks. That's good. Nice. That's It. That was my boring ass story that I thought of and then thought of his response to it. And then of course I have to tell it. So just walk the plank. That was, I do really want to get good at golf. Nice. Yeah. It'd be fun. Golfing would be fun. Yeah. Unless you're golfing with Steve and his buddies.


Get clean, sober, enjoying The fucking sober buddies. Enjoying the sport. Hitting a fucking one 20 Sober. That fucking blows, Dude. Although you said you hit it in the eighties, right? 86 on Sunday.

Don't I don't carry over the bad.


It's bad. I, I don't believe that either. It Is just fucking lies, Dude. You don't, you don't take it out on her. If you have a bad day, you go, no. Oh, come here. What? These golf stories make me really miss Matt's fucking dream stories. I'll listen to Matt's dream stories every day. I don't Even suck. I had some bad dreams. Dreams last night.

Might be the ticket. It might be like you're actually sleeping in your head. You are like, That's, I was, I was, but then I got so shitfaced, somehow I woke up in my parents' house uhoh and in a drunken stupor. I had like, started like a, a variety of puzzles all over the floors of my parents' house. Mm. And I woke up and I was like, I don't know how I'm gonna explain. Yeah. What happened last night? And like, What, the Fuck Were you doing, you kept making puzzles all over the like What the Fuck is wrong with you. Yeah, sure. So how about the golf? Yeah. Golf's better than that because it happened in reality.


There You go. It really fucked Me up. I'm not gonna lie. The puzzle thing. Yeah. Yeah. My imaginary debauch tonight. We had a nice night. We did have, we had a wonderful night. I stood my ground. You did? You did. You cow. I did, I did. You was A cow. What? I wanted to get to sleep so I could get fucked up. Went to dinner with our, our ladies and we had nice dinner, but we were discussing Halloween costumes. Okay. Of course, the ladies are, they wanna go as slutty, whatever. Sure. And it's like, you know, why not not do that? Right? Yeah. Yeah. It's cool when I wasn't dating you. Right. Yeah. But now, you know. Yeah. Come up a little. I'm sitting there.


I'm in the middle of, I'm battling both girlfriends. Okay. This one silent Judas. Really? That would Juda not ju denied me, Judas Or Peter At least not Judas. That Was Peter. I, I said at the table, I would like to get some sleep tonight. I do not want to open this can of worms. I think that's Fair. What, what do you think of that? I'm in the trenches doing battle. He even said, I appreciate what you're doing. Wow. You said, Which was a mistake. So what do you actually think That it did come back to haunt me? Not in the moment. That was a slow burn. That fight. Yeah. Yeah. So what do you actually think? I like when other people's girlfriends are dressed slutty. That's fine. Sure. Yeah. But Chris, what do you actually think?


What do I actually, so he was defending. Yeah. And you were saying Nothing. No, I, no, I was saying that we're gonna have a Halloween party and it's gonna be a bunch of fucking people from my work and half of 'em are 40. You know? Right. This is, this is not the time. Yeah. I think it's gonna wind up. I'm with you. So then I'm saying what, what is your opinion? Yeah. I think it's gonna wind up being like a bunch of just like our friends boozing and like being dressed super slutty is gonna be a little weird. Yeah. Yeah. But that's all. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. So that's, that's what I genuinely think. But but You can't get in that argument with a woman. Yeah. Because Now what does the other side of that look like? What is the other side? What is their argument? Yeah. That you're an insecure controlling fucking pussy.


That's the argument. Which is, Which is tough to, yeah. You can't break out of it. You gotta go fine. No, I think, no, that's The big missile in Mario. I don't, I I, I would disagree with that argument. I would say it's not about being insecure. It's about making my friends maybe a little uncomfortable. 'cause they don't wanna look at you sexually because me their friend is dating you. Yeah. But yet you're sort of forcing Him. So you're going, you're going sharia Sure. Law on this. You Go, you're mine. You're mine. Let's cover you up a little. No, and I agree. No, no, I agree. I'm not saying because you're mine. I'm saying my enemy's enemy is my friend. I'm saying because my friend Yeah.


My friends. It's like they, They don't give Brian six a boner at the Hollywood. Right. Right. But yeah. That's, that's never an argument. You can win. I've been down this road. Obviously. We all have. Well 'cause you get you, once you start getting to specifically like how long or short a skirt You are just you're in. I did that at the table. I was like, stop me, stop me wearing the dress up your knee. Tell me where the dress stops. And if you know, when you say it, like I'm saying it right now, it does come off a little bit controlling and abusive. But it was not, it was a fun, friendly conversation that ended up not being friendly, but at first seemed friendly. I was trying to suggest a variety of costumes that maybe, you know Sure.


Didn't require. I was gonna go with Frankenstein. Yeah. Bride of Frankenstein. Yeah. It's like a turtleneck. Full gown. Full sleeve. Yeah. Now that was passed upon Princess Leia. Princess Leia was nice. You wanted Clinton Princess Leia. Yeah. I won Cloud Cities. Princess Leia? Nope. Yeah. Slave Leia was, was what was settled upon was just metal. Bikini. Princess Leia was That's an idea. Frill. It was just like, no. Yeah. It's be 40 degrees. Don't Miss Frizzle was in the mix. I was like, That was nice. That's big. That's a big dress. Sure. I knew where that was going. Yeah. The scuba diving episode. Bi Bikini. They editorialized Miss Frizzle a little bit.

You're shy man. Yeah. I am shy and I think to make this costume funny. When the idea behind the costume was, I'd be like, why are you laughing Now? Know, keep going. Okay, We'll come back to that. Okay. The idea behind the costume is I'm an NFL referee. I do have like a little mini Mini. Yeah. You're throwing party fouls. You are Right. And I'm hitting people with the flag and calling party fouls. Yes. And I will say this has been done. It has, it's probably for 30 years. Okay. Then it's not Original. That's okay. That's it's not, it's original to you. But I'm not gonna do it because again, I just don't have the frankly balls to like go around and I think you do.

He's got the amount of necklaces that I would like to wear. I would, I would like you to wear those. Nice. No, I sent Shane a picture of me wearing the Jewish one that we talked about last time. Yeah. Oh, I wanna see it. He was like, I'm gonna kill you. You are not even Jewish. No, I know. I know. You're Fraud. Yeah.


When are you gonna get back into Judaism? Like I said, maybe deathbed. I don't know. Really? You think you had put up a hail Mary? Yes. Did you, you Did. You got like, did you get the mitzvah and all that Stuff? Yeah. It's bar mitzvah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. All right. So you've done all the things. Yeah. You're in the, Chris is looking at the photo now. Damn. Looks pretty good on you. It does look pretty. It does make you look actually extremely Jewish. I never think of you as Jewish until I responded with that. Yeah. Yeah. I was like, my bad. That was a little too Much. Yeah. I don know That's a good pro-Israel. Like Yeah, Twitter. Biopic And You are very pro Israel.


Ex I I we're not, I, that's too complicated for me to have an opinion on. I want everybody to be safe. Yep. Yeah. World safety. World safety. World safety For that too. Yeah. So what, how did, like how did the rest of Friday night go after the show? Oh, it was good. Just kinda hung out, drank, just went to Bon's. Okay. Yeah. Went to Bonner's, drank some more. Brian Regan showed up. That was six. Brian. Yeah, Brian Regan showed up. That was cool. He's fantastic. It Was an exciting time. And then I realized I was too drunk. Oh really? I got the, I got the wobbles a little and I was like, all right, I need to leave.


But I would still like to argue with Chris in front of everyone. Just, I'd be like, all right, I'm gonna go home. I gotta go home. And I'd be like, Chris, just admit Russian collusion. Just Admit collusion was wrong. Just say it. And I'm also fucked up. So I'd took a bait Hook climbing second. Oh. We had a good battle. Except Chris was outnumbered. 10 to ones. Yeah. Wow. I was bringing all, Billy was there. I got to just summon Billy. Right. Billy handle this. 'cause I can't really talk Billy get him. Billy wound up going, I don't give a shit about any of this. It's interesting 'cause I called him on the way over here. And. He was like, Chris is a pussy for that. He in in your driveway.


That's what he was saying about you. Oh, that's so nasty. Why would he say That's what he said. Because I was like, yeah, I, I got nothing. You gotta gimme something to talk about. Yeah. And. He was like CEO of Abercrombie and Fitch is a fucking pedophile. I was like, Alright, nice. I got that. What else? That almost Goes without saying. Yeah, I guess it was, what's his name? Lex Wexner was his money guy is the same as Epstein. I don't know That. Oh yeah. Wex got all that. Is he the Victoria's Secret guy or something? I think so. Yeah. Well anyway, the next topic. So someone I was saying that the other day, where is Ghislaine Maxwell? No one knows. Oh, you saying that? I was, I was saying that 'cause I was listening to Tim Dylan. Oh Yeah. Which is One of the best.


Listen to Tim Dylan. He's hilarious. It is so good. He's so good. I told you like the one thing I think it was with, but Hold, let's go back to the collusion thing though. 'cause that was the other topic. Can you just admit that that was kind of a false narrative. We were out. Now I stand by that. You think that was real? Well, it depends which version you think they were accusing him of. But I think everything in the Mueller report, the steel dossier. I think everything In the steel dossier that ended up getting the Clinton's got fined For. I don't stand by the steel dosier. You don't by that. But everything in the Mueller report, I stand by. But do you think it's okay for a political candidate to use the intelligence agencies to accuse another candidate of being a Russian spy and then using that, putting it in the media and letting them talk about it for four years unchecked with almost no, well, it didn't edits.


No fucking sorry. We made a mistakes. It didn't help that. What's his name? Did you Think that's okay? Trump Jr. Trump Jr. Was I. just wondering if you think that's case. Just could you Answer the question too? He me ma. He admitted it. I actually grew up middle class. That's how you answer questions. You Are Kambala. No, Trump Jr. Admitted it during the campaign. He said we we are Russia. Yeah, they were. They were like, yeah, they were like, you guys tried to meet with Russia to get dirt on Hillary And. he was, he released the emails. Oh, They tried to. Or they did. They tried to. Yeah. Well they wound up not being, they wound up not having the meeting. Oh, that's good. But So they Didn't do it. But the Trump, no, no, no, no. Because So Wait, he ended up not killing his wife.


So he is not a murderer. No, no, no. Not doing that crime. No, no, no. He, yeah. No, they kind we're Outta topics. We can just talk politics or Steve's jacking Off the habits. I don't have anything new about the jacking off. That's all right. You don't have to, you can think of something new. Okay. What do you think about this whole Russian collusion thing here? I, you know, don't know nearly enough about it. I think somebody was arrested though, from, Hey, if somebody gets arrested, then they're definitely guilty. That was another argument. But wasn't the person that was claiming that there was Russian collusion was actually colluding with Russia?


Yeah. Yeah. It was a couple of those. Just crazy. Yeah. It's ridiculous. Yeah. I don't know. They got, yeah, To me, the most alarming thing is the, and not that I know nearly enough about it, but the prosecution of Trump in New York for trying to get a loan and claiming that his building was worth more than what, I guess. Yeah. It was government. Was this the Mar-a-Lago one. And the government was like, that's worth 5 million. Yeah. And The Mar-a-Lago one was hilarious. There was a, I guess there was a bunch. Yeah. I didn't see the Mar-a-Lago one. Even though through my understanding, I don't keep enough track And, he Also ran its Own conveniently stopped paying attention.


Well, how much You are a Little kid that quits when he is losing in Xbox? No, No, no. I'm not. You turned the game. No, I'm not. Actually you were winning. And you go, all right, we're done. Turn it off. Turn it off. Biden won. Trump says, Trump's gonna jail. Turn the game off. Biden did win. You don't think Biden won? I Think he did win. Yeah. I mean he won. Yeah. You think there was malfeasance? Who knows? Do I think, no, I think there's some, some unrest in the country that seemed to be beneficial to one side. Yeah. That, you know, I will Say this about, I was thinking about this the other day that fired up outta nowhere. But that, I will say this about Trump. I do, the thing that I really do like about Trump is that if he, he's kind of doing exactly what you'd actually want a candidate to do.


Which is, which is like he's, his campaign and all the stuff that he does hasn't been affected at all by like the, like some of the trivial bullshit that can normally nuke someone's co campaign. Yeah. And. he is like, in spite of his party hating him, like for the most part, just going to the people and using them to obliterate like a democracy. Anyone who just disagree. Yeah. It's almost like a democracy That people, the people Vote on I just disagree With everything else that he's doing. But it's like, It is what you want a guy. It's what a politician, I guess. Yeah. No, I feel like, I Don't know that uses votes.


I don't know. And like, No, but it feels like there's more deal making usually. And then like the kind of the powers that be sort of like align around a person and like, and build them up and funnel money into them versus this really does feel like he's, or The powers that be, just get rid of the current president and say, you're out. We're not even gonna have a primary You are the president. This the Vice president. It's next man up If the president's dead. Yeah. Yeah. Well, oh, He's pretty close. Yeah, He's pretty close. I think They're gonna threaten me One in the grade. What amendment is it? The 25th, 26th. What is the amendment where the, the president's unfit 23rd.


25th Something. 25th. Dunno One of those. Yeah, they, I guess they, apparently it's in the twenties. Apparently they threatened him with that if he didn't agree to stop running this year. Oh really? And let Kamala run. I have seen a couple, which is interesting 'cause he's still the president, right. So I guess they didn't believe it. He's, yeah. Who knows? He's doing, yeah, I'm just gonna go with whoever. Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney would, you know. Yeah. They brought us through the darkness. That's before. Before. Yeah. They picked us up outta nine 11. Where are You? are you coward? You gonna let me do all this? I was, I was On the whole, you gotta that little you toss on it. That was an assists. Yeah, I did. Coming off the bench. I wasn't even done. I was gonna go to the horse, horse shark tank guy. Yeah.


What's the Shark Tank guy? He was like, if, if we prosecute for people like this there, there's New York's gonna come to a total standstill because this is like common practice. Yeah. And like in Inflating the value of your property for loans. Yeah. And then Deflating them for taxes. Yeah. And the, but the bank also ran their own, whatever you would call it, appraisal of that building. So it wasn't even like, they just took what he said. It's just what he was saying. Yeah. And, they still gave him a loan, he paid it back and then you're gonna arrest him. And that, that feels like Maybe a political persecution. I don't know. In A like real scary Way.


It is the hard part that I am dumb and don't know anything. That's the hard part. That's also the real hard part. But I'm sure there's somebody that's fewer, but it's just to argue now you a fuck. They don't dunno anything either. They're listening to this, they're listening to dumb guys that don't dunno anything. Yeah. Yeah. But we could be on some, you never know. That's Just what I feel like is the pushback to Democrats, which is like this, the idea that you've gotta let smart people just handle it. It's like, but then you create a precedent for something that you won't, like down the road. Like for instance, with Obama sort of the bombing, the indiscriminate bombing, I suppose. Everybody Like, There's that Jewish. Yeah. Yeah.


It's just indiscriminate bombings, I suppose. Yeah. I think he's violating walls and it's like, well it's Obama. It's like, yeah, sure, okay, fine. I might trust him. But then you're setting a precedent that anybody else can be, you know? Yeah. Yeah. And Kim Babla, Kim Babla is calling World War III is going That's my, those are my favorite Like memes. Yeah. It's like Call of Duty footage. And it's like me and the boys in the Battle of Beijing 2027. Because Taylor Swift told our fucking dumb girlfriends to vote for. Come on, we're in a fucking boat. Taiwan. Fuck Is he saying Kabala?


No, not he called. That's just you. That was me. That's me. You like that one? Kabala. Stop giving, stop giving credit for your average shit. He, I, you know what I was talking about you today? I was like, you know who is an incredibly good with puns and you hide it, even though I know, you know what? I, he's smiling. It's crazy. You pun game dude. Cut it out. Okay. Kirbys cut it out. Alright. About that. Chris, do you acknowledge that Do You Know, that that Happens? Yeah. I think he's, Yeah. Yeah. I've Seen it. Okay. Chris has been around it. Chris has been around a bunch. Yeah. Yeah. I've been on the receiving end of quite a few of them. But I, I was about the us being dumb thing. I was, I was thinking about that in the car today where I was, I was like, man, I, I wish people thought I was like really smart.


And then I was thinking about how bad it would be if people thought I was really smart. Yeah. If people were coming to me with like, real problems and being like, you're the only one who can solve This. You gotta set up that. You Gotta set that death row up at my house. I can't set the death row up. That's the kind of problem I can solve. That's, you're good at that. If you got a death ray, I could set it up. I'll get over there. I'm gonna need you on there. What is the death Ray? I, I bought a 10 foot tall fucking skeleton robot for the party. Yes. Yeah. It's gonna be exciting. Yeah. Giant alien that looks around. I'm never gonna put that thing together. Right. So Do you need a ladder for it? No.


Pause. I'll get on my hands, knees stand on my back. We'll be good. There's no way. No, you gotta build it on the ground and fucking set it up. Or it's like one of those things where you like, no Fuck did they built the pyramids. Do me can and figure out the logistics of the spirit. Halloween death thread. People are gonna be, they're gonna watch this spirit Halloween. Death thread. Sales are gonna go through the roof. And. he just walked, I walked into spirit Halloween. I said, I have to have it. And Then I got to the register and I found out how much it costs and it was not worth bringing it back. I Was like, fuck. It is a terrible purchase, Dude. It makes galactic terrifying.


Galactic. Yeah. It turns out it's more of an alien than a spooky ghost. But that's fine. Let's get this guy 10 feet tall. Well, whoa. That's cool. You're gonna like it. Yeah. You're gonna like, what's going on over at my house. Okay. That's gonna scare the goats. It is, I am worried about the goats. They're gonna get hit with the galactic death Threat.

Did you ever have a, like, share a moment with her?


I mean, we got ice cream. That's nice. But there was a couple other fucking cock bucks, a couple other fourth graders trying to cock block me. Dude, I feel like I was so bad at school. I like knew better. Like the, a teacher was unattainable for me. I never had a crush. Like, I always, every interaction I had with a teacher was a fight or just, you know, bad news.

And then every once in a while I would like really, like when I really got in, you know, back against the wall, I had put together like a good semester or something, but it was always, my entire life was just terrible. It's Kind of surprising. Yeah. Yeah. You're not dumb. Yeah. Yeah. But it's, maybe You are dumb. This Has been our entire friendship. I'm like, Chris is smart, and I hear shit like this. I'm like, You are dumb in fourth grade. Do, You, Know. How you have to actually be dumb I just don't, it's, it's a lack of dis You have to actually be dumb. That's Crazy. Well, I was never like at risk of failing out or anything like that.


No, but just, I'm not doing that. Yeah. Just couldn't, dude. I remember taking just like the multiplication tests. Yeah. You know what I mean? Where you just do like as many as you Yeah. 60 problems. Do as many as you can in a minute. Yeah. The mad minute. The mad minute. And I like I. just remember by number two, I was like, you're going too slow. You're never gonna get to 60. And then it would just like, it just turned totally shit. It just, it just turned into like, I would just beat the living shit outta myself until 15, 20. Yeah. It was like, it was that thing. I feel like I have the same like problem too when I, like, when I try to remember something and like my, if it doesn't come to me right away, I start going like, oh my God, you can't remember anything.


You're gonna like, I, and all I'm thinking about is not remembering Oh well. Like lines in a show. Yeah. Yeah. That's impossible. But even Just people's names. People's names. One sentence.

It's, it's fun to, that's how you get hooked in.


Because they don't really make arguments that they're Right. They're just like, here's the thing, here's the thing, here's the thing. This thing. Yeah. Whatever happened with you two? You guys were intellectuals for a while. Yeah. And. they, you guys Were like Sam Harris guys. Yeah. Weren't you guys like Space Elon Space guys? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

He's out there doing some wacky stuff. But I still like the, I I like when he, whenever he tweets to Tesla's doing well, I get excited whenever he tweets about the SpaceX. I get pumped. You guys are intellectuals though. You're big Sam Harris mate. Yeah. It is just, yeah, if you're, you're asking like what happened. It's the same thing I think with comedy where you're just like, I'm not good at this. Honestly. Like you, I think you're good. You have to, to try and have an actual, an opinion on something. Like to be educated It is really hard. It sucks. And not turn into like a douche.


Yes. It was just like, That's what you guys were up against. Yeah. Yeah. You guys were about to be going toe to toe with that. Yeah. And There's the, because that's where the intellectual thing eventually goes. Yeah. Matt does a good job with it. 'cause Matt's very funny about it. Yeah. But if you pursue the intellectual, what are you gonna give a fucking speech? Yeah. It's brutal. And, and also You Yeah. And you, You and then what your Whole identity sort of, kind of gets wrapped up in it to where it's really difficult to Getting focused on trying to change other people's minds. Sucks.

We were laughing because it was just, it was an empty, we were, we were in like Albany, New York or one of these places on the road and just during the day saw a movie. So the theater's empty other than us and like a guy like three rows behind us. And, he farted. So we were howling laughing the rest of the movie. We couldn't stop laughing.
