Every single dude That gets with A Hooker is like, who the fuck are you to to judge motherfucker? like none of his messages were That. Special And. Then the Jews were like, get rid of him. You're not Doing That joke anymore. So No Isn't That like part of the passion of the crisis is like the Thero. like this. The Roman Empire too was on poncho's ass. s About. Dude, Yeah, you gotta keep That place in Order. Yeah And also, It was during, when they did crucify him, it was during like A religious holiday for Jewish people.


So the city was packed like hundred hundreds of thousands of people. And. There was like 200 Roman soldiers in A. Garrison And. There was already like civil unrest. And. Then they were like, you gotta kill this guy. They had No. They would've, they had to. Yeah. It Is A Tinder box. Yeah. If they were like No, they would, the Jews would've. ve been Oh. God. Yeah. We're going get in there. We're going get you. What's the story? About? Jesus flipping the tables, the money chain tables. You guys were out front Fuck selling shit in the temple. And. he was like, get That shit outta here. Oh. It's outside the temple Selling Fuck merch at the temple. I didn't Know That. cause this is for God. Stop trying to Fuck sell shit all the time.


just Stop trying to make money. Yeah. Like Oh God A table. It is What. He Don. Hope the world go around. Nobody Wanted to do it. Everybody wanted to Jews to go to Hell. And. Suddenly Jews got rich And. Then all of A sudden we decided it was A. Bad idea. It is so funny. Yeah. That's s good point. Yeah. You weren't, there's No banking, right? Banking was like illegal. I. Think it was loans. Yeah. usy, I. Think you couldn't. Some shows 6% Or something. Yeah. usy or Us or Yeah it's called. That's like loans. But I also Underst Understand wanting to make it illegal. 'cause It, like you would money lend at like 50%. like people didn't understand interest. So if you understood it, you would Just I, Yeah, Yeah. I would've I. Would've ve been taken for everything. Yeah. It would've ve been like, you want 50 bucks? I'd be like, yeah, all right.


You owe us $290. I'm like, sure. Oh. Fuck. What have I. Don I. Remember hearing That somewhere where like the, the Pope was very close with the Jews in very time. They decided to kill A. Bunch of Jews. He had to like meet with the guy And be like, Hey Man, My hands are tied. It is tax season. Yeah. You guys know how this goes. It is tax season is s going be some real unhappy people. So They're going take it out on you. You guys are good at That though. What What. What bit money. Yeah. The money stuff. That's s s good thing to be good at. Yeah. I mean. That's at least my understanding from one book.


That. I read. Yeah was That. It was sort of an illegal thing. And. cause people thought you'd go to hell if you did it. They let the Jews do it. Nice. Yeah Yeah. Good for the Jews on That one. I. Guess Yeah just been like, yeah, we'll Do It. Yeah. They're Afraid of ghosts. So We get to have all the money. cause they think they're Going Go to A fire. Yeah. They think they're going burn forever. I wonder if Jews have That. Those guys have That thought though. just like on their deathbeds been like, Ooh, I. Hope those guys weren't right. I. Hope everybody I've ever met wasn't right. I bet they I. Bet you they did. Don don't know. Don't think so. I. Think I. Don't have That thought.
