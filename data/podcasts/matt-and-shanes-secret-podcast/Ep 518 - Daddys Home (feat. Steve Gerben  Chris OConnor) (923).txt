I was like, I got nothing. I don't know. You know, what am I gonna say? That's how it works. You got nothing you thought, we thought we had nothing. And then in the car, Kirby's accidentally spilled the beans a little. What he was telling me, he was at Wawa And. he was talking to Amy from the show about how he wanted to wear these nice pattern pants. Oh. And He was like, all right, here, I'll let you tell it. Misrepresenting the story. I, I got, am I not allowed to address the Okay.


Yeah. You address the fans. Well, well, no, I won't do. Okay. I've done, but a direct address outta Retirement. Back talking to the camera. What a showman. Well, no, Because it's So, I had ordered a sweater off of eBay because I, it was like a Lacoe sweater. It looks awesome. Yeah. I haven't ordered round shade.

I, I was, I was was the other side of the room for this? Yeah. Yeah. I thought, thought it was for golf though. No, I thought you were gonna go golfing in it. No, with Your, you were just wearing it.


It's just casual. Yeah. Alright. Patterned pants. What type of pattern? No, I, I, I, I didn't even want Pat. That's what I'm saying. I didn't want patterned pants. Oh. It was being thrust upon. She was, and she couldn't comprehend like the death sentence out. Alright. And before they think I'm an asshole, it's like, that's good. You need the checks and balances. Which you acknowledge because without me, you, this is what started the conversation. Yes. He said, without me. He'd be a jewelry man. Yes. He'd be wearing rings and No. And then he admitted he would be wearing bracelets car ride home. He spills the beans about what type of bracelets. And he's thinking Johnny Depp style. Yeah. He's talking tons of like leather bracelets, which, insane.


And then he also spilled, because all we're in the car and I'm playing music and I realize, Steve, there's not one song I could play that. And then I realized Steve must not like music. And He was like, yeah. I, I'm not Much of a Music guy. No. I'm, I have tried, I've tried to go through a fan. I've tried to be like, what do you listen to? I do the same thing. Well, I get to this guy in college, And. he was really like fish and disco biscuits. And I like tried to go to a jam band. That sucks. It wasn't my scene. No, that sucks. It's like A lot of that dancing like this. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. With the String. And, but then I realized the only song I know he likes is Pirates of the Caribbean theme song. Yeah. And. he wants to wear Johnny Depp bracelets.


He wants to be Johnny Depp. So then it gets worse because I'm like, you just wanna dress like Johnny Depp And. he iss like, well, no, I don't. Second later he goes, I did try the bandana wrist. He tied a Bandana. I didn't go out with it. I. just put it on just to see what it was. This was a, this was like years ago. This was walk around the house. You tried to wear a bandana bracelet. Exactly. But the, the thing about, Hold on a second. Insane choice. I wanna Know. I feel like I'm not that far off From a bandana. Well, First of all, the, I recently, I've almost decided to just listen exclusively to movie music, like theme song music. And Yeah. I understand. Rap takes a toll on you.


Yeah. You drive around. It's Literally, it's a toll. Literally talking about Jizzing in your girlfriend's face all day And just like, yeah. I don't like that. It's as close as I can get to actually listening to classical music is just listening to Thomas Newman songs. You know, Shawshank Redemption soundtrack. Well, listen, and I do think about jewelry every once in a while, but it's so not for me. I've never put it on. Well, I wanna go back. I do agree with the first statement that it's important to have a, a shame in your life. Yeah. And for friends to, you don't wanna Yeah. You know? Yeah.


If you were out here in Westchester, all, all by yourself, if we weren't doing tires Yeah. You'd be wearing a bandana bracelet At this age. No, I don't think so. I could, I No, You'd be outta control. I, Yeah. Without, without. I mean, The, the fame stardom has gone to your head, You know, how's it gone away? What do I have on my wrist? You Got that tattoo. I did that. You know that I had that. That's 20 years old. How dare you? All, all, All I'm suggesting is It is true. I remember, I think like, at least the time that stands out in my mind was I had made a video, I put it on YouTube and then Shane was like, you wore that shirt because you think your bicep looks good in that shirt. Yeah. And I was like, no, but yes.


Yeah. Oh no. It wasn't necessarily the shirt. It was the way you were. So he was, we No, No, no. I wanna do, no, he was doing, he was a sick fuck. I don't wanna go back. Hold on. It's really great. He was doing like a handyman YouTube channel. And then while the shots was him laying on the bed, like, then Why wasn't laying Oh, I Was, he was leaning on the bed. Flexing as hard as like No, that wasn't the shot. I was sitting on The head shaking, flexing. I'm sitting on the edge of the bed. It wasn't a whole thing. But the, This It was a very funny show though. It was was good. Don't try and throw me off Kilder the Car. No, I swear. Alright. But Was it, should I, I think everything you do is good. I really want my Dad in his retirement to start a handyman YouTube channel.


What was joking? You are like, I couldn't do it. Just dropping screws camera. Just Leaving the camera. Rolling. Beating Off in the room. It's A seven and a half hour video. He jacks off twice. God It is on himself. Fuck. Live streaming. Live streaming. Dad, Jack off. He's trying to build a bird house. Just keeps jacking off behind the shed. He's a goddamn phillipson. Oh man. But it, the Patsy, if You could tell me you don't want to like, wear a ring occasionally.


I don't wanna wear a ring. It's never Rings. It's never rings. It's like I do, I think like a necklace. For some reason Necklace has crossed my mind. No wonder you so hard. If you ever wear a fucking necklace, I'll v-neck. What you would wear Like a v-neck and have like a Yeah, you'd be weird. You'd be weird. And neither Of us, neither of us have the body type for a chain. You don't have a lot of shoulders. No, we don't. No, no, No. Yeah. I have a hunched over neck. Yeah. Half the chain would be laying flat on the back of my fucking neck. Yeah. It'd be bad. It is funny without shoulders and wearing a bunch of stuff on your wrists and It just, I know. I didn't want to bring up the shoulders, but the shoulders with the fucking giant death Bracelet.


Don't be nuts looking. It'd be chaos. It wouldn't be cool. It'd be like, if you wore a bracelet like that, I would think something happened to your wrist. If you got super tan and shaved your head, you'd look like a Yeah. It doesn't work. A street fighter guy. I tried that Shaving the head. Yeah. Yeah. No, I've, I have like a, I have like an old Saint Christopher Medallion that my mom gave me when I was a kid. And I want to make a necklace out of it every once in a while. I think I, I will never, but I do think About, I think you wear like a nice thin necklace. I know. But it's like, it's a whole new guy that, you know what I mean? I know. I'm not that guy.


Yeah. And a thin necklace also on me looks Yeah. Crazy. Yeah. And Then so you go swim. I've gone swimming, wearing a necklace. I look insane. Yeah. It's not good. I always think of really insecure dudes when I think of the chain with a medallion. It sounds like we're the ones that are the actual insecure ones. I know. I know. But I get to put it on Like, who do I think I am? I can never wear A Fucking necklace. No one would care. It'd be totally, I never watch in my life till I got this. Now I, yeah, I see the, I see what that's about. I feel like I have a photo that I, it's like a breaking case of an emergency. If I ever need to make something up to you. What photo?


When I shave my head, Lemme see It. No, absolutely not. Please. Absolutely not. First of all, why? 'cause I looked first, I look And see, but what the plan was, I was gonna like you, this was like Facebook time era. Yeah. Yeah. And I was gonna like say, put this post.
