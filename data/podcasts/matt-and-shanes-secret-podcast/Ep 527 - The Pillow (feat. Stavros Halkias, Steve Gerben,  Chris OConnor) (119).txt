I saw a homeless guy see spinners for the first time. Like back in the 2002 Ralph Sprewell. Like the sprewell rims. Yeah. Yeah. That's awesome. And Yeah, I thought it was very funny. He was like, What the Fuck? That's gotta feel so bad to be homeless. And a guy just has like show off rims just like Two pairs Of rims on his car that you would kill to live in. You would kill to live inside that Lincoln and this motherfucker just has extra Rims. You'd sell that Lincoln immediately for some drugs.


Let's not act like these guys are just like, oh, I wish I had a, well, He'd like to sleep in. He a rapper. He'd like to jack off and sleep it. He would sleep. Sleep inside for two days. Right. Get warm and then be like, I could go for some pussy right now. Sell These spins right now. The spins Would go first. Oh me? Yeah. Go first. It could be the high as shit in the back of that car. That's a good night. The night you still have the car and you're getting pussy off the spinners money. And maybe you take the radio out too. But. you have shelter to get pussy inside and a couple Wendys. I don't think, I don't think those guys need shelter to get pussy I. guess that's Out. That's what they're gonna go find their best girl. Bring her in there. But it must feel nice to fucking side for a change.


Do you think those boys are getting a, a lot of pussy? I don't. No. I don't think they're getting any ever. But That's what I'm saying. They're not Getting pus. I don't think it's on call. No, no. Of course not. What I'm saying is Actually, yeah, I guess it is because they're all drug addict ladies. Yeah. And you want takes 20 get shelter. Yeah. Yeah. A roof takes a little bit of heroin. Yeah. So I got some heroin. Exactly. And so what I'm Saying is, yeah, I'll take it back. Well, No, I don't think they're bugging that much. But Once I think those boys are getting sucked constantly. No, no. What is your theory? What? No, no. I'm Just saying they don't fuck that much. But this guy with the Lincoln, his first night sells the spinners. It's the best of both worlds. Yeah. Before he has to sell the car whole cloth. Yeah. He gets to have it buy pussy for $20.


Or it might maybe 40. Maybe you Splurging. It's not, you have to buy it. You go, I have some heroin. Oh, true. She's in the car. You go You are gonna have to gimme a hit. I think that's understood. There you go. You're not getting any heroin. Well That's, I'll kill you bitch. Get outta my Lincoln. You're doing All the same stuff. You're like, this is gonna last forever. Yeah, dude. Yeah, dude.

Lucy isn't like every other nicotine pouch company that's owned by Big Tobacco. They're like the mom and pop shop of pouches. Have you heard about Breakers? They are nicotine pouches with an extra surprise. Each pouch holds a capsule that can be broken open to release extra flavor and high hydration. If you know about your pouches, you know that the nicotine doesn't hit instantly and neither does the flavor. The geniuses at Lucy came up with a brilliant way to fix both of those problems. They put a mini liquid capsule inside each breaker's pouch. I mean that just sounds great. The only thing better and faster and more convenient than the little flavor blast of the liquid crystal hydration technology would be to just inject it into your veins, which, you know, thank God we don't have to do that.

You know what we all need to get more of off our ass, off of our asses with bold flavors and a refreshing citrus kick. Mountain Dew will get you off your ass and have you feeling like you're on an actual mountain. A mountain where the weather is always perfect, your friends are ready to hang. And a day of epic proportion awaits. I think Crack might sue Mountain Dew for stealing the benefits. I think that's what Crack does. But also Mountain Dew does that as well. It makes you feel like you're off your ass and that you're on a perfect mountain when in reality you might not be on a perfect mountain. You very well may on a very, very, very, very shitty couch in a very dirty house. Guys, what is my favorite flavor? Oh my God, it's obviously Baja Blast Code Red Voltage and original. I mix them all together and I fucking chugged them all day and I just bang shit out and get stuff done, dude. Talk about what game slash activity I play with friends after drinking the blend of all the Mountain Dew flavors at once. I mean obviously before we, we did a lot of wrestling last time, like me and all my bros got together and just like, just joke some Mountain Dew and just kind of like, we had one of those like dinners, you know, where a lot of people come together and just like, like-minded people talk about like-minded conversation. We had like steaks obviously, and some fucking, we had some salad and like, you know, the rule was that like nobody could be negative and we all just got to like, share how we were feeling and we all just like lifted each other up. We did that kind of thing. Then afterwards, we went in the brace, the basement and we practiced this like, it, it again, it wasn't, if you would've seen it from the top of the steps, you would've thought we were making out, but we weren't. We were just affirming each other, like right up close to each other's faces and then tapping tongues just to seal the deal. Guys, The Mountain is calling. you should answer. Grab your friends, grab a nice cold Mountain Dew wherever refreshing beverages are sold and do the Dew.
