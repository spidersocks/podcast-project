But he didn't come in very last place did he?


Interesting. That was the one. It happened to be the one female that was brought on the pregnant female dead last by a wide margin. I don't think, I don't think she, she must not have been holding. She's eight months pregnant. Which is she, I felt, I felt terrible. I was, I was laying, I was. That's with the running around. Someone's gonna bump into it. The worst thing you want is something terrible happen at a fucking crazy tag. I startled the shit out of her. I was laying down behind a corner. She walked. I'm like, s like, I was like, sorry about that. Sorry about that Dude. If she does give birth in a laser tag, that's our, that's America's next emperor. Yeah, it is. It's chosen by God. True. If you give birth under the artificial fog and black lights of a laser tag, it'd be just, Just being that your, that's your first image coming out into the world Surrounded by the team.


Fats. Everyone, everyone's sweaty with packs on. My thing is, I'd be still racking up major points, Bubbles. I'd be, I'd be sitting there hitting their fucking sensors while she was giving. Every Single person would be standing there going, alright dude, fucking time out. That's Your fucking Respect. You know my PS deactivated. You can't even shoot me right now. Matt, I shot you at the buzzer. You betrayed. I shot you at betrayed at the Buzz. Was you, me and James stand there. They're going three, two, Probably not, probably knocked me out of phone.

It's my great, I did find something out. So I think the reason there was a corner in the top. And if you try and shoot across the whole arena, it looks like you're shooting somebody.


Yeah. But then you don't actually get to tag him. And the guy, I asked the guy that who's asked bubbles. Yeah. And he said a lot of top professional players do notice that felt pretty good. A lot of professionals. He said there's two lasers. There's an invisible laser that does the hitting and it doesn't work at distance. So where you two were, if you're shooting people on the other side, I was, you're not getting points for it. That's why you seen the laser. I, I was wondering. I was, I was wondering. I knew there was a glitch 'cause I was definitely killing people. Yeah. You Now, you know, now we know Splitt Teams along doesn't Look the same way. Close quarters. New rules though. If somebody is running, you are allowed to tackle. Yeah, for sure. Trip. Trip or tackle trip. Or tackle for sure. If they're, if They're laying on their stomach, you can step on their back.

It's everything. It's for you. Yeah. Oh, I can't wait. You're gonna fuckings. I saw the trailer and I was like, this is, this looks phenomenal. It's the funniest thing I've seen since Tropic Thunder. Yeah. It's gotta be, it's up there. It's, yeah. Comedy movies are back true in a big way. Pendulum swung, pendulum swung. Pendulum's fully swung too. Maybe too far. Head down to the mothership, you go. Ooh. Yeah. Pendulum's maybe swung a little too far. Not everyone has to say it. True. Every single set, Dude, the, I I, I think we're in like the seven, we're in like the new version of the seventies now.


We've left like the, we had like a version of the sixties, like the Hippie Dream, which was just like state sponsored basically propaganda at this point with just like the super woke stuff. It's completely fallen apart. Now we're in the seventies. I got evil hippies. Exactly. And then we're about to hit the eighties pretty soon, which will be sweet. Yes. We're about to have a new eighties. The thirties. Nineties are gonna be the eighties. We're the Seventies. We're be dying during the nineties, which is a good time to die. Nineties is the best one. I Exactly. Yeah. It's a good time to die. Yeah. So when We're 50, we're all gonna be in the nineties. It's gonna be sick as hell. 60. 60. Yeah. True. It's All right. Nine eleven's gonna be really rough. It's gonna be, Maybe we'll do it though. Maybe it'll be ours. He's a downer. I'm sorry. It's gonna be depressing. 11 dude.


You think the Middle East will still be there in the new nineties? Dude? Man, there's gonna be casinos, there'll be the, this is gonna be Trump Casino. It's gonna be the other Riviera, the Mediterranean. You'll probably do a VR nine. You'll do like a, it'll be nine 11 will be like a ride at Universal Studios. You'll be in the building. If you have the lightning pass, I'll be like, Hey, we actually know about an attack. We're gonna get you guys out before it's coming. Yeah. Tower seven will be that haunted one to just drop outta nowhere. Tower of Terror. Tower of Terror. You just go, oh, we're dropping somehow. Tower seven of terror against all odds we're dropping.


Oh my God. Yeah. That'll be awesome. But yeah, yeah, it definitely, it's heartening news. We are the pendulum's fully swung, the pendulum swung the dream broke. But the residue of it, just like the hippie dream will still, you know, know, kind of saturate the culture, but it'll just be like breakfast. It'll like blend into like ice cream stuff. Damn. The hipsters were kind of fun at first. Huh? You remember like 2010? Yeah. They were kind of nice, nice group of people. It Was Nick and Nora's infinite playlist. It was, and then they, And I was at the right age to be gay enough for it. I fucking love that shit. And then they turned you, what Did you love about it? I just liked all the music freedom.


Yeah. Yeah. The dawn of a new age, Like the gay music LCD sound system still rules Shit. Does fucking rule All that. Yeah. That shit rules. Yeah. I don't know what happened. I'm telling you dude, it was Occupy Wall Street and then it just total psyop and they turned into still, still wearing masks today. Which is, it's unsettling when you see a guy, just a dude by, it's like, it's like maybe you're visiting your grandmom, but like, I don't know. I've said it before. If you're grand, if you're like a grandmom or grandfather and you're worried about that, it's like, I think you've kind of failed at life. Yeah. Why Don't you shut up. You're just Pussy. It's like, if you're 80 and you're worried about covid, you've, you're a pussy. Even if you don't die of covid, you're gonna be a puss. Definitely The people that should be worried about though. For sure. Yeah. But it's, you imagine 80, you don't wanna die like that.


You don't wanna die. Well, I guess they all do die of pneumonia. Yeah. Eventually. Yeah. You can't Be scared of death by the time you're 80. I mean, it's close. It's easier said than done, obviously. But dude, when you're like making your grandkids get like experimental therapeutics. Yeah. So they can chill with you, I think, I don't think that many grandparents were doing that. I think the grandparents were like, why can't they come inside? True. I wanna Hold my grandson. He is outside of the window because it's true. Fauci. Then they duck. Yeah, I did my part. What up Nate? What Up big unc? What up? Y'all We're just all coming clean here. Yeah. I mean, I'm sorry. I shouldn't, I shouldn't rag on 80 year olds, but I That's Fine. Just I pray by the time I'm 80, I'm not gonna be scared of some fucking bullshit ass Take like the moral high ground.


I'm just thinking of when I was eight, when I was 80. If I was ever 80, which past life transgression no shot. I, I, I hope by the time I'm 80, I'm truly not afraid of death. That's, I hope I'll be trying to Get the 40 staring 40 now going, holy shit. Oh yeah. You gotta get on the fucking good foot. It's time, it's time, it's time to get a blood panel. That's gonna be a real bummer. Yeah. Trust me, I got mine. Mine was not great. Yeah, it's gonna be a bummer. Although right now, I'm, I'm I, I've said it before, but I, I always stray from this. I don't care about aesthetics. I'm going just performance. I go, I toggle back and forth. It's like, can I just be coming Adonis and then I just get fatter every day and they go, Nope, nope, nope, nope.


So I'm, I'm going just pure performance now. I don't, I don't, it doesn't care. Weight don't care. I don't care about any of it. I'm just, I'm caring about mile times hang time. I mean, I think I got like a one, I think one 40 hang time, whatever. It's not big deal, but It's fucking hard. I believe you. Yeah. It's cool. Awesome. Probably could talk about fitness shit, dude. Hang times. Hang time's. Tough. Dude. That does blow Hang time's. It's hard. Yeah. I'm in, I'm in a stiff competition with Billy right now. Billy got one. You might get him on the hang time. Did you ever see his fucking hands? Yeah, but he's big. Yeah, But he's got fucking fat. He does have paws. Yeah, He is for real, like dog paws. He does. So I, right now we're tied, but I I, I gotta overtake him for sure in the hang time.


It's weird. They're saying like, that's all that matters. Everyone's worried about covid, but they're like, if your thighs are jacked And you can squeeze stuff really hard, you're not gonna die. So I actually believe That. I'm telling you, they're saying if you have like, thank God I have Jack thos grip. Exactly. They're saying grip strength and like muscle density in your legs are a bigger indicator. Jack ties win the grip strength every time at Rogan's other than Rogan. Not a big deal. Yeah, man. So Fuck you looking at it, Adam, you're ass lost. What, What was, what's the poundage on the grip strength? I think I got, it was like 1 45 last time. That's good. And then no one could beat it. So I, I only went once. I was like, All right, good. That's Good.

I could see, I could see them doing some nasty false flag like that against him. I'd be on their bumper. I'd be on the CIA's bumper if that happens. You're already on the cia.


They're probably on your bumper after they found out that fucking hang time. They're probably like, holy shit. It's Jason bor. He's a sleeper cell. Nah, I am definitely on the CIA's bumper. I just got a fucking laser tag on the brain. I do too. So we can cut and then come back in. Yeah, let's get's get one more. Let tag one more t for sure. We'll be right back. One more laser tag. Yeah.

Get him on the ramp. Anyway. What else is going on? Not much, man. I'm fuck. What else is going on, dude? How was SNL? You could, There we go. Talk about that. I got that. There we go. It was After a week in laser tag. Yeah, Yeah. Yeah. Laser tag is more important.


It was, it was easier the second time. That's nice. But the one thing that sucks is, you know what's coming the second time. So the first time you go through and you're like, All right, Monday that was easy. Tuesday that was easy. And all of a sudden you do everything on Friday, you film all those pre-recorded sketches. You film. Yeah. So you're there. We had to get there at like six, 6:00 AM You got like, pick up at five 30 and then you get done at fucking 2:00 AM and Then you gotta do the real thing the next Day. And then you wake up the next day. Oh. Why do they do it that way? I don't know. That sounds good. Why not? Yeah. Do that first. I have no idea. Rest up. Yeah. Maybe just to get you jacked up and like juiced up. I don't know. Get you, you know, I was, It was, it was actually, I mean, it doesn't matter how late you stay up when you do the rehearsal live.


Yeah. It's the scariest. If they ever showed that monologue, I did. Oh yeah. It's fucking nuts out there. Oh fuck. It's the most nervous I've ever been. And then the real show. I was uncomfortably not nervous. That's, That's a good idea. I Was like, oh, this isn't good. Yeah. Giving you the run through is a genuinely good idea. Yeah. Every, every sketch you're nervous. You're like, fuck, I can't read. That's dude that Read off, off everyone's, I've talked to people before, like, yeah, you can read off a card. I'm like, dude, I can hardly read books to my kids. I you Gotta read the card. Like you're telling a joke that's tough. You're like, no, I don't know. And then they change the lines in between rehearsal and the real show. I'll Tell you what I would do. I would fuck the just new lines. I'd fuck the first card up immediately and I'd think about it the rest of the time and I'd fuck up every single card after that.


That, so that's my prediction for sure. That's What I would Do. So we did rehearsal and we did another Jamaican church sketch and I think I fucked it up so bad. They were like, it's not that good. What? Yeah. That's what happened. You, you do a sketch and then they're like, All right, we're not gonna use that. And you're like, fuck. That was my fault. 'cause that was definitely funny. Now this shouldn't have went back to the Well, did Jamaican. Well, I liked the Well, I know It's, I love it. It's funny every single time. Damn. Exactly right. They had, they had Jamaican part two, They did have Jamaican parti and I think I fucked it up. I, you know. Nah, you never know. They're not gonna tell you. You Never know.

How did, how, what did they, were they just, they did Like it. That's cool. The monologue went well, but the, that's cool. The rehearsal. Who were the, who were the fans?
