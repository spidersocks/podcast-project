That'd be fine. Let's just start. Fuck it. Yeah. Hey. Yeah, it was, I thought it was, I thought it was, could have been house again. Nah, we, we actually have that coming. We, we, we shot that, but we haven't done that. All right. I watched season one. It was great. Yeah, It was, man, it's, it's hilarious. It's very interesting. I'll tell you that. Yeah. We've got some interesting characters involved. Really. It was insane. People. Do you cast yourself or do you have like a casting as you bring It up? Like, majority of them will come from like, the auditions. Like, we'll go to different cities Yeah. And have like auditions and shit. But then you still have your, you know, freshly picked from social medias Yeah. In there. And I'm sure you know, you, you, you've scrolled and seen some, We've watched, we watch the auditions here.


Yeah, yeah. Yeah. We usually, before we film or after we, we've, we're fans, we toss on the auditions. Yeah. So what, what is the show again? Explain that. I wanna know. All right. So Coulda Been Love is different from coulda been housed, could have been. House is necessarily, it has something to do with the auditions. You know, we go to each city, do auditions, you know, if you have good music, if you have good talent, whatever. We put them all in a house. The best of the best getting to the house for that season. So last year we did season one. It was kind of like making the band Yeah. Back in the day. Like where, you know, you, you're competing for money, you bring your around celebrities. We had Snoop Dogg, we had all these different people. This year we've got a whole different setup. It's the same type vibe. Yeah. But more celebrities.


Everything. The risk is higher, more money. Yep. So that'll be season two. Coulda Been Love is the first time we've ever done this. Coulda Been Love is necessarily has to do with me trying. You're Trying to find love, Trying to find a woman. Damn. Yeah. You're trying to find that, you know, trying to find something that makes sense for me and for sure. Yeah. Just a conventional, healthy way. Yeah. Like the newfound Fame, You know what I mean? Like, You get it. RIP Diddy for making the band. Dude, that was a great show for sure. Damn. So, yeah. You're trying to find the one. He didn't die though, man. He just, I, I mean, he probably wishes it, he probably wishes he did. All Right. It's coming. He, Yeah. Yeah. Hopefully he doesn't fucking get sad. Like Jeffrey Epstein did. Yeah. And fucking kill himself. So, so you're just trying to find the one they're gonna come on tv.


Yeah. I think it's mainly about just me getting that connection with a girl, man. And, you know, which is hard when you're, Are You, are you gonna abstain though? You should mind fuck them and abstain the whole time. What is abstain? Don't, don't fuck them. Oh, okay. Yeah. Is that what that means? Yeah. Yeah. I thought he was, I thought you were still saying Epstein. No, no, no, no. You Are abstain. No. Are You are gonna keep It chased yours. Okay. This is bordering on. No, it's not. It has nothing to do with that at all. House. The house of women Together. It's nothing like that. But there, everybody's over 21 for sure. For Sure. For sure. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Well, that sucks. What the, I'm not gonna watch it.


It kind of ruins whole fucking thing, Man. I might not even need to do this podcast, So I don't even get the fuck outta here. How would, how would a girl like capture your heart? They're in the house. Yeah. Yeah. So pretty much would ride up pretty much like, yeah, we put 'em all in there, but we put 'em through different things. Like, we brought celebrities to like, see if they could go through each competition. So like, one day we brought like Bobby Altoff, and then the next day they get to meet Young Ma. You know what I mean? So we have a lot of different celebrities in there that put them through the ringer of like, are you good enough for Druski? Are you here for the money? Because they also are competing for $50,000. Yeah. Okay. So it's not just about like, my love and everything. We, we, we made a catch.


You know? 'cause we also want them to, you know, get compensated for their, How many of the women are white? Good. Like two or three? That's a good question. Two or three Outta 18. Like two or three. Okay. All Right. Yeah. I think three. Yeah. That's good. Yeah. One is mixed. That's good. Yeah. Is that good enough for you? No. I just wondering what the fuck if the show's about black Love or not. Yeah. Well, it's about a little bit. No, no, no. We actually have all races. Like we have, we have a Mexican girl. We got a couple studs girls. Stu, you got some Studs? Yeah. Yeah. Race. There's a mixture of a lot of shit, man. Dude, We've been following reform. There's like a whole thing of reformed studs on Instagram. Yeah, bro. There's a, there's, but see, they're all the same.


Yeah. Everybody, they, they, they have these things now where they're calling them like, stems or fem or, you know, like, so it's like a, a stud, feminine type mixture. Whoa. Yeah. They're not all just, it's not, I know back in the day, everybody's like, oh, that's a stud. Now they got these new titles. It's like, it, it has branched out. Damn it. So we had, yeah, we had a mixture of a bunch, man. It was like picking through a, a batch. So what are, are the studs, like chaos agents? Like what are the studs gonna do? Yeah. What Are the studs? No, the studs. Some of them, like I said, there, there's like, there's like a new stud Thing. They're straight studs where Yeah, they're, they're kind of like, they still look for a man. Maybe not for love. Just a friend, maybe more. So, yeah. Like, kind of like a mentor, You know what I mean?


Stud s A vibe. That's the vibe I get of it. I think it's more like a, like a brother, like searching for a brother. But, you know, I, I said even on the show, like man, it's like I have no problem with 'em. You could share clothes with 'em and shit. So I think, I think it works out for me somehow. Some way. Yeah. It, it, it, it, it is a good show though. It'll Be, although what it, they can get activated and get on like, on like a steal your girl mission. Cause they do pride themselves on able To steal any issues, girl. Yeah. That's the issue we had on the show, man. Yeah. They, they, a lot of them were trying to indulge in like, getting with the regular girls. And I had to discipline them for that. Yeah. It was a whole thing. How, how do you keep your studs in line? That's thing, man. That's why Yeah. We, we discipline them. Yeah. Yeah. They, they go through, those Are separate room. Yeah. They have their, Where are you putting them?


We don't put 'em anywhere in the house. It's not like we're putting them. You gotta Put them. Yeah. You're trying to do the whole r Kelly thing. S like, yeah. Where do y'all put them? Nah, everybody, everybody had, they, they gotta choose their own rooms. We didn't put 'em anywhere, but it's a big house though. So it's, you know, you can only imagine it's 18 girls, So God. Yeah. Damn. How long were you guys in there for? Hopefully forever. Full. Hopefully. Forever. Yeah. Muslims kill themselves a full week. A full week. We were in, you know that, huh? A lot of Muslims have killed themselves through that exact scenario. Are you really? Yeah. It's 72, but yes. God damn. It's a heaven. Yeah. I haven't heard of that. I don't know nothing About that. No. Yeah. You didn't know that? Nah, that's where they get promised. They get literally get promised 72 versions when they Yeah.


Like blow up a school bus. They're supposed to be greeted by 72. Wow. Virgins too bad. Not just like, maybe fucked around a little bit, but like Versions. Yeah, no, That's, and you lived it. Well, okay. This podcast is a brand risk. This is a brand risk waiting To have Jesus Christ, Christ have fun. You can edit, you can edit whatever. Fuck. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You tell us. You got me Thinking about everything I've said in The last 10 minutes. I'm like, Did we Fuck up yet? Nah. You support the stunt. Yeah. Nah, we, no. That is pretty, by the way, fuck you. I've watched, I watched your, I watch your stuff. Yeah, no, You get it. We are all I know You are. We're all, yeah, we're all everywhere with it, man. Nah, you know, dude, that's, but nah, I, I, I'm, I actually, yeah.


Nah, this show, this show is gonna be dope, man. I actually love this whole shit that we did. And it's owned by us. So it doesn't feel like anybody's telling us to do. Yeah. What they want us to do. Like, everything we have done, comedically has always been from me or my team. You know, our voice. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. So do you, like, is it true, because I've heard in those like shows you kind of ply the house with alcohol, gonna have like, a lot of alcohol. Like, how are you gonna keep people? Are you just gonna No. With us? Nah, we, we, we had some sponsors. Like we had Happy Dad. We had Taylor Port, but we didn't really like do it like that. 'cause I think naturally the girls are caddy, man. They, they naturally were just ready to fight. Yeah, sure. Just because the cameras aren't around. Yeah. A lot of the girls just were doing it just, we were like, yo, What the fuck Did you just fight her for?


And she's like, oh, the bitch was talking over me. No point. There's, there's no reason why you would just go and bat her in her face for no rea. So a lot of it, yeah, a lot of this shit was real. And it just didn't make sense. I think, you know, with women, they wanna be kind of like this new culture of like baddies or you remember bad Girls club. That whole shit is like a thing. So Yeah. They, with, with this show, you're gonna see a lot of that type of shit. Nice. For sure. Yeah. Yeah. That would be awesome, man. Yeah. What happened to the mayor? Done? Dude? I think he thought about the baddies. Yeah. He headed it back to his, Is this one of y'all's house? This is my house. Oh, this is your house? Yeah. Lamar used to live here. Who? He just moved out. The guy that just went back to his, The guy had coffee, Coffee, coffee laboratory.

And Laer just lifted it. Why did y'all clear the whole room up again? He made it his gaming room, and then lied to me about jacking off. He said he didn't jack off. I gave once. He said once, just once, dude, there's Like, when the cat pees in The basement, he's pee again. He cracked the seal on that room. No way. You were getting hard in there and walking back there. You did not walking outside. It was an amphibious mission. He'd probably swim across the Pool water.


I had no idea. You stayed here though, man. Yeah. I feel like all white comedians live here. I was just telling them that. Yeah. Tom se you Joe Rogan. Yeah. No taxes. What? What? Yeah. What is the reason? Taxes? Well, I think it's a couple different places. I have no taxes. The why here they don't have comedy clubs. Like, here, here you can do comedy every night of the week. Okay. Okay. Jersey, Tennessee and Florida. Florida? Yeah. Tennessee. Nashville could get it? Mm, they Could have it. Why open your own? You open your own too? I don't know.

But that seemed serious. Yeah. He seemed, yeah, because why? 'cause it didn't seem like anything he was joking about. No, there was no joking. None of the shit. He was tweeting Out unless he sells a fight with them. True. Because he just goes and gets knocked out by the Paul brothers. I was ready to ride against the Paul Brothers.

You can Just ride it out and eventually it spreads and spreads chill. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. You just give it to all your girlfriends In the head. Yeah. Okay. Well, I don't know about that.

CTE does. He's got a point kind of spread. No, He's got a point. Yeah. They got it from somebody who probably had CTE too.

The black players know. Yeah. Yeah, they do. Yeah. I was surprised. Yeah. Why though? They, they who A little Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I didn't think they'd get as hyped. I was like, I was going into it like, no one's gonna give a fuck. This is gonna be awkward. I walked in there. Ah, they like sick. Nah, they fuck with you man. Everybody do. Shannon Sharp used to do that where he'd be like, I can't believe all these white people know about me. It's like, dude, you have one of the biggest shows on YouTube. What you talking About? Yeah. His shit is jumping now.


Too huge after that Kat Williams situation. He's Yeah. I think he's like at 90 million for that one episode. Yeah. He got paid from just that one episode. Just that dude, the sex tape was kind of su though. That was like, yeah. I don't know if that was true. How do you go on Instagram live on Accident? Yeah. That doesn't, that doesn't happen. Then you Just promoted counter pills after at all. I don't, I I, I, I don't think I'm buying that either. I don't know. I don't know if that I actually happened for, for, I mean, feel, You know, more power to him. If it was like a violent One, I think he would've went longer. What do you mean? If it was intentional? I think he would've went longer. That was quick. I didn't, didn Could see how it ended either Though. It was Quick. Well, yeah. Two Minutes.


Yeah. But it could have been, He was going hard though. He could Think after He was going All right, he was growling. Good girl. Fucking intense. I think he had some good girls in There. It was intense. But See, that's the thing about it. If he was growling and doing all that, at some point you're about to bust if you're doing all that. Oh yeah. Because once you get in the mind, you're already there. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The sounds, see that's, people don't talk about that enough. The sounds will get you Fucking Yeah. A girl can girl makes one noise. I go, shut The fuck up. Yeah. Okay. I don't, It's true. That's true. It's true. I I told you not to make a fucking sound. I wear earplugs. I I I heard that shit. Guys wear 'em, they land planes. I put that.


It's a Mind thing, man. So I, that's why I Feel like with, with his shit, it's like, you know, Can you Do that again? What you Whatcha used to Say? Yeah. Fuck it. The second is like, it's like, shut the fuck up. Don't come, don't come, don't come. I'm right. There you go. Shit up. Oh, soon. Shut that bitch. Goddamn. Nah, I feel like, because immediately after he promoted like this, these sex pills. So I don't know if that could have been a promotional thing, you know, kind of promote like his Snoop dog said he was done smoking. Yeah. Yeah. It came out with the, the tireless grill or whatever. Yeah. Some of that, that company could have slid right in real quick though. I'm like, dude, promote us. You're everyone's talking about you grunting on that lady who Knows grunting.


You're right though. That shit was a quick hump. It was quick. Yeah. Yeah. But he could've been in the middle of humping and set it off mid. No, you had to scream. You gotta go through one, somebody screen recorded everything you have to do to go live on. That's what I'm saying. Instagram's what I'm, and it was so it was like seven different buttons you have to press. Maybe the girl did it. Maybe the girl did it on his phone. 'cause that's, yeah. There's no way he did that on accident. That's what I was saying originally. Because Once you get to the open, once you get to the open, the the fucking camera thing, which you slide over, you gotta keep swiping to get to the live. Yeah. And then once you get to the live, it asks you again, are you sure? Yeah. You want to go Live? It's not like, it's not a pocket dial.


You gotta like literally get there and agree to everything that is asking. So I don't, I don't know. I don't know. I it is, I'm glad he did It. Yeah. Yeah. Well, why would that be? It's just nice. Yeah. Yeah. I just like having it around. It's d and also I think about it a lot. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe when I'm having sex, I go, yeah, good lord. If somebody heard me, I listen to it to get hyped. I listen. If I like got a show, I listen to it just to hype myself up. You Put it the sex tape, Put the audio in. Just get hyped before, right before I go on stage. That Should be what you walk out to. Just play it for two minutes straight. Oh, that's A good girl. Yeah. Preston, that's a good girl. He threw it a couple good girls in there, which is like, All right. Yeah, he did Though.


That's what made it believable with me. I think once you start throwing shit like that in, it's like, oh, okay, good girls. This might be real Fucked up. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's weird. Yeah. Oh dude. Talking her through an orgasm, like, yeah. Good girl. That's what he doing. That's, I Feel like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ew bro. He's training Dude. That's More of a black thing though. Is It? What's good my nigga? That's my boy. So, Oh, I was hoping. Yeah, We're just in here grunt. We're here coming. Hell yeah, man. Dude. So this is what I, I was about to tell you guys to sober up the room. Apparently, you know, kin, remember Kinzie, the sex researcher back in the fifties, they made a movie about this guy back in the, what?


Back in like the fifties. This guy Took, how old are you man? I'm 38 for a second. I was like, am I 50 years old? Yeah. I'm like, what the fuck? So apparently in the fifties, this guy did like a crazy sex study where he like was interviewing housewives dudes. And he was like, was know what him talk about sex back then. And he was like, here's what's act what's actually occurring. And apparently I just learned this the other day, according to his stats, 37% of men had have had homosexual experiences defined by one of the men reaching orgasm back in the fifties. And that was self Who reported? That's a crazy stat. What? Okay, let, what made you fucking look this up? Man, My, my brother told me about it to be fair. Oh, you were jacking off?


No, I looked jacking Said my fucking brother. Right. You in the middle of a Good, my brother told me I had a, This guy was researching Facts. Yeah. You go research about how to come better. I mean, you definitely, he stopped jack off. Yeah. He stopped watching porn. Now you're jacking off the fucking research Jack, Jack off. Don't act like you wouldn't jack off to some research. I Wouldn't jerk off the research, the questionnaire research. Maybe the questionnaire. Maybe Questionnaire. If the questionnaire was charged enough, may it'd be a erotica. 37% of dudes were around In the fifties. Dude, I I, I could be wrong. My brother could be misleadingly. He could be, you know, leading you down. Like somebody came. Yes. Two dudes partied. One at least one dude came.


If not both. That's interesting. What does your brother do? He's chills. He's Chilling. Oh, He's not. He chills. He's Not even working. He's off the grid, bro. He's off The grid. He's off the grid. He's off the grid. Man. Well, I understand why He's doing research. I understand Why he's dun Research. He's in the dungeon, bro. Yeah. But yeah, no, he, he just hit me with the fact that I Said he's in the dungeon, man. He's cooking up. Yeah. Research on guys being gay in the fifties. Dude. I mean, is that a fucked Up fact? It's an insane, insane Statistic. It's true. Look, Google it. Dude. Please, please produce this Google. I wanna know if my Brother's leading. Yeah, my check his brother man. Dude. 30 in the fifties. Dude, that's crazy. And that's self-reporting. I mean this was, That's good. They included the jizz part because Exactly. Otherwise back then everybody would be like, I was kind of fucking gay.


I said goodnight to a guy when I was leaving a party. Yeah. 10. My brother's fluffing the numbers, bro. He's fluffing. 37 is crazy. Call your brother, man. I wanna talk. I wanna talk to this guy. I'm gonna fuck. I gotta get some clarification. Yeah. Call, call him. What's his name? Cal. Tom. Tom. Typical. I knew it was one of those three letter names. I'll put 'em All right now lemme see if he can clarify. I wanna talk to him. Oh shit. I don't know why I typed Thomas. Oh fuck Tom, let's go. Let's get the clarification. Is He older or the younger brother? He's my older brother. Oh, okay. Yeah. That's very weird. He's the oldest.


He's doing research. Second, second oldest. Oh. Oh, is Tom Fed's older than Tom? Yeah. I would've never guessed Fed k Fed's older than Tom. He, he's on FaceTime audio dude, he's on that. Oh, I mean that show his number. He'll call me back. But yeah, dude, fuck it. I could be wrong. But he was saying 37%, which is 10, including Women. Oh really? Yeah. Maybe this is an updated study. Maybe it's the Kinsey Institute of Research. But here's, here's my whole point. The reason I'm bringing this up, and this is the conclusion me and him reached independently. If it is somehow 37% self-reported, that means in real life it's gotta be what?


Like 90, 94. And the conclusion was we both reach this, this, these are, he's Got right there. Same numbers. We're just hold, hold On. There we go. My point is, I trust The Science with this. Me and my brother, were trying to say 10 To 94 fucking percent. 94 of guys, 37 say yes. It's definitely the amount who actually did it and didn't say yes. It's Gotta, we'll do a blind study. Everybody, I won't tell on you. Yeah, true. Everybody close your eyes. Raise your hand if you did something gay. Close your eyes. I didn't close my eyes Because I'm not fucking gay. Someone gets So I feel like if you participate and close your eyes, close your eyes. I feel like you're a part of it. If you close your eyes. So I'm not gonna close My fucking eyes. I'm not even gonna play half of The game with you.


My point was, me and my brother are arguing now, which one of us was the only, there's only, I know you did some cases. Yeah, he closed his eyes. You Closed your eyes. Yeah. But you said to close your Eyes. I did. But if you participated in anyway, that counts. You're part of the percentage. Fuck dude. I closed my eyes so hard. Yeah. The point was me and my brother were suspecting we might both be the only straight dude actually in the world. The chosen one, like the world's actually all gay and me or my brother are the chosen ones. I mean We are Neo, I, I might be out. I've been in, I've been in the room when dudes have jizz. That's Crazy. That doesn't count. It was straight. But that's What I'm saying. They're straight as hell. You guys were stoked on pussy.


Ah, okay. So it was, it was like a situation. Like It's a white guy trained. It Was white, it was a white guy trained. Come on, White dudes. He's a difference between a white guy train a black guy, White guy. Trains are teenagers jerking off together in the same room without a girl. Well That's weird. That's not, that's not a train at all. Usually It's a white train. Yeah. Just for the fuck of it. For the fun for shit and Giggles. It Just porn. You just get porn and you're just fucking stoking. You Know You don't need kids. Oh. Like just being there like it's the Moment kids, you know on point, you go to one guy at one kid's house who has a perverted dad. You go bro, break out the stash. The boys need to party. This is before the cell phones and shit. Back in the day it was only a VHS.


But Why together though? What is The reason your Team has to sit? What the fuck type of white shit is this back then? But Why together? What is? Because you didn't know the next time you were gonna see porn because it wasn't on the phone. There's no phones and it was just on. Yeah. You're just like, fuck, I'm gonna jerk off real quick. Yeah, yeah. You guys go over there. I'll go in this side room. Don't look. Yeah, But there's no walls. It's just Look, look you. That's a fair point. Pun in the, I mean we All Like, no, you can't look dude. Okay. Yeah. I mean I get it. That's So What's up with the walk us through the train? What's up With the, the train of the train? 'cause the train is Weird. Nah, I train. Yeah, it's because that carries on way too. It, I've never indulged in no train. Okay. But I, you know, I think at parties and stuff, there was a thing, you know, where when you're in high school, everybody's going in, you know, the girl's twerking in the, in the room here.


And then you might go upstairs and there might be five guys and one girl. Yeah. From the fucking basketball team and she's like the basketball trainer or water girl or whatever. Yeah. Right. You never know. And I think, you know, that would be considered a training. The black culture for sure. Yeah. And that's also considered gay. Well, I, I mean it By me. I, I've never participated. I just, I've just been at a party and maybe, you know, in high school you might see, walk into a room. Oh, shit. Okay. You've seen the train station? Yeah. You walked by. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, yeah. Or, or you just hear about it at school. You go Back to school the next day and they'd be like, oh yeah, we run a train on so and so. Yeah. Yeah. You just never, you know, you never know. It, it, it depends on the situation. But yeah, that's the black Train, I think.


Well, it's the same idea though. It's like, let's just all get while we get, Were you at any of the Diddy parties or did you miss that? What The fucking, where did that come from? How did that of all of, all questions. And did You miss that Train? How did that go? That train Might have left the station, But you, that train took from the, there were that right there to get All right. That train took off from the station for sure. You were close. Yeah. Yeah. No, I, no, I wasn't at that train station. You left early. You left early. No, that Was, that was down the street from me. I wasn't There. No. Did you ever meet? Did yo, What the fuck, bro? I forgot you. Actually, I've seen pictures with you actually.


Yo, what's the look you gave? That's the look of somebody who's like, well, I got cold hard facts of like, I've seen you with The guy, you know? Nah. Damn. Never been to that train station though. No, No. Good for you. Yeah. That's good. Nobody has, apparently. Yeah, everyone hasn't been there. I was relieved to learn that nobody was at the party. I've been relieved. Turns out no one was there. Everybody I've asked says no, I was Not there. Well, everyone pushes the time back. Like, yeah, I always left at 2:00 AM at 3:00 AM Everyone busted their dicks out. Like, how Do You Know, was Denzel wasn't Denzel saying that? Yeah. Denzel was like, no, I got outta there. Nah, I think Denzel was there whispering like cool Bible quotes to people. Be like, the devil gets close to you when they're most successful.


That would fuck you Up. And they're both getting their dicks. Getting their dicks up. Yeah. He said that about the, I think it was the Will Smith Chris Rock situation. Yeah, exactly. I Don't think that was Diddy's house. He said that up. No, Probably not. But what The, what do you think about the fuck, man? This dude be having hard, cold, hard facts, but mixes up the stories. I'm a Storyteller. Denzel. Denzel. Yeah. That would fuck you up. You're on ecstasy at a Diddy party. Fuck Denzel. Washington comes up and whispers training days. You training days, you shit. These guys are Sick, man. Seriously, The Diddy party. Who was there? At least one guy who Was at the Diddy party? Yo guys, guys, what the fuck man? Just tell us.
