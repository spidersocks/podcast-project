Lucky to be living on elk.

1:
I can't, I can't wait until she comes here. I'm going to the tour.

Katy Perry's. That was a good, I was expecting that to be terrible. The music video was great. Could do yourself a favor and watch Katie Perry's World. Its world's world music video.

1:
I, I thought the one part was really powerful. There was

2:
One part that was extremely powerful, and me and the crew ran it back and started chanting Wha man. Wha man. Yes. It is a women's world.

1:
Very, it was very powerful. Just that shot in general.

2:
She's trying to tap into the drags.

1:
Yeah. You're talking about just by smash

2:
Smashing, not that, just making that song.

1:

2:
A good market. Really. A song. She also was a host on RuPaul's Drag Race.

1:
Oh, I've seen,

2:
Trust me, daddy. I know all about the drags. Now, every once in a while, when it's a woman's TV choice, I have to watch fucking Yeah. RuPaul Drag Race. You

1:
Should remake Grease. That'd be a good movie. Remake Grease. But it's really all just drag queens and doing drag racing. But instead of the cars, they're just like walking towards each other and being like,

2:
One of the drag queens on the last season was a bit of a greaser. Really? You're not far off, man. You've got a, you've got a keen eye for the drag.

1:
Actually,

2:
The La Mer would obviously be the most powerful drag here. I would be number two. It's, it is about size and girth. I'd be a mean fucking queen dude. I'd be, yeah. You,

1:
You think, think the mayor would take the throne as the number one queen.

2:
If you watch the show, you'll see who they like. They like a, a portley fellow that does that. I'd be a giant though, because they wear like giant. Yeah. I'd be six, seven.

1:
Oh God. How big, how big of a bitch do you think you could be?

2:
I can be a, you know, I can be a bitch. You've seen me be a little nasty bitch. You've been, you've been around people when I was being a little nasty bitch to them. You go, God damn, that guy's being a nasty. I could probably be one of the nastier bitches.

1:
That's so, it's so funny.

2:
I know. Deep down I'd be a nasty queen. Dude. I gotta get my flexibility up though. They, I gotta True. That must be, I gotta work

1:
On that sick though. Just being a girl and being mad and just being like, I have no repercussions. I'm just gonna say the most off the wall shit right now. Oh yeah. It's gotta feel so

2:
Good. And I'm whole, forgive me in a day. All I have to do is say sorry. Once

1:
I know.

2:
In fact, I don't even have to say sorry. I have to just be kind of nice the next day. I

1:
Know. I have to vaguely acknowledge

2:
It. And the guy that I'm dating or married to will just go, eh, yeah. Fuck it. That's fine. Yeah. I don't give a shit. I know you're fucking dumb. No, that wasn't directed at anyone. That was

1:
A joke. No, it's just, it is funny though, just to like, be brewing. Wake up and be like,

2:
Dude, ever since I got my gun, I've just been so sassy. Really? Ever since the gun's been in the house, I've just been going. Who wants it? Yeah. What's up?

1:
What's going on?

2:
Any bump in the night? Last night? Yeah. Clip. Clip was loaded. Yeah. You

2:
The, the cops will get called.

1:
I'm not gonna hit

2:
Her. No, I know. But if you said,

1:
Not even say no at all.

2:
If you talk the way they talk to us, the police would be there.

1:
I'd be su true. I'll be way more subtle though. It'll be like, what's the matter? And I'll be like, no, I'll be like that all day. Mm. Just wake up and it's like, like my arm's hot. Like what? Like arms. I didn't get good sleep.

Have a different, oh, you, I have a different target. A d different target in mine. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. You would target to strike. You might hit some civilians though. I think the kids, the kids might be some collateral damage on that one. You do a targeted strike in response to pure terrorism.

1:
I'm getting a coffee and I'm like, there's too much syrup in here. Yeah. I got this coffee today and I was laughing. I, I want to start going to coffee, like the same coffee shop every day, getting the same thing. And every, like, as I sip it, walking out the door, I'm gonna go, ah, it tastes like shit.

2:
I'm just saying, the beginning of this has all been like, fucking women are fucking annoying. I

1:
Like, we're on can berry side. Whatcha

2:
Talking about we're having fun. We supported them.

1:
We do, dude, we're lucky to be living in those world. One

2:

1:
And it tipped over. Yeah. Dang.

2:
Damn. They probably got pretty hurt.

Oh yeah.

2:
I saw the skybar. Did you ever see those things? They put like a bar on a crane.

2:
Yeah. Really? Just high in the air. No, I saw one of the cables snapped on one of those and it like,

1:
Oh, they didn't, it turned into the fucking fun house, dude. It turned

2:
Into a real fun house.

1:
Damn

2:
Sleep. That seemed like the scariest thing I've ever seen. I think it was in Puerto Rico. I could be wrong. I thought it was okay. Maybe it wasn't. Dang the difference.

1:
It your father, father died. Puerto Rican Sky bar. Damn. I didn't know they'd do that. They just lift you up in a dude. When you're up that high too, the wind catches you and you're swaying like that seems like shit. That's a terrible idea. Yeah. Ibotta, nothing

2:
To do. Gonna piss the entire time. True that they're drinking.

1:

2:
Piss.

1:
Hey, now, now actually you could sell me on going up by

2:
Piss everybody

1:
Having Puerto Rican ladies pee on me and fucking, Hey, 900

2:
Feet. You gotta start selling tickets to the underneath. A little side hustle.

1:

1:
That it's business. True. That's the woman's world I dream of. Dude,

2:
Just get a poncho. Like you're the lady of the mist.

1:
I would be voguing up there, dude. If I was at fucking Puerto Rican sky pee bar.

2:
Yeah. Well you look up this Puerto Rican sky pee bar. We gotta fact check this. True. Sorry. We have an all black crew today. And

1:
They're, they're both,

2:
They're both preoccupied with the NBA

1:
Playoffs checking

2:
Stats. Dude, the NBA playoffs need to chill on the commercials.

1:
What's go, what are they doing bro? They,

2:
They are targeting the African American community with intensity.

1:
Wait, how so? Before I,

2:
Every single commercial is catered to black people. Gotcha. You gotcha. But it's like, almost like it's

1:
Not race war stuff.

2:
No, it's not race war stuff. But it's a little like wingstops taking up a bunch of

1:
Space. Yeah. It's you s a lot of wingstops. It's like it's every place. I mean, you're

2:
Watching it going

1:
Chill. The NB a's like spread it out dude. Shame on them.

1:
Tossing to Pep Boys. That shame on them.

2:
Yeah. It's fucking, literally it's Sprite. Yeah.

1:
Yeah.

4:
Somebody was saying the other day, they're like a, it's crazy that the Wingstop commercial isn't racist 'cause it's just a black guy.

2:
Wingstop commercials the most racist commercial I've ever seen. Racist is hell. He's a cool black guy. Just you describe it. He could, I can't even describe the wind stop commercial. It's a trap without sounding racist. It's a

4:
Trap. He's trying to pull out a janga piece and then they put a piece of chicken in his face and he is like, whoa. And his eyes knock over the Jenga.

2:
Oh, that's the other one. That's the no

1:
Flex. So

2:
Yeah. That's a good one though. I'm talking, there's a new wing stop commercial where it's basic. I think it's supposed to be an NBA player. And he's, he's doing the whole fashion fucking walkthrough that they do. And then he hops in a limo and just crushes chicken. There you go. And every white guy on earth goes, I knew that's what they're doing. I knew that's what was going on in those cool limos.

1:
It's so fucking funny.

5:
In case you still wanted to know it was Puerto Rico. It was, it was one of the bars. They said it this a thing snapped and

2:
All of the bartenders just started screaming all

5:
At once

2:
And they just, yeah. No shit. Yeah,

5:
It is. It's like

2:
That thing, they're not like pilots and they're not gonna be like, oh, okay. We got, yeah, we've got a cow cable. Yeah. Started, started

5:
Screaming and praying.

2:
Yeah, dude. Oh yeah. They're Puerto Rican sky bartenders. Dude.

3:
Surprised

2:
They weren't screaming and praying from the start.

1:
That's a major I rumba, dude, if you, if if one cable snaps in my Puerto Rican sky bar,

2:
I'm fucking,

1:
That's when my accent comes out. Honestly. That's really

2:
Holy fucking shit. No, no, no, no, no, no.

1:
God damn. I didn't know they did that. That's awesome. Cause you could spin that thing around too. You

2:
Can do whatever you want. You gotta get all that tower terrors.

3:
Tower terror.

1:
I believe it's important to take care of mental health issues because,

2:
Oh yeah.

1:
Well you gotta be careful, man. You know, you can't, you gotta get your mental health check. You gotta get your mental health check, otherwise you can really take you off, man. Next thing you know, you're wearing a fucking, a cool necklace. You think everyone's gonna like, and then everyone's fucking mad at you. And it's true. Turns out you should just went to a therapist instead of,

2:
You should have went to a therapist and said, would it be cool if I got a dragon medallion?

3:
Yeah.

2:
And there we go. Absolutely not.

3:
Absolutely not.

2:
They would say, are you the man? You'd go, ah, I

1:
Don't think. Yeah, actually we have a camp. I think your dad's been trying to sign you up for and Yeah, we're straighten you out. We're

2:
Gonna pray.

1:
Yeah. And I mean we used to think that dragon medallions were cool and then we went to therapy and the therapist actually therapy, he beat me. The therapist beat it out. Me.

2:
That's why we don't go to that therapist anymore. True.

There was a guy running for like local office. I don't forget where I was, but it was like, keep the balls outta girls' sports once and for all. Hire me to city council. I was like, fuck, I'll be tight if he gets elected. And it's like, All right dude, wake, let's go. I'll get rid of the

2:
Balls.

1:
She's like, I'm hitting the locker room right now.

2:
Turns out there was one in a neighboring district. Yeah. So that problem was already solved here. Time for me to focus on infrastructure. I wasn't ready for that. I was more of the balls guy. So I'm a little in over my head on this one.

1:
I ran on children's genitals and I,

2:
I ran on a campaign of entirely children's genitals. Turns out it wasn't as prevalent as I thought. Pretty much everyone in this district agrees. You

1:
Gotta set up a false flag. Yeah. You have your 13-year-old son. You're like, look, it's for the good of the community. It's for the,

2:
It's for the fucking dynasty. It's for the family s the City Council Dynasty. We could be the National Next Bushes.

1:
Yeah, that's a, that's a while. I mean, he probably got elected. I, where the fuck was I? I don't remember. Oh, you know what I think it was in, no, it wasn't in, it was in Alabama when we were down there. We were driving. I

2:

1:
It's not oozing Precum. But they have like a different drug guy. You know, Kensington has like the bend over guys in San Francisco. There's like these guys and they just walk around either. It's crazy. It's

2:
A new guy's stock walking.

1:
Because it was wi and they weren't like, if they were older guys. Oh my God. It was just like scoliosis untreated. They were like on the younger side, like in their thirties. Just hunched and then twisted too

2:
Nice. I wanna get a poke deck. Low pad level. They're trade fucking,

2:
We

1:
If mild aggressiveness,

2:
If America declines enough and we bring back basically the coliseum, we need to toss these boys in.

1:
True.

2:
I got a feeling the heroin boys in northeast are gonna be tough. I think the, the screaming runners here are all talk. You do. I think the heroin boys are gonna be tough.

1:
Yeah. And then for like the card, like the round girls, we can just get like street prostitutes.

2:

1:
They'd be technicians for sure.

2:
Yeah. Yeah. They'd be, yeah. They'd be working on the crafts because we would've, to get into po racing, we would've to let these boys operate some motor vehicles.

1:
We need the weight class. We need like the 95 pound to like 97, 95

2:
Pound. 1 10, 1 15

2:
There would be a lot of ana man. Keep the balls out of homeless. Cockfighting. The cocks out of homeless Cockfighting. Who, who's your pick to win the screaming runners on paper? They could be a paper tiger. Yeah,

5:
Untucked them. It made it a little

2:
More free.

1:
Allegedly

2:
Murdered a No, he did. He definitely did. He stabbed a kid in the heart in front front of everyone. And the kid died in his brother's arms. Yeah. And people are more offended that the lady who said a word has a go on me. But

2:
One crime is more severe than the other. Saying a word or stabbing someone in their heart.

1:
Yeah. I mean I could see you thinking that.

2:
That's where I get a, that's my, that's my little hangup on this. I know is one person talked. Yeah. And the other person stabs someone in the heart. The

1:
Craziest part, I don't know how people even researched it. The guy videoing the lady is apparently a pedophile. Of course he's a fucking ped. A legend. I don't know if this is true. Why the pedophiles

2:
Keep filming people.

6:
They keep getting

1:
Involved with this. They're like, he's a pedophile. I don't know how they even, you can't even see the guy's face and like, he's a pedophile. And then the, they

2:
Might be tossing these pedophile charges out willy-nilly. 'cause you can literally lay on a ground at a protest and shoot a guy and chances are he is gonna be a pedophile. Chances are everyone's gonna go. No, you knew. It's like fish in a barrel.

1:
I, I watched a clip of, I think, I think it was on the Sean Ryan podcast. He had a guy on who like does busts pedophiles. And he's like, dude, it is so much more prevalent than you think. Mm. Child porn specifically. He goes, dude, you should, I don't, we'll get age restricted, but you know, stuff. I don't care. Yeah. Whatever. But the, yeah, he goes, dude, the amount of like, the sheer volume we're tracking of people accessing it is super high. And according to him, he was like, and it's, it's high in like 20 year olds. So he's like, you get a lot of, you get a lot of younger dudes hitting the fucking cp.

1:
Yeah, that's, I saw a cool priest in San Francisco. I went down to Haight Ashbury or whatever it's called. Yeah. Like the big hippie area. And there was a cool priest in Doc Martins walking around. Like there was like the, like laying on the ground hippies on like the corner. And he was like chopping it up with them. They were fighting. They, they literally, we were there for maybe an hour just walking around and like within that hour they all spazzed and freaked out at each other. He's not fucking cool man. You fucking damn man. They started freaking out on each other. I was like, dang it. This is what hippies always do. They always spazz on each other. They were like jamming on acoustic guitars. It was sick.

2:
And then I've been big into hippies lately. Really? I've been watching a lot of Vietnam.

1:
Oh yeah, yeah,

2:
Yeah. I'm back. I'm reading a Vietnam book, watching Vietnam documentaries. That's tight. You know what pisses me off about Vietnam documentaries? What they always cover. They always, Ken Burns did it. Now this Netflix one does it where they interview North, north Vietnamese like civilians that, and they always cover American atrocities. I've never seen one where they focus on what the fucking Vietcong or doing to people. Yeah.

1:
What do they do? What did they torture?

2:
Shit. Horrific shit. Yeah. They're kidnapped and murdered. Like everyone dang priests. They were butt fucking priests. Oh

1:
Yeah. Was that's a, I think Titch not hung or that guy who wrote all those books, he, he like escaped from there. He said it was like pretty bad.

2:
Yeah. Dang. Yeah, it was bad. Yeah. They, I mean the only thing they ever really covered is like John McCain and this one pilot, I think his name was Alvarez. He got shot down like day one and stayed in prison the entire fucking war. Damn. Yeah. It's a tough time.

1:
Yeah, I do. From what I've heard, they didn't treat the prisoners well.

2:
Day one you go, how long is this war gonna be like, man, it should be a couple days. It's a decade isn't it? It's, it's gonna be a decade he made.

1:
He did he he made it out of there. Yeah. Holy shit.

2:
Yeah. He's a freak bull.

1:
Yeah. 10 years. He's

2:
A freak bull.

1:
10 years. Not even like a shitty hostel either. You're in Yeah. Vietnamese, I, I could

2:
Be wrong. He, he might be the one, one of the bros getting interviewed. 'cause they, they always do they, the Vietnamese, the North Vietnamese would film the prisoners to be like, tell 'em we're treating you good. That's so funny. And the one guy did fucking morse code with his eyes to be like, they're torturing us. It was pretty sad. Oh

1:
Dang. Yeah. And they didn't even notice he was doing it. No shit. What a genius too.

2:
Yeah. That's crazy. Yeah. Be like, fuck up. I fucked him.

1:
It'd be funny if you just did like, I'm doing nothing but a lot of gay stuff here. But then you're like, ah, I fucked up. I

2:
Got that thing way wrong.

1:
He's doing a lot of gay stuff. Yeah. That, that would suck. Especially if you're there for 10 years. Like, I mean, you know, you're like, unless you're doing like a legendary Sr, you're going to one point break And you start, you're like cranking 'em out in like an underground Vietnamese bunker.

2:
Yeah. You're cranking 'em out.

1:
Cranking 'em out would be crazy. Getting caught too.

2:
Come in here.

1:
You

2:
You guys gonna rip my fucking fingernails off again? I'm trying to jack off.

1:
You're

2:
Looking at underground. I told you everything. I was here day one. I don't know what's happening. I got no more information. I have no idea what year it is. I got nothing to tell you.

2:
Yeah. Probably kept that one to himself for a while. Yeah,

1:
True.

2:
Were you in Vietnam? No.

1:
Yeah. Oregon's be like, not really. Sort

2:
Of. I kind of, yeah.

You were in New York, I like got, I had like almost ran outta gas. Lamar were you with me that one time in the car? I think it might have been Guardini. We got stuck in Newark, York and I almost ran outta gas and we, I was like, I was like, there's gotta be a gas station. My GPS took me to a fake one and I ended up at like deep in a refinery. Like I couldn't get out. It was, oh, it was terrible. But you can't find people in those places. It was just industrial. Terrible. I was so scared.

2:
You were spooked.

1:
Yeah. 'cause I was like, if I, the refineries

2:

2:
Weird. Me and Nate were talking about, 'cause we were arguing about the not arguing again having a nice, having a nice racial discussion about the algorithm. But it's like, dude, if, if something happens like India, Pakistan, let's say somehow that pops off and the world goes to war. Yeah. Americans, we, we've, you know how like we've spent the last definitely last like 15 years really trying to suppress like the racism and hatred in this country. Obviously fueling it, but Yeah. Like making a real concerted effort from it. Dude, the second we flip that switch to World War iii, it's gonna be like, let it fly dude. Let the hatred.

1:
'cause then the floodgates will break and they'll just be like racist caricatures of like black people for no reason. Hey, what the hell? Hey,

2:
Hold on a second. I

1:
Just got 'em ready.

2:
Shut the case. Shut the fuck up in World War iii. Dude. We don't have time for this fucking bullshit.

1:
Yeah. That's gonna be, if we get like a, 'cause the last time we got like a national hate vibe going was nine 11. Nine 11. Yeah. It was on now

2:
That and that was not even on. Yeah. Think if it was really on true. Like think if there was an actual enemy. Oh

1:
Living in the future. Just be like, what the fuck?

2:
Yeah.

1:
I just, I just read a nice book this weekend on the plane. I, I found it in a bookstore. Just, it was just like a lady who, I guess like in the seventies, something fucked up happened in Korea, in South Korea where a guy just declared himself lifelong president. He just smashed

2:
Where, where

1:
Was it? Korea, I think it was south or maybe it was like right before the war that divided South and North Korea. Was that in the seventies I think? Or? No, that was

2:
Fifties.

1:
The Korean War. Yeah. So the Korean War split it in half and I think in like the next 20 years there was a little bit of obviously some tumult. Yeah. And, and this guy was just like, I'm the president forever. And it just set off this like horrible wave of violence and poverty. And then the lady got adopted to an American family and just like got out of there and like they, the Korean government allowed parents to just be like, yo, if your kid's like too much, just we're shipping a bunch of kids to America. So I think that was like a huge wave of a Yeah, they were just like, And you would just, they would declare you as an orphan. Your parents would be like, such

2:
A good Korean adopted kids. They rock.

1:
Yep. And no, there was nothing like your paperwork. You would hit America and like, you would have blank birth certificate that, that you had no, you couldn't find your parents ever. And this lady just wrote like a, it was like a book of like, kind of like poetry and essays, just about like getting beach in America. It wasn't even really about that. She was just writing about like the Big bang. It was pretty sick actually. She

2:
Was just writing about The Big Bang. About

1:
The Big

2:
Bang. Was that her fucking dad's name? Big bang. That's little bang. The dumb racist jokes is a good dad. Racist joke. Big bang. It's so funny. We're firing today, dude. This always feels like a Patreon.

1:
The temperature is cooking. All

2:
This thing. Yeah. I'm heating up a little.

3:
Feels like a

2:
Big bang. Was too good to pull back on. Pull up. Pull up terrain. Terrain. Straight for the mountains.

1:
Hot dig. Itty.

2:
Darn. No guys are allowed to have fun. Dude. Dude. You

1:
Know, I actually, I, dude, I did the mothership last night, had a good time, but afterwards I got off and just smoked like a giant joint in the green room and then went home. Like I'll pass out. Fucking no dice

2:
At all. I'm wide awake.

1:
Yeah, I, I was just laying there. I had, dude, I, I don't know, I had this idea where like, I want to come up with a, a company or some sort of technology that, like, you, you, you could send your dad a painting and the painting,

2:
I mean, already

1:
It comes rat

2:
Love to send my dad

1:
Famous. We'll get this so it comes like wrapped in cellophane. 'cause what happens is it has some sort of like technology when like, when like, like the moisture in the air hits it, it slowly transforms the photo. So your dad hangs it on the wall. Yes. He's so pumped on it. And like slowly little. It'll be like a general like standing like a battle scene. Yes. And then like the general day after day slowly transforms into a giant throbbing veiny dick that's just like, just laying waste or just like, or instead of a battle scene, it turns into just like guys having sex and your dad just walks into his house one day. He is like, what the damnit fuck.

2:
Yeah. The

1:
Technology's gotta exist.

2:
That reminds me of this. Send a pic. I haven't sent a picture of a hot guy's ass to my dad in a while. If you just Google guy's naked ass, I

1:
Remember this.

2:
Send it right to your dad. He is gonna love it. And you can put the invisible ink on it now. Oh, exactly. Yeah. They get very confused and

1:
It just slowly check day by day. They don't even notice it until one day. They're like, what the fuck.

2:
Yeah. Or you could get like a, almost like, you know how when you're looking at porn, there's like those Simpson. Yeah. Like family guy. You could do one of those with Nancy Pelosi. Fucking Donald Trump in the ass.

1:
Dude. That would be,

2:
It'd explode. That'd

1:
Be India versus Pakistan. Dude. They would, that'd be sp they would spazz. I mean, I'll tell about fucking done. Especially if your dad's like a mechanic. He's got like hanging up on his wall and he is like, you know, the Cali person. The guy's like, what the fuck is that? He like, God damnit

2:
Some fucking punk must have done that. God damnit fucking asshole punk. That's a great idea.

1:
Wouldn't that be fun? Well, I

2:
Mean that's aura frames

1:
Aura. You could, yeah. If you,

2:
You could stack the deck in

1:
Aura Frame

2:
You toss one in. Yeah,

1:
You could, that would be digitally would be the easiest. Like day by day, like by pixel of transforms that way you're like, nah, it's just like a cool photo, electronic photo. It was great. Or it's just, that would be nice if you could do this easily where it's like a nice picture of you and your dad. Then you do an AI slow-mo transfer where it's just you guys making out. My dad would be like,

2:
He might, yeah, my dad would. Yeah, he might

1:
Fall. My dad might fall over.

2:
Yeah, that'd be bad.

1:
If it was just one of those like gifts. Tony

2:
Soprano looking at the Uncle Ben's. Yeah, that's that's a great idea. That

1:
Was keeping me up last night. I'm like, that would be so funny. And then, and then I, I came up with an idea for immigration we could do where you could sponsor. So, 'cause it was like adults, it's a hard, it's hard for adults to get in this country, but I was thinking about that lady getting adopted and like that's the move. Like babies have the ultimate rights, like babies, boom. Instant citizenship. If you can adopt. So what I wanna do is set up an adoption program where you adopt like a child from like El Salvador. But then the deal is the child's whole family comes like whole extent. Like mom, dad, uncles, aunts, all the kids come. So as part of the deal is you can adopt the kid, But you can sponsor a whole El El Salvadorian family. But you have to have the means.

1:
But then it becomes like a vassal thing where they become your vassals and Cool. Hold on. Hear the whole idea out. So they come, you set them up, they have citizenship, they have total citizenship. It's more of a dentured ude. They have, they have citizenship. They can rock, they can do their thing. They're free citizens. But you tax.

2:
But they have to be the producers on this podcast, they have to sell mer after shows.

1:
But no, you get to tax them. So you grant citizenship, you pay what it is you grant you, you now you have like imagine that dude, you have like a Casita And you have your vassals. They're free to work, do their thing. They can build their own empire. And what the ultimate showdown is the adopted kid. As soon as he turns 18, if he outperforms your own bio kid, the whole empire goes to the El Salvadorian kingdom and your kid has to fight back. Then he becomes that vassal for the El Salvadorian family. If he out produces their offspring, it goes back and forth. It's like a kind of like a kingdom kind of tight.

2:
Yeah. I mean, I don't know what to tell you. There's a lot of holes. I dunno where to start with this one. That's

1:
Why I couldn't sleep last night.

2:
So

1:
I know it sounds rough.

2:
Slavery for a generation and then you switch. Not

1:
Slavery, they're dude, they're free market players. They're just getting taxed. They got they're your subjects. They're getting taxed.

2:
They're getting taxed subjects.

1:
But they are free market players. They just gotta

2:
Yeah, it's feudal. Feudalism. It's

1:
Feudalism. Yeah. Like modern, modern feudalism. But with the opportunity, they would light a fire under your kid's ass. You'd be like, bro, I

2:
Don't know. I feel like every kid would get crushed. Every futile kid would be like, eh. Yeah. To sell the marriage.

1:
Yeah, but they couldn't if they did that.

2:
Dad, Papa, they're not selling the marriage.

1:
They gave me nothing to talk about on my podcast, Papa. I don't know it, it's just an idea. It is a good idea. We don't have to do

2:
It. No. You know, we don't, we shouldn't. But it's not a bad plan.

1:
It's fair to be like, bro, I'm gonna foot the bill. You guys are total citizens, but I'm gonna tax you. You have to pay tax on tax. My tax for one generation, I'm gonna tax you. It's a pyramid scheme with immigration. Yeah.

2:
Wouldn't

1:
It be bad?

2:
That's how the pyramids were built. True.

1:
True. Yeah.

2:
True. Literally, you're reverting back to ancient ideas. I own this family.

1:
Yeah, you wouldn't own them. You would be sponsoring them and taxing them. You sponsor them. Fair

2:
Tax. I'm sure the what the guy said back then.

1:
No, hold

2:
On. It's not, you're making it sound worse than it is

1:
True. Oh,

2:
The house they live in a house I built. So

1:
You'd be excited for the wedding. You're like, oh, wedding. Huh? Let me go by and see what's going on here as the Lord isn't, no,

2:

8:
Short

4:
Circuit. He just said, I'm Guardini. He was like, I'm strong Guardini. And it worked.

2:
Oh. So no. Yeah. Short answer.

1:
Yeah. I short circuited. I had a line last night, I forget what it was, but I like, just botched it. Retreaded it, re botched it and then finally just waved the white flag and was like, guys, we're skipping that one. Yeah. Yeah. Completely
