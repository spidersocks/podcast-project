Live From, the headquarters of Ramsey Solutions. It's the Ramsey Show where we help people build wealth, do work that they love, and create actual amazing relationships. Dr John Delony, PhD in counseling. RAMSEY personality number one, bestselling author, And host of The Dr John. Delony Show on the Ramsey Network A. Lot of titles. There. He's my co-host. Open phones at Triple Eight. Eight two five five two two five. The Call is free. And, some say the advice is worth Exactly. What. You pay for It. Wayne starts this day. ET in Chicago, Hi Wayne, how are you? Hello? I'm doing great.


thank you. How about you? And? Dr. John. We are better than we deserve brother. How can We help? Thank you. Yeah. Honored to talk to y'all. We're long time listeners. I had my wife with me so she can hear me. So We are We. We are filling out for our paperwork, for our inheritance for our children. We're going through all That process. Right. Now we have three kids, two baby boys under two And. One daughter from my previous marriage. And. She is 24. And. we like how you push stipulations. And, we've heard you say before in your will, That, you have, they have to live certain way. And be A certain way we're God-fearing Christian.


So We wanna make Sure like my wife thinks one way. I think the other. So We need A. Tie breaker or We need some wisdom on this. So We wanna make Sure. She's ACO living according to the Bible. And doing the things That, we expect her to And. My wife says If, she's not There doing That yet. When we should pass, should we still give her the, or We shouldn't give her the inheritance. And. I'm like, well maybe We should give her A chance to Get. To There. And. Then she could Get have part of the inheritance. Or And. That would go for even our boys. So we're just like torn on how we should handle That. Yeah. Okay. W we you have the information correct.


you have the spirit wrong behind What. We did. Okay. Okay. What. We did was not A punishment thing. It was not A carrot or A stick thing. It was simply, we back up And. we told our kids from the time they were adults on That for Sharon and I, as for me, And my house. We serve the Lord. And. So we view our assets as God's. They're not ours. Our job is to manage his stuff, his way for him. So the kids have no rights. And, What we explained to them was If. They inherit something. All they're inheriting is the Right to manage it.


They don't become the owner anymore than I'm the owner. And. So this is, you know, And. So you wouldn't hire someone to manage A Burger King, who has proven to not follow the Burger King manual Right. Correct? Correct. Because the man That owns the Burger King would be pissed because he ends s up. You end up with A, with A A, McDonald's burger over There or something. Right And. So Right And And. It's his money. And him That. I'm concerned about And. They don't have any legal or spiritual or moral rights to or entitlement to our wealth.


ET. All And And, when they do inherit It, all they inherit is the weight of It. And not the privilege of it. You actually Get the privilege. but it, you view it properly. It's A responsibility rather than I hit the lotto. You follow me? And. So it's not like If, you don't behave. I'm gonna take It away from you. That. It's not got any of That in it. ET all. but it's got to be okay. The other thing That, I'll add to That is this, And, it's hard for me because ET times, especially with people, I love, I'm extremely loyal, is That If. Someone's misbehaving And. You give them money, you magnify their misbehavior. Absolutely.


An extreme situation is If. You've got A kid doing heroin, And, you leave 'em A million dollars, you're gonna kill 'em. 'cause they'll overdose. 'cause they've got unlimited resources to buy weed. And, heroin, Right, Oh. Yes. And. So you magnify their problem. You don't help it by throwing money on it. Whatever the problem is. So I don't know What, she What. Her behavior is That you're so concerned about or your wife's so concerned about. but let's back up And, just view this from A manager or A stewardship perspective. and I. That's the way I would talk to her about it. I would say, honey, I love you, And. You know, you and I can have A discussion about your behavior between Father And daughter. but it can also I need also need to tell you.


I can't in good conscience leave you managing God's stuff when you're not following God. I, I have to report. I have to report back to him. And. So I can't do That as A moral act on my part. And, that's different than I'm gonna hit you with A stick until you Get in line, you're outta the will, you're outta the will until you quit doing That stuff. Right. You know that's different spirit. Okay, you follow me? Yes, yes, that's correct. And And, If. You want If? This is Delony If If. You want to make Sure. There is never any complete rec reconciliation between you And your daughter, who sounds like she went through some sort of y'all divorce growing up.


Something like That Yeah. So pretty rough divorce. And, my ex kept her away from me for six years. So still kind of estranged, but she's taking steps to follow in God. So she calls me with advice. I Sure guide her. She, she, she got saved maybe A year ago. So I just wanna make Sure I. We do this correctly. And, we don't wanna stunt her in any Way. Well, here's, here's I. Want You, Tom. I'm telling the stepmother not to use the sister care in the stairs. There, you go. Okay. and I man, I know y'all are both on the phone here. So I'm gonna say this directly as I can. It's very common. That, when somebody gets remarried, That other kid from That other woman, That other kid from That, other man, they're not getting my stuff.


And. So the, the red flag for me in this Call was not living by the Bible. I. Want you guys to be real clear. You can go to 500 different churches. And, Get, 500 different interpretations. What does That actually mean when you sit down across the table from your daughter, And say, I'm worried about you. I love you. Here's how we can best love you, If. You keep, 'cause you're gonna, I'm proud of the steps you've made. That's Right your spiritual walk. you have still got A couple steps to take to Get back just, just to Get this side of the ditch that's Right. You're, you're outta the, you know, you're outta the ditch. but we wanna Get you over here up in the road again. And. I'm gonna walk with you. And love you. And. You know And And, you know If, you want to draw your will up one way or another, but it I hesitate to And.


Here's the other thing. When someone says, living by the Bible, I. I. When we say That, ET ramsey's, it's A A A. Very broad thing. It's not every nuanced little Oh. You ate A shrimp. Exactly. You, because It says in Leviticus not to eat shelled animals. Right, but Oh We don't have to follow the Old Testament. Now We gotta Get into orthodoxy. Oh. Did Christ cancel out That or did he fulfill it? And Oh. My goodness. Greg Yeah, we got A doctrinal argument here. Odd infinitum. I'm talking about the big stuff. Okay? Right, And, And, And. You've got some If. You're doing cocaine on the back of A yacht. You're probably not following the Bible. Okay? So you're out. Okay, but it, you went to A different church. That has musical instruments. And John's church doesn't correct. Then it's probably okay. That's exactly Right And And.


Here's the thing. If, you wanna drive A wedge between you And, your adult children try to control their adult behavior with the threat of, well then I'll just take you outta the wheel. They, it Won't work. You will lose. You will lose your children. Don't do That won't Work. Don't do That. I'll say even. Even though ours would be moved out, it's actually A an element of A trust. There is steps for the brother And. Sister That are remaining after Sharon and I are gone to walk. That person back in, that's Right as they straighten up their lives. Right. So this is not A, this constant. It's not A stick. It's not A stick. Yeah. We're constantly hitting somebody with our wealth, trying to Get them to behave. And. They're 37 years old.


And actually have A brain. No, that's not What we're doing. In her case, she's 24. but Yeah, it's not What we're doing So That. That's but you have to balance That juxtapose, That If. You will with this idea. That. It's not mine to start with And. I'm managing it for him. This is the Ramsey Show

Chloe is in Columbus, Ohio. Hi, Chloe Welcome to The. Ramsey, Show Hi. Dave Hi John. How are you today? Better than we deserve. What's s up Than? So my question is, is it okay for me to set financial boundary issues within my marriage? And If. So how should I do That What does That mean? So, okay, backstory. Several years ago, my husband unfortunately lost all of his finances due to someone else handling slash mishandling for them. Him mishandling his finances for him. So he initially had to start from square one. All his finances received.


Fast forward to now he's been trucking from trucking jobs to trucking jobs. And, there's always been some type of issue with the lack of mileage, the lack of pay, the hours truck breaking down all types of issues. So due to him being A, Hi income earner in the past, I think What he's doing is being extremely selective. And picky with What jobs, he'll take. So I'm basically trying to see how I can help him commit to just doing something like soccer, And, backroom, even entry, like something like That until he's able to do the thing That he wants to do, which is trucking. Just because it's been three years since he's had A, secure And, steady job, And. It's just put A, lot of financial stress on me.


So he's not making any money 'cause he is not working much. Yes. Why is he not working much? He's gone for jobs. Like, he'll go A Job. That wasn't What. I said, I said, why? What's broken? Why didn't he wanna work? He used to work. Yeah, nothing's broken. Hmm. His pride maybe. Hmm, His confidence. Maybe. Yeah, have you sat down with him? And said, I need you to I need I need you to help provide for this family. Yeah.


Yeah. Did you say it like That or did you talk about the jobs I need you to take different jobs? No, no, I've, I've said it. We've had several conversations about this. And. Then he'll try to go back into tracking goes he is like, Oh, this is, we'll make A lot of money. This will be more money. but I'm like, okay, it hasn't been working. So There, you go, even If, you have had A job. That's only $15 an hour. Like, that's better than just sitting And waiting, And hoping for something else to What. Is he doing during the day? Is he just sitting ET home? No, he does side hustles. Like he does car audio or he bakes sometimes he has some family friends. That. He does like side work for, but it's nothing like substantial to help cover all of our expenses.


Neither is $15. Yeah. Hmm. You don't like who he's running with. I don't like who he's running with Yeah when he goes over There. And works with the guy on the stereo thing. You don't like it, do you? No, I'm fine with It. It. Indifferent. If. It was actual consistent. Full-time income. Yeah, Yeah, I, I. Don't think this is about financial boundary issues. I think this is about the fact. That, you don't respect your husband. And. He's doing nothing to earn That. Respect And. That's different than love. And. That's different than honor, And. All those other words.


but The financial boundary issues you're talking about setting are What. You do Right before you file divorce. 'cause you gave up on him. That's Right Because you're talking about splitting the bills because you're tired of of, of carrying the whole weight of this household. Right As as If. You running the whole thing by Yourself's gonna fix It. It doesn't. Are you done Right? You sound, you sound done. No, no. I'm just frustrated. Yeah, It. It's hard when you sit down And tell somebody, That, you love I. Need some help. I need you to be A full participant in this marriage. And, he looks ET you, And goes, nah, that's heartbreaking, isn't it?


Yeah, Yeah. I'm sorry. And. And, And. You deserve better than That. Whatever that's worth. I'm so sick of guys who are scheming. And always have A plan. And always have A thing. And always have A thing. And, their wives are just drowning. I'm sorry, It sounds like That. You need to sit with A counselor or your pastor. Both And. Bring him If. He'll go And. He needs to hear loud And. Clear That. Your marriage is going down the drain. It's not gone down the drain yet, but the water's running out of the sink Because If, he doesn't And If, he doesn't go Get.


Full-time. Employment as A sign. That. He loves his family. Then it, it's, you know, this is gonna be, this is gonna continue to Get worse. It's not gonna Get better. And. There's no boundary That you can set. Like, I'm not gonna give you anything but lunch money. Like he's four freaking years old or something. He's not your son. He is your husband. And. So cutting him off from, you know, whatever. That's not, that's not gonna That doesn't fix this. What fix is this, is he, his heart changes And. He goes, Oh, I gotta Get up off the couch. And fixing his two stereos. A week's not gonna cut it. And. So I'm gonna have to go leave the cave, kill something And, drag it home.


And, Yeah, That. That's I mean. You're gonna have to set A, not A financial boundary, but A marriage boundary. ET, some point Yeah And. That's you do That. Not with two talk radio guys. Okay. Or podcast guys or YouTube GOs. You do That with A counselor. That gets into Y all's life. And. They go through your underwear drawer And. They know what's really going on. And not A. Three minute discussion with me. Yeah or John? And. We would never tell you unless you're being abused to end something on the radio or on s podcast. but we will tell you That, you're heading That way maybe more than you realize. Chloe Yeah, I. Think that's the thing.


And, it's I. Feel like there's, you're in the dark. And Dave and I are looking ET the flashing red lights. Yeah, it's your marriage is in A. Lot of trouble. and I think it's, it's about gonna see somebody. ET A. S A p Yeah I hate That for you, Dave. My, my It seems to have cropped up over the last two years. and I would say it's, it's, it's just flat out ignorance on my part. Just the men I run with even the goofballs. I run with Right. None of them would look ET. Their wives. And say I ain't doing That. I just don't know those men. but it seems to have cropped up. More And, more And, more And, more I. Think they're males. Oh, I like That, Yeah, I don't think they're men.


Like There's A responsibility you got man, when you, when you, when you take somebody's hand, And, you say I do till death was part you have opted in. You don't have the obligation to wait for the cool new deal. You gotta go Get it done for your family. Period. End story And. You can self-actualize later. That's A later problem. Right, This is the Ramsey Show.

Chris is in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Hi Chris Welcome to The. Ramsey, Show, Hi. Dave Hi, John. How Can We help? So we lost my father-in-Law about April of last year. Oh, sorry. and I didn't think I What going. Get emotional about it. but it's been A long. Kind of just struggling year with my mother-in-law trying to Get her together. And, it's just And. Keep my wife together. She's an only child. And. So it just kind of fell onto us or me. And. I'm just my father-in-law left her set up pretty good.


but you know, A, couple million dollars in assets, And in investments, And. Then you know A, few hundred thousand dollars in assets. And, I'm Sorry, A. Couple million in assets or A. Few hundred thousand in assets. I got lost. A. Couple million in like in like investments. And stuff. And IRAs, And four. Oh one Ks, And. How old is she? And then? She's 65. Okay. Alright. I got You. So And, he, they were already collecting Social security And. They were in A pretty good spot before he passed away. and I don't know I just, he was trying to keep this stuff growing.


M And, ET this point I just I don't, it hasn't stopped. I'm still checking in on it forward from time to time. And, it's going through one of the big investment companies. but What are worried about brother. How can we help? Well it's not even I. I just don't know how to reassure her. That. She is fine. And taking care of And. How to keep her from just driving it off the cliff. Really? I mean. How long were they married? She's 44. It would've been 44 years. They were just like A month shot. What. You think she What going drive it off the cliff.


Dad kind of did everything. So not, not, not bad habits or bad character. Just lack of knowledge. Yes. Okay. Alright. Good. Yeah. Yeah. No I mean that's really What. It is. Dad did everything. Yeah. Dad made Sure. Okay, I don't want you to take the place of dad. Yeah. This woman is 60. This woman is 65 years old. It's time for her to grow up Yeah. That's harsh. but she should have grown up before he died. Right, My wife knows What. My stuff is, our stuff is And. She knows exactly What to do And. She's not some clueless babe in the woods. When I die, she's gonna have A clue.


That's part of our estate plan is her knowing What to do when I die. Right And. So now What we've gotta do is play catch up in That area. He did A, great job providing the n egg. He did A, lousy job involving her And, letting her have A level of competence. And confidence. So We got A. Little catching up to do. Now the does the big firm That, it's with have an advisor, That, you all are talking to or is this some internet crap? No, no, no. It was Yeah. It's it. We have an advisor. We does the advisor have the heart of A teacher or is he or she? A don't snot I don't. No, she actually, she's been, she's dealt with her with I.


Think kind of kid gloves. Okay. I want her to teach her. I want her to sit down. And Show her What. These investments are how they work. And. Why With $2 million, she's more than okay Right. I want the advisor to teach her That. If. She can't or won't. Get A new advisor. Okay. Because her the advisor's job is not to handle this for her. Your job is not to handle this for her. Your job, her job is to make Sure That. This lady gets peace ET night when she lays her head on the pillow because she understands That. She's okay because she understands her investments not 'cause her son-in-law said so Right, There's no peace.


And, Dave, Ramsey said. So there's no peace. And, Chris said. So pieces says I know What, the flip's going on. I Get, this I got $2 million. That should generate 200,000 A year in income. I'm okay. Right. Well And like this year, I looked ET it. Her projected forecast is like 60,000 And. She's sitting on probably close to 200 just sitting liquid in the bank. Right Now Yeah, she's fine. Right now she's fine. She's okay. Nothing to worry about here. but she does need to Get. The advisor's job is not kid gloves, it's to be kind compassionate. She lost her husband in April of 44 years. Right, I'm not driving past That. Not being harsh Right. but it am saying the advisor's job is, is not to continue.


This person's in abil your mother-in-law's inability to know what's going on. She needs to know what's going on for her sake. She'll feel better when she knows what's going on. Right. It's like someone gave her the keys to the car. And put her behind the seat. And said drive And. She doesn't know. What she's doing scares you to death. Yeah and I mean it kind of scares us to Get to death too. Because like I said, we're up here in Pennsylvania. And, she's down in Texas. And Yeah. Is she willing? Is she willing to relocate or is That just, where is That home? That where her friends And family. And. Rest of her family is I. It's it's home. Okay. I mean she says yes, but it don't. Okay know You have got kids. Yeah. I have A daughter.


Okay. Okay, that's A draw card. Yeah, Yeah, Right, Right, And. Here's something so A. Lot of times people Get stuck And. It's hard to metabolize A loss. Like Right. She lost A lung, she lost A part of her heart. She lost an arm. And A leg like she lost A part of herself. Right Right. That's half A century A cool gift you can give her And. This is gonna sound weird, but next time y'all are together over the holidays or having A cup of coffee or even A phone. Call I would love for you to say I would love for you. Mother-In-law. If, we could have A. Couple of conversations. The way your husband left you is inspirational to me and I want to take care of my D of of your daughter, my wife, the way you were taking care of.


Will you tell me some of the things he did? Will you tell me about him? Some stories I Don't know And. Here's What. You're gonna give her And. You. Y'all are both gonna Get the gift of metabolizing this loss by telling stories. Yeah And in those stories are the lessons. And. As she talks about It, it will slowly move to past tense. And It will slowly lose. Move to exhale. I'm okay. Right. I can learn how this money works. but Some of this is, some of this I can see is fear. Of course it is because He did. He did so much for her. That's Right And. Every day she wakes s up A. Lot Of it. She blames on the way she was raised. Well That, she gotta move past That. When you're 65, That one doesn't work.


Yeah Yeah we're past. That Works when you're 25. That's Right. Yeah. Call. Her And say, Hey, I wanna learn. I wanna learn about him. 'cause I wanna take care of of your daughter the same way he took care of you. Right. You tell me some stories. Yeah And stay with That advisor. If. They've got the heart of A. Teacher If. They don't move. It And to Get. Somebody That says, honey, this is how it works. You're fine. Now tell me back how It works. This how It works. You're fine. Now tell me back how it works. Sometimes you have to explain it like five times when you're A teacher. Like I've been doing That for 30 years here on the radio. Over And. Over Yeah. That's how It works when you're teaching.

It is my first time being on the radio. No, that's okay. That's fair. We're not gonna kill you. I just went. Okay, there's A whole bunch of different stuff here. So her feeding her son now your daughter's A different issue. That's your job. Okay. You took That on when you made the baby. Ding ding. That's how That works. Okay? You didn't take on cheating girlfriend for life 'cause you didn't marry her And. You certainly didn't take on her kid for life 'cause you didn't marry her. You can care about them, but that's different than you having A. Moral, ethical responsibility for their beha. For their wellbeing. The wellbeing. And, moral And, ethical responsibility you have in this whole conversation is one daughter. That's it.


Am I missing something? John? No. I. I'm I'm, I'm still A. Little bit speechless on how you rattled this thing out. Like What. What am I missing here brother. So I I left.

Okay. Having some massive ear issues. Yeah, you're probably done with That Sport, huh? Done with That career. Are you back to work? Are you working somewhere else now?

We're gonna go to A, to premarital counseling. Here's What. It's gonna look like to spend money. You see What? I'm saying I want you to Get. Very clear.

Student loan debt is an epidemic. Defaulting on debt makes you feel even worse. And, it puts everything in A mess. Our question of today, sponsor Why Refi refinances defaulted private student loans.

They're not gonna rip you off. And. you have got A whole fresh start on this thing. If, you have got A defaulted private student loan. Go to Why Refi dot com slash Ramsey. That's the letter. YREF y.com/ Ramsey might not be in all states.


Alright, today's question comes from Meredith in Virginia. Meredith w writes my husband and we started following your baby steps this year. Now That, we are budgeting. It's clear. That A, lot of your money is going towards my husband's alcohol purchases. He enjoys collecting bourbon. And spends 75 bucks A week on his hobby. Okay? You're not following the baby steps. We really need That money to Get out of debt. I'm embarrassed. And frustrated That. He is spending our hard earned money on this unnecessarily. He's defensive. And says he doesn't spend money on anything else. So I shouldn't complain. I don't know how to Get through to him.


Whew. Okay. Well, when you are working your Get out of debt plan, you put your hobbies on hold. That might include your $75 A week for nails, And, facials, And hair care, And eating out And, him buying A bottle of bourbon. but I have A bourbon collection. I can afford it though, and I'm not in debt. And, Do you have A collection or do you have A Museum? Well, Yeah, And, the, this is not about me John, but the but the deal is this.


So I'm not against the idea. I do read in this language. Meredith That, you have A problem with this. That's beyond money. Absolutely. The language you're using. Yes. And. It's A. Very generous. We, we are following your baby steps. We are budget. We're not. We are not. and I think you want this relat relationship to be something That. Your husband does not care it to be And that's underneath all this mess. And. Y'all need to sit down. And have That conversation. Yeah and I. I kind of think. She doesn't want him to have the bourbon too I. Think there's something going on. There. And. That's okay too. That's A fair discussion to have If you know, like your dad was an alcoholic and I don't want bourbon in my house. That's something that's A, that's nothing unfair to have That discussion.


but we don't have to use the baby steps as A weapon to have That discussion. That's A. Different discussion Right. So discussion number one is, you know, I got A problem with bourbon or I got A problem with you collecting bourbon. Or I've got A problem with That. Much alcohol in our house. I, don't Get it. I don't understand. That's fine. That's discussion number one. Discussion number two is putting your hobby, whatever it is, on pause, which we're A hundred percent down with And. Some of the most manly things I've seen men do in the early days of teaching Financial peace University. I had one old guys, serious country boy, And. He had A. Huge fabulous Oh. God my mouth waters. Think thinking about it.


Collection. He had these custom knives from all over the world. I mean this. This was A knife collection. He took his knife collection and I can still see he was A great big old guy. And, his little wife was like five foot one tiny little thing. and I can see her crying in how Happy tears of What her husband had sold this knife collection for $23,000. Whoa. It was A lot I mean it was A. Very nice And. This is like this kid got selling one of his kids as far as he was concerned. but he put What, What, That said was to her is I, put you And our future. And the future of our kids.


Ahead of me. My wants my hobby. I've seen guys do That with their gun collection. And, lemme tell you, redneck sells our guns. It's A big deal. Okay, you that's like, that's A big deal. And. That's What. This is for this guy. Right here probably 'cause guys That Get and I'm, I'm buying sell And Fool around in That world. A little bit And guys. That, Get into this. It's not because they're an alcoholic, it's just That. They enjoy the process of collecting And, tasting And, whatever with bourbon. There's nothing evil about That in my mind anyway. but What you don't wanna do is put this in front of the good of your family. And. That's how she's couching this. I'm suspicious with the wording she's using And, the spaces between the words.


I'm seeing things There. but either way he should stop Yeah until we Get on the same page on this And. So my wife has A A, fairly generous purse collection. That is somewhat one for one with my gun collect Retribution. It's like, It's like A one off. You know it's A. You Get one. I Get one. but it I don't care. It's fine. We got the money. Right. That's not it. It is non-issue. It's something we do for fun. These people are trying to Get outta debt, trying to Get their head above water. You don't do this stuff when you're in That. So he needs to stop this to, to her point. but it also think she needs to fi figure out what's really bothering her Here. And, And. Dave, I've, I've, it's A.


It's A thing. That sets me off A little bit. When somebody, when either spouse sits down, And says, Hey, this thing is A. Big deal to me. And, they are shut down by the other spouse with, Hey, you shouldn't complain. I don't like That language, Dave. It just It pisses me off. If, you feel in your heart. That. Hey, you're my spouse is complaining about something they shouldn't complain about. Y'all need to go see A counselor. but either you have A, whiny, complainy, bratty, spouse, And. Y'all need to go talk to A professional about That. Or you're acting like A baby And. Your response is to say you shouldn't complain. It's like, I'm gonna take my ball. And, go home. Your marriage is on thin ice. If, you start running around like That.


So I, go talk to somebody who can help mediate That. 'cause you guys, you guys got A mess, but there's, you're Right Dave. There's something underneath here. Either he's struggling with alcohol, she don't want this nonsense in her house or this hobby. If you will is A proxy for, she's trying to, to drag this marriage, kicking his screaming into something That. He could care less. He's gonna sit on the couch, And, play his video games, And collect his thing. And. She don't need to complain about it 'cause he earns the money around here. and I just hate That attitude. Here's the thing though, folks in general, okay, $75 A week for anything. Give It A name. That's not necessary for the operation of the family. That's only $300 A month. Does That really keep you from getting out debt? And becoming successful.


No, It does not. Mathematically What It does is it signals everyone in your universe, your wife, your kids, your boss. That. You're not serious, Right. but when you say everything stops, all the alters, I am worshiping ET. All the things That I claim are important are not as important as the future of our family. We are getting out of debt. We're gonna build some wealth. We're gonna have an emergency fund cushion come hell or Hi water, you, you know, you can't do, you know I Get my massage every week, you and I my chiropractor visit. Okay, shut up. Okay.


You know, I, we've had people cut their own hair. It's not an issue for me, but you, You were so serious. Yours just fell out. There. You go, man. That's How serious you got about getting outta dead. That's it. I just took care of it. I. That's Right held your nose real hard. And blew And. It fell. That was, that's gross. That was pretty rough. Sorry, That was bad. You do something my paychecks and I apologize for. So, but it mean Yeah. You, you, you do, you put, You do whatever It takes man. These little, Because they're, they're representative of where your heart is. Yeah where your heart is. Your treasure is also And And. It can be flipped Right. So someone can sit across the table, And, say, dude, this is 300 bucks. Relax, And. Somebody across the table says, Oh, our family's even worth $300.


Right, Yeah, Yeah, It can just, it, it's A. It's A yin yang. It just keeps going in A circle. Just stop. but It's, it's A signal. That Right. It's A signal flare. That says, I'm not in. I'm not in. I'm not, I'm not gonna go all in. I'm not gonna leave it all on the field. And, you don't send That signal into heaven. And. You don't send That signal into your relationships. And into your career.

Oh Yeah definitely Get all That in the store. The three new additions of the, of the other ones are out. Plus this new red box. The red box. Red box. Hey, I want It to be black with an X on It and I got vetoed. So There, you go. Jesse's in San Antonio. Hi. Jesse Welcome to The.


Ramsey Show. Hey fellas, happy Monday. Happy Monday. What's s up in your world? Well, I'm trying to figure out What. My next step is I'm my wife and I are 39 And. Lord willing, If all goes according to plan. Then this time next month we'll be being our new baby girl. Yay. And. So Thank, you And. So We, we, we've been talking for A while planning on my wife staying home after our daughter is born And. So we'll be living off of my income. We are, we're debt free. I'm A, pastor of A Church. And. We are, we've got our emergency fund in order. And. So now I'm prob I'm, I'm, I'm considering myself on step baby.


Step three B or four. I'm set up to have 15% of my income in retirement. but I'm also thinking about possibly having to own A home one day. Right. Now we live in A church owned house And. So I don't need to buy A home And. So I'm trying to figure out balancing saving for A down payment on A house. Preferably A, hundred percent Right. but then also making Sure I have retirement dollars. Yeah. We've worked with pastors for 30 years in these situations, And, it's almost as If the ending of the parsonage surprises them. ET some point. Oh I didn't see That coming.


Well, Yeah you did for 30 years. You saw It coming. And but it, there's something about the process. That lulls you to sleep. So don't do That. If, I'm in your shoes. I'm gonna start paying myself. A house payment. ET A minimum into A Mutual fund. separate from all the baby step stuff. If, you don't want to actually start saving for A down payment aggressively, that's fine. but just you don't have A house payment Payment. So pay one. Right And. So the I guess Why do you seem sad about That? Jesse, you have, Well, I think it comes down to, you know, how much can I actually put aside for I guess paying myself A house payment.


And. So, well I mean you don't necessarily have to pay yourself A $4,000 A month house payment. What do you, what's your household income gonna be with her staying home Around 4,000. About 4,000. Take home. Right. Okay, so I mean If. It's 500 or A thousand dollars. That'd be fine with me. Yeah. Okay, And. So I guess What you're saying is, go ahead And. Put That aside. And, continue investing in retirement. If, you slow down your retirement. A little bit in baby step four because you're saving for A House. That would not be an unusual baby. Step three B, the only difference here is, is we don't have an immediate need for A House.


Right. And. So I was like, I don't feel like I need to be as aggressive since I don't need to actually move Yeah. That's why I'm saying only 500 bucks. 'cause 500 bucks is only, you know, That, that's $6,000 A year. And A thousand dollars is only 12,000 A year. That's not, you're not gonna Get A house anytime soon doing That. So paying yourself A house payment is slowing down. That's What. I was talking about. Okay, If, you were aggressively gonna buy A house by by this time next year. You'd have to do more than That. Right Say That again. I'm sorry. I said If. You were gonna buy A home this time next year. You'd have to be saving more than A thousand dollars A month Oh Yeah. Well, I don't need to buy A home as I I know That. but I'm saying your, so your baby step three B is different.


So we're gonna lighten It up And say all Right, we might do 10% into retirement and I, you know, 500 to A thousand dollars house payment into A Mutual fund. Because these things, there's A bunch of times. Times. but it's interesting. Pastor I, just I don't flash through my head. So I'm gonna say it. I, I I. Actually remember in A Bible study one time A Bible teacher I had 20 years ago walk through And. we went through And, studied all the times in the Bible it says suddenly And suddenly occurs. Never. but it always says suddenly it's like you could see it coming, see it coming. See It coming And. Then suddenly, boom, you know, And, this is, that's what's gonna happen here.


You're gonna have suddenly, but it's not really suddenly. Does That make any sense? Yeah? And, my whole career has been showing up when A real suddenly happens. Right. So you have the planned plane landing. And the number of pastors I've sat with personally who have said I didn't see it coming. Yeah, one of the elders or one of the board members didn't like this sermon. And they man, it's don't one know That It to Now you're looking for A job. And. You're A renter And. you have gotta find A house. And A job on the same weekend. Man, dude, I, Yeah, I That makes me just uncomfortable. And nervous. And nervous, And, uncomfortable. Dave Yeah I. I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna plan.


It's an okay thing for today. It's A nice benefit for today. It's not A bad thing. There's nothing evil about A. Parsonage. And, of course A, lot of churches do A housing allowance. That is tax deductible now for pastors. If, you didn't know That And. So, Or think, think of it. Think of it this way. If. You don't save A house payment And. You put all your money into A retirement And. You make it all the way through And. Then you retire. You're gonna immediately be pulling out of That saved retirement to buy A House. Yep. You're gonna be doing it anyway. Yep. So you might as well plan for If. You Get offloaded on A weekend. That, you don't see coming. That's exactly where We are. That's perfect. That's A. Good way of looking it. It A. Good way of saying It. So anyway, Yeah, let's back It And do 10% or so.


If That helps you figure out the actual numbers of What you were planning to do. 10% on your end of retirement would be $400 A month, 15% will be $600 A month. And. So If you, you know, back it off to 400 And. You say, I'm gonna pay myself A $500 house payment. I think that's acceptable for today, ET least then you're not gonna be caught completely flatfooted. If suddenly is, suddenly. but it's, you know, That, that's the, that's the thing I'm looking for. There is just to try to keep some plans. The mind to man know his ways, but the Lord directs his paths. That's What we're looking for here. And. So it's wisdom into the future.


We're looking into the future trying to see what's There And. It's not we're fortune tellers or something like That. It's just wisdom. So good question is Sir We, appreciate you. Congratulations on the new baby. Appreciate you serving That Congregation There in San Antonio. I'm Sure, they're blessed. This is the Ramsey Show.
