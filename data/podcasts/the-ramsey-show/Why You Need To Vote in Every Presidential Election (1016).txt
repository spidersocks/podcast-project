Number one, bestselling author, host of the Rachel Cruze Show co-host of the Smart Money Happy Hour Ramsey personality. My daughter is my co-host Today, the phone number is triple eight eight two five five two two five. You jump in, we'll talk about your life. And your money. So Rachel, I'm gonna do something That. We don't do 99% of the time on this Show. This Show is about our callers And, their opportunities, their problems, the things That we can help them with in general.


We are neck deep in the middle of an election season. And, I'll be early voting this week, And. Then I'm gonna be away from the microphone A little while. So I'm gonna take A minute here. And walk you guys through something. And. Just stay with me. A minute. Okay, so here's the thing. Most people in America have already decided who they're gonna vote for. You agree with That? Yes. The idea That. There's A. Big block of undecided people out. There wandering around is kind of absurd, really. There's really not A. Bunch of people walking around with their head in A fog. And. Go Oh.


I. Think I. Think all of A Sudden, I had need to learn about this. It's like, no, they, you know about It. Everybody's talking about It. It's everywhere. You can't Get away from it. We're sick of It. We're tired of all these people. We're sick of the whole freaking thing. Most of us anyway. I mean some of you're really into It. You're not sick of it. You just love every moment of It And. You're gonna be desperately have A political hangover in the middle of November. But anyway, the rest of us are like Yeah. Okay, we, we got It. We know What We. Know What. We're gonna do And. There's not A. Big block of undecideds. That are gonna swing this election. I'll tell you who I do want to address though. There is A large block of people. That are not planning to vote. ET all And.


I'm gonna be straight with you. I. Think that's A mistake. Okay. and I wanna walk through with you just A basic decision making paradigm on That idea. So my friend Simon Sinek, who wrote the book Start With Why Infinite Game. Many others, we've spoken on stages together. We've been in think tanks together. We've been friends for years. I, he I. Follow him on Instagram. It popped up on his Instagram. Rachel, yesterday or day before yesterday, That, he had interviewed President Joe Biden And the interview on his podcast. By the way, folks landed last night and I was able to listen to it this morning. It is really good. M it's really good. I did A. Really good interview with Donald Trump.


And. If. You haven't seen That. You ought to watch it. but this is better. It's better. Simon did A better job than I did. and I to the point. That I saw things in Joe Biden. That I've never seen before. And. So I I enjoy getting information. And perspective on things That I didn't have. I'm not challenged. My, my belief system isn't challenged because I learned something about someone. I disagree with That. I actually like Yeah. You know, That doesn't bother me. I'm, it's not, it doesn't cause me to melt down. So anyway, I'm gonna recommend Highly That. You go to Simon Sinek's s podcast. And, listen to this interview. It's really good. Obviously President Joe Biden is not in the thing. Oh, by the way, side note, some of you That were griping about me interviewing President Trump kept telling me it's former President Trump, but former President Trump.


No, that's not correct. Protocol I have A friend That passed away A few years ago. That was the ambassador to France. It was ambassador Joe Rogers. In in. He was A Tennesseean. He lived here in Nashville. I knew him in the real estate business. And from the time he was an ambassador in France. The rest of his life, he was known as Ambassador Rogers. Everywhere I went That, he was introduced. He was introduced as Amba Ambassador Rogers If. You introduce Bill Clinton, you introduce him as President Clinton. President Bill Clinton. Not former President Clinton s And, someone who served as A senator for the rest of their lives. They're call A Senator. That's That is normal protocol. So some of you That are mouthing off about That.


You're just wrong. You don't know What. The flip you're talking about as usual when you're running your dadgum mouth on stuff like That. Okay? So anyway, That was A sidebar, by the way. I'll tell you another one. I'll tell you another one. No, No. Stick with your points. You things down. You need To, you never do this. You do This to go Right. Watch. You need to go watch notes. Go watch Brett Bayer tonight. Brett, one of the more level-headed people on Fox has gotten an interview with Vice President Harris Oh. Great, great. The one, the one I wished I had gotten. Yes, Yeah And. You need to go watch That. I'm gonna be watching it. I'll recommend That one as well. 'cause Brett's pretty I. Like all Yeah. He's pretty, he's pretty straight. He's not like, like blah blah. He's not going crazy. Yeah. So here's the thing. 49% of evangelical Christians surveyed Right now say they're not gonna vote. Wait, how many?


49%. Dang. That's my brothers And sisters in Christ. Because they're disgusted with the quality of the character of both candidates in their minds. That's What. The thing comes out And. That's understandable. 16% of gun gun owners say they're not gonna vote And. That's just 'cause they don't want to Get on the grid. They don't want anybody know where they are. 'cause some of you are just weirdos. Okay? And. You don't have to be A weirdo I about don't have to be A weirdo to have A gun I. I've got guns And don. Not Weird. No I don vote. but it do think they know A lot about us. They know A lot about us, but they know A lot about us. but That, I. Don't think I don't think voting is gonna cause 'em to A. More or less. No I know. Okay, keep going. So here's the thing. You're not voting for A savior If.


So neither one of these will be qualified. You're not even voting for A Pastor If. So neither one of these will be qualified. What happens in your house, is more important to your success than What happens in the White House. but What happens in the White House, does affect your life. And to not vote ET all out of disgust is bad decision making paradigm. You should make A list of the eight or 10 issues. That are out There And. Which side? Each candidate falls on And regardless of the candidate themselves. I, don't believe in voting on A. Single issue. If, you wanna vote Single issue voter, you can, but it don't vote on A.


Single issue. There's not A single issue. That. I will vote on above everything else. I mean there's things. That are more important or less important. but like, you know, There are people. That say, okay, pro-choice or pro-life. I, I. I will not vote anything except That on any other issue. I could disagree with 'em on everything. and I'm, they'll still Get my vote because of That. I don't believe in That. I believe in looking ET the whole thing. And saying, okay, there's the economy, there's inflation, there's interest rates. There's taxes. Which candidate falls on the side of those things? That you believe you can fix or That they're gonna impact. There's the border, the immigration issue. That is real. Which candidate falls on That?


Check the box. Right check the box. Pro-life. Pro-Abortion. Okay, well it, it's Democrat And Republican very clearly on That. Okay? Although Trump is not going to do anything on A federal level for pro-life, he's just gonna let the overturn of Roe v. Wade run its course. And. The states decide Kamala is gonna be pro-abortion. Period. And, they've said this very clearly. I mean it's A standard plank in their party. Okay, pro Second Amendment, And, no question which one you're gonna check There on which If, you're pro-gun or, or your anti-gun. Okay, If, you're anti-gun. You need to vote for Vice President Harris, Even though she has one.


If, you're pro If. You're pro-gun rights. Just 'cause you have got one. Doesn't matter. If, you're pro-Gun rights. She does. You cannot place, you cannot put A check over There. And. don. Again, I'm not gonna vote on A single issue. Okay? Who? Who? If. You're really concerned about the, the social issues around woke. Can I. Can I, can I jump in What about writing in A name? Does That count? You can, but it I. Think one of these two is gonna be President And. You should participate. That's What. I think yes, but it I have A conviction as an American to actively vote. Because I do believe in That. Yep. If someone out. There. Just to even, you know, practice. Yep, That action. Write someone in. Yep. So I'm gonna tell you I'm voting for Donald Trump, not because I'm voting Trump for Donald Trump.


Oh. My gosh. Are we going here? That's okay. But it because I'm vote I checked those boxes. And, more of those are on That side than on the other side. I'm gonna hold my nose. And. I'm gonna vote. I might Vote for co Ken Coleman. That's who I might Write in you and I Ken Coleman We could vote for Ken Coleman. but I'm not. Definitely not.

Rachel Cruz, Ramsey personality is my co-host today. thank you for joining us. Alright, I, wanna wrap up? That thought, And, then we'll move on with the callers. Okay, here's the thing. I have voted in every single election since I turned 18 years old. Presidential election or otherwise. I have not missed A single time to cast my vote as an American I. Believe it's A patriotic duty. I believe it is A, Right and I and I gotta tell you, I think every single vote I've ever cast, I disagreed with the person I voted for on ET. Least something.


Or I wished something was different about them. And. So as my friend Steven Mansfield so eloquently put A while back, he said, all of us If we're honest. And have good decision making skills. And, independent thought. All of us are not worshipers of candidates. Now, There are some of you, That are worshipers of candidates. And, you lose your freaking minds on this stuff. but I'm not one of 'em. Okay? I'm looking. ET ideas, And, which ideas land? On which side of the aisle? Where am I most likely gonna Get? A tax policy. I like an immigration policy. I like A, foreign policy. I. Like where am I most likely to Get A gun policy.


I like A, climate change policy. I like A woke policy. I like That. I agree with Where am I most likely to Get, That and I can check those boxes very clearly, very quickly on these two candidates. And. Then based on That, none of them are going to be A. Hundred percent on What. I want them to be in personal character, in personality style, in history, in even where they stand on the issues. None of them are A hundred percent on exactly who I want them to be. So That means A. Hundred percent of the votes. I have cast and I voted in every election. I've held my nose, And voted.


Anyway, there's something I didn't like, but it voted anyway for the one That most aligned with all the different issues, plus or minus Right. And. Again, I've not, I've never thought I was voting for A savior and I. Never thought I was voting for A. Pastor, some of you think you are And That has you all disillusioned, but it don't think you could find A president? That? You go back, And go, well this was A. Holy man. This was Billy Graham. There's no Billy Graham ever been in the White House. Okay? It just hasn't. It's not, it doesn't happen. There's some, some That were better than others. Some That were more slimy than others for Sure. but it's just not, it's not like their job.


Billy Graham That was his job. And. So it's A different thing. So I I suggest you hold your nose. And you vote And. That's What. I. That's What. I don't mean I. I. I think they stink. And, I'm having, no, I'm saying there's something I disagree with And. I'm gonna vote anyway. And. That's the, that's how I made the decision to vote for Trump was the, the boxes. That were checked. And, I'm If. You wanna vote the other way? As long as you're being thoughtful about it. And, you're being A. Nice person. We're still friends. I'm okay with you. I'm not mad. ET you. Some of you are never gonna listen to me again after this. That's okay. I can deal with That. That's, that's happened to me for 30 years. People have threatened me like I'm going to cancel you. That's A hard to do. I. Own the Show And. So you're not gonna Get to cancel me.


So you can leave, but you can't cancel me. So That, that's, that's, that's What. I. Wanna talk about And? Then the other thing I wanna tell you guys, speaking of interviews, I want you to pick up Simon's interview Simon Sinek. Pick up Brett Bearer's interview on the politics. Non politics. 98% non. We actually got to sit down long form And hang out with Ben Shapiro last week. And That landed today on the Ramsey Network app. And. Tomorrow it'll be on our podcast And. On our YouTube And. So don't miss Ben Shapiro. Very brilliant guy. Long form interview. We got to talk about Judaism. He's an Orthodox Jew. I'm A Christian. And. So And, we've got A. Lot of friends in both camps. That, And we got had A. great discussion on some of That stuff.


Marriage issues, been on marriage. That's something very different. Yeah interesting 'cause his mind's like A freaking of steel trap. He's Yeah. Very interesting. So very cool. So talks About life. Yeah Yeah. We did And And. So be Sure, And. Tune in for all That. That's great. So What, do you want to add to That anything you just wish I hadn't gone There or What? No I Thought That I. Wish you hadn't gone There. I'm shocked you did. To A degree. I was like Oh. My gosh. Are we saying who we're voting for Right now? No I I. Think you know, last time we were in Epcot with our kids, We I made my girls go to the American adventure. It's A. It's A. Show And. The America part of Epcot And. It's about, it's about American history. It's 30 minutes long. And, they have Roosevelt, they have all these presidents.


That come. And tell the history of America. And. You leave That. And. You just think I am proud. I am proud to be an American. Even though you know, There were elements of of our history. That we're not proud of. but who we are as this country. So I think the the rights And the responsibility to vote is huge. and I think that's an older generational thing. So I kind of see you as Papa Dave A little bit in That segment of like, hey, especially to the younger generation. I think it's more of the younger ones. That don't feel the seriousness of voting. So I love the message of go vote. Your vote does Count. Go. Yes, go vote. Because I think That. That is an am A part of America. That's beautiful. And. So do It. And. And. By not voting you can swing an election.


Yes. For Sure. For Sure, big Time. Yeah, And, That, That. That's wrong. Yeah. So vote for who you Yeah vote for who you agree with. I agree. That's A. Great point. I mean If. If, If. Kamala, because of this speech is A, landslide. And. You guys all exercise your vote. I'll take That. Yes, I'm fine. Yes I'm fine. That's okay. Yes. 'cause I want you to Get up off your butts. I want you to think clearly for yourself. Don't stick your head so far up your party. That. You can't think And. Some people do, they can't. Everything that's on That side is Right. No it's not. No it's not. And. All the people, That are on That side are Right. No I have met OIDs on both sides. don mean complete. Crazy people. That should be in A. Padded cell.


Don't tell me everybody That falls on one side of the other is Right. They're not. They're just not. They're just, some of 'em are. No, you're not voting for A savior folks. Anyway, alright, last thing you're gonna hear on politics in Ramsey. For A, long, long time I Hope And. 'cause I really don't want to become those. don don't wanna do A. Political Show. It's not What. I wanna do don? Don't even enjoy It. Rachel actually enjoys It, somewhat That. We have some great she has, we have some great Rachel one-sided family discussions. ET dinner about all this stuff. but One-sided just me. A monologue. Yeah. Just Monologuing. We We definitely have you stirred up for Sure. And. It's fun. You can go There And. but There are A. Lot of fun And. It's always entertaining. but it's not. What we do on the radio. We're here to help Morgan in Pensacola.


Hi Morgan Welcome to The. Ramsey Show. What's s up? Hey, just letting you know I will be most definitely voting. And me And Rachel have That in common. I love talking about politics and I love politics. So good Morgan. Well good. That's why you didn't hang up while I was doing all That in. You were on hold. Right Oh. No I. Thoroughly enjoyed That. Anyway, so, but just short And sweet. Last year my parents needed A place to go. And. It was A consensus. That, they move here on the property. And, they said, Hey, or my dad said, Hey, we will give you A certain amount of money per month.


It'll help you guys out. Help us out. We had, we said Sure. That sounds great. And. Then That happened for like maybe A month or two. And. Then it kind of has been very sporadic since like maybe A. Hundred dollars. A year. And A. Hundred dollars There. How much is he supposed to be paying you? About eight 50. Okay, And. That's What. He promised. He brought it up. You didn't even bring It up. Yeah. He, he threw out That That number. Okay. The first time he missed. Why did you not say something? I just had I.


Hello. Did you, did we lose you Morgan? Now she hung up. Oh shoot. Darn Oh. Well we'll see If, we can Get her back for another segment then. Oh Man. Shoot Morgan. Sorry, Yeah, sorry about That. Here's the thing. If, you don't bring something up that's obvious. People think it's okay. Like when he didn't pay And, she didn't say anything. He starts to think it's okay Because she probably felt bad of like Oh. Well, I'm Sure, it's A. Yeah. That. Like, because the consensus was apparently with her brothers. And sisters. I don't know That, Yeah. They're gonna help mom And dad out. So I think What you need to establish is, does it matter?


If, you were gonna let 'em live There free, then just drop. Whether pays or not, doesn't matter. Just forget it. Yeah, whenever he sends A check, that's fine. Don't worry about it. If, there's something else going on. That. They're wasting money or something. You need to help 'em with That And. Coach 'em. That's fine. If, you really wanna hold their feet to the fire on accountability. Start having discussions about this early And often. but where you made the mistake was not early. So That, that's gonna be the answer to your question. I think, but it we can Get you back. We'll hear the rest of the story. And. That's how We do it here. This is the Ramsey Show.


I've been doing this Show for over 30 years. And, some of the saddest calls I have taken are from situations. That are completely preventable. Yeah And. What's so hard is I feel like one of those, especially the ones That, I'm like Oh, it's terrible. Air people. That Call in And, their spouse has passed away suddenly And, they don't have life insurance. When you have to think through how am I gonna pay my bills? How am I gonna The middle? How be next week? Yeah? How in the middle of all That grief, like it's just It is, it's terrible. And. So life insurance is the one thing, especially as A mom with three little kids. That, I'm like so big on for people to Get because it's inexpensive. Xander is the place That Winston and I actually Get all of our life insurance. And. It doesn't cost much. 'cause Xandr shops among A gazillion different companies. It doesn't cost much. You just have to admit That, someday you're not gonna be here. you have gotta say It out loud.

It was A scary tax bill. So similar to your I.


RS. I got A, VA got our tax bill. And it just We weren't prepared. And. So That made us realize, That, our finances were an absolute mess. And, we had no communication skills. So we decided to clean It up, got our act together, And, after searching for some plans, we found, found yours. And. It just made sense. It was simple. It was easy to follow. So we jumped on. Good for you guys. incredible. So before you guys were scattered, you said you really didn't talk about money. So what's the, what's the before And after picture as you're standing on this stage from where you guys were seven years ago, even as A, married couple, Right, Yeah, I mean like the, your whole life versus today.


What is That transformation. Like, Well it's just we're being honest with ourselves now. Not hiding anything from each other or making purchases without talking to each other. Back then it was just A. Lot of you know, flyby seat, your pants, A. Lot Of individuality. Yes, yes. Totally. Yeah. So how has That has That increased Yeah. So now your Yeah, your marriage, unity, And, everything. Yeah for Sure. Because we agree on What we're spending money on Yes. And. Really it's, it's everything. It's not just And. It. Sometimes we laugh because you'll say like, well I gotta talk to My wife And. It's not like A, you know, I have A whip type thing. Yeah Yeah. but it's more just because we wanna agree.

Vehicles. Vehicles. Yeah, Oh. So we started off, we sold the two vehicles. Right away. Okay, so That was about 55,000 of the debt was gone. And. Then the, the remaining 55,000 was paid over A year. Oh, my gosh, Yeah. So y'all did That, quick Yeah, I had to let go. I had ATVs, snow machines, all the fun toys. All The toys were Gone.

Today's question comes from Carter in New Hampshire. He says, My wife and I are avid listeners, but we don't share the same views financially. I'm an analyzer. When It comes to finances, And, it annoys her to no end I have A two year emergency fund. And. Our home is paid off together. We earn $200,000 A year. She likes to spend, And wants me to co-sign on A vehicle. That's $80,000. She has $10,000 in credit card debt. And, she pays $15,000 each year for private school for our kids. If, I mention anything about money. I'm the one who's wrong. I. Wish. I could say That. We pay for vacations, recreational toys, And trips. but these funds come from my checking account. And, she gets mad when I say That.


I pay for them. Is it okay to have an account together to pay bills And separate for spending accounts? I mean I. Think you guys are disjointed completely when it comes to money. I mean obviously this is like A pick And, choose What. We wanna do together. And What we don't. and I think the goal here is That. You are A unified team with all of it. Right all of it together. So the spending, the saving where your kids are going to college or or to to school where you guys, you know, What kind of cars. You guys buy That, you are in agreement together in those things. And. So some you know she's A spender. So you guys are in A great position. you have no debt, you have great emergency funds.


So If, she wants to go spend A little. You can't be crazy And be like no you can't spend anything. Right And. You sound A little bit. You sound A little crazy to A degree. Carter That, she just wants A. Little bit of freedom. but then she on the other end is not What it sounds like. but $80,000 car debt. And credit card debt. That's crazy. The same value system though is what's not being played out. So I think that's, that's the issue is That, you guys are functioning not on the same value system. And. So it's looking like A mess like this. And, And And the accounts. That doesn't fix it. I think I. People think That I. Think I. Don't think they have your money problem. People think If, they have A A Marriage problem Right. but that's the problem is people think is It. Okay If we just have separate accounts. And, What, That does is It sweeps the one issue That you actually need to talk about under the rug.


It doesn't fix it. It actually continues to alienate you guys from each other. So no Carter I would not do these separate accounts. I would force you guys to work out of one account because to your point, it's actually going to reveal other issues. That are actually going on in your marriage. Yeah And. I'm the one that's wrong. She gets mad. You know, If, you just change out the subject. And. It wasn't money And, you were talking about something else. And. She acted That way or you acted That way. You overanalyzed everything which is What you're doing for Sure. And on the other hand, then she's acting like A. Princess And stomping her foot with her little red face up out till I Get What I want And If.


You don't let me have What I want, then you're wrong. This is A marriage problem. You guys desperately need to sit down with someone. 'cause here's the problem, okay? The probability That, you have A Hi quality marriage going forward using this system is close to zero. You may or may not Get divorced later, but you're definitely not having fun in your relationship. And the probability That you build wealth with both of you pulling ET each other the whole time instead of pulling the wagon. No, almost zero. One of the things we found when We studied wealthy people is the data tells us That, they work together with their spouse.


They're unified in their goals. They're aiming ET the same target. And pulling the trigger together. That's What. We're doing And. You can't drag along A princess. She can't Dr drag along someone who overanalyzes everything. And has no fun left anywhere in life. 'cause you squeeze EveryDollar until George Washington screams And. No you can't. You gotta, you have gotta have something in here We. Gotta have some flow to this, some relationship to this that's not in here. And. So Yeah this desperately screams of A need for marriage counseling to me For Sure Open phones at Triple Eight. Eight two five five two two five.

I'm Dave Ramsey, your host Rachel Cruz. Ramsey personality number one bestselling author, And. My daughter is my co-host today. This is A Baby Steps Millionaire Theme Hour If. You are A millionaire. We want to talk to you. And, learn about you. So That, other people who aren't yet A millionaire can hear What. It sounds like to be one And. How to Get There. Let me help you with What. A millionaire is, some people don't know, some people are confused.


It is not an income of A million dollars A year. You can have A million dollar A year income. And still not be A millionaire. It's possible. Not probable, but it's possible. A millionaire by definition is an accounting term. It is A simple math formula. What you own minus What you owe equals your net worth your assets. Minus your liabilities equals your net worth. When your net worth is greater than $1 million, you are by definition A millionaire. It's not A feeling well. No one should have wealth. It's not A moral construct.


It's A math thing. Well, million dollars isn't enough. Well maybe we can talk about That, but you're still A millionaire If. you have A million dollar net worth. Well, it's all in this house. Doesn't matter. A house is an asset. It's all in cash. Doesn't matter. Cash is an asset. Well, I don't under I. Don't care. If. You understand? This is What. It is. Period. There's only one definition. People say net worth millionaire. That's A redundant term. That's like saying millionaire, millionaire. 'cause all millionaires are net worth millionaires. It is the only kind of millionaire There is there's not another kind.


So you don't have to put an adjective in front of it. It's not net worth millionaire. It's just millionaire And. The data tells us That, most millionaires That become millionaires are boring. They simply invest money in their four Oh. One K their paycheck. And, they pay off their house. And. That's What. Most of 'em do. That's the first one to $5 million. It's just the old And. Matter of fact, James, our producer, found the video of an actual millionaire versus the typical American fire. That up And. Let the people on YouTube see it. And Rachel and I will do A play by play of What A real millionaire looks like versus most people.


Here we go. You ready? It's the tortoise versus the hare. The classic. You know the story. The hare's always distracted looking ET things. They can't afford buying things with money. They don't have to impress people. They don't even really like. They have A, great gun collection, A great purse collection. And cars, That they can't afford parked in front of A cheap house. Meanwhile the tortoise just keep saw A walking. This is A live video of an actual tortoise. Actual, this is A tortoise actually winning the race, beating the hair Yeah. It's actually some of our YouTube geniuses here.


It's Actually A. Really? Yeah found That. It's not Bad, but it's A. It's A. It's A. Big old tortoise. It's A huge tortoise And. It doesn't stop And. The pace is consistent. Did you see he just kept the same pace, just kept going. And, That hair was kind of back. And forth. Looking up, looking around. And. That's It don. Like it's all distracted. don It is, it's it And. It's boring All financially. A. DD. It's not flashy. I mean it's Yeah. It's not the cool, like no There do this new thing. There We could actually name the hare Bitcoin. Oh. My gosh. And. we could name the tortoise Millionaire. There. You go Right because that's What happens. You're just distracted. You're looking for A. Quick, easy way. A, And, And, all the people cheering for you. They, they're not helping. 'cause you're still just gonna going be your own worst enemy going all The way around. Yeah. And. By the way, I I was A hare in my twenties and I lost everything.


And went broke And. So I have adopted the tortoise personality since then. And the tortoise haircut. So, and look like A tortoise. I'm full on tortoise ET this point. I don. I'm big time into tortoises. So, because I found What works. And, I'm sticking with It. So we're talking to real millionaires, not your broke brother-in-law with an opinion. Alex is in Charlottesville, Virginia. Alex, what's your net worth? About 1.5 to 1.6 million. Cool. Gimme A. Little breakdown by category. How much in-house? And? Four, Oh, one K, And, so forth.

Congratulations Millionaire. Very, very proud of you folks. Here's the thing, you've heard the lie. It's all over the place. That, all wealth is inherited in America today. We did the largest study of millionaires ever done in North America. 10,167 of them in detail. Airtight research technique had an outside research firm look over our shoulder because We knew some of the left wing nut jobs would not like the conclusions. So this data is What is known as facts. If, you disagree with this. You're what's known as wrong.


89% of America's millionaires are not millionaires because of inheritance. Some of them, like these guys got some after they were millionaires, some of them got A. Very small inheritance like this last one. And, most of them got zero. No, 89% nine out of That should give you hope. That means you can do it. Nine out of 10 millionaires in America did it without an inheritance. Hmm. This is the Ramsey. Show


Hi guys. Dave Ramsey here and I got A. Big announcement. I'm coming to A City near you. Live on the money And relationships tour with Dr John Delony. This is the most interactive event we've ever done. You Get to decide What. We talk about you do not want to miss this. We'll be coming to Louisville, Durham, Atlanta, Phoenix, Fort Worth, And, Kansas City in April, And May of 2025. Get your tickets And more information. ET Ramsey Solutions dot com slash tour.


Thank you for joining us America. This is A baby steps millionaires theme hour. We're so glad you are with us. It's important to know That wealth in America today is not coming from inheritance. It's not coming from being famous. It is not coming from A. 4.2 GP A. Not A. Bad thing to be That smart, but most of us aren't. That smart. And, you do need some gray matter. A 1.6 probably won't cut It, you're probably not gonna Get There If. You graduated with A degree in beer pong. You might make it, but it doubt It. So What are we trying to do here?


We're trying to say There are some uses out There. There are some things That people believe. If you. Get. A. Hi. GP A. And. You go to A, an expensive college. That is famous That. That's gonna make you A millionaire. There's no data to support That going to A. Good school getting A. Good degree. That's very usable in the marketplace. And getting A reasonable. GP A is typically around A. Three point. Oh is What we find is an indicator. That, you're gonna be There. and I'm not telling you to goof off I mean If. You can Get A 3.4, go Get, It, A 3.8. That's fine. Go Get It. but That doesn't mean That. You're more or less likely. Okay? That's not how this works.


So the da, the data tells us That. You know That, most of these people do have A. Four year degree. There is A correlation There. but they have useful degrees. You know, electrical engineering, business, business, business, criminal justice didn't use It became it. So I mean this is, this is, this is the pattern we see throughout these millionaires. That we study, what's The joke? That B students usually A students work for B students later Life. It's actually it. It, it's A joke was also A data back thing. You it'ss Just the idea of like, Yeah. Go, go figure it out. You're okay. Don't stress about I. Don't know every single thing. Yeah don't.


You're not gonna die over this Oh And. By the way, people don't steal their way into wealth. Either. You Get to go to jail, If, you do That And in today's world. If, you're A crook. Everybody knows it. 'cause everybody tells everybody. There's all kinds of places to prove, you know, put out There, the sky's A crook. This girl's A crook. So this idea, That, all wealthy people are crooks is absolutely asinine. There's the same percentage or less percentage of crooks among the wealthy than There is among the regular other, straight up on the socioeconomic ladder. And by the way, all poor people aren't crooks either, but some of 'em are all rich people aren't crooks, but some of 'em are because there's always A percentage of morons.


It's just part of the deal. And. It's not getting to do with wealth. You know, Yeah and I think A. Matter of fact, integrity is actually an indicator. That, you're gonna become wealthy And I. Think A point of this segment. Number one is, is to prove That. You can still win financially today. Right, like If, you put things into place you can win And. The benefits of winning financially is not That because you have X amount of zeros in your accounts, means That, your life is suddenly better because There are rich, miserable people out There. but it's What. You do with That money. That creates A life. That is full. You can still have A full life. And not be A millionaire Right. You can still have joy.


And ha. This is not an indicator of any of That, but it, but it is A ability. Our last caller said it and I loved it. Where he is like it's just freedom. You know, like money ISS A tool to create A life. That, you love And, you have options. And, you have the ability to do things you wanna do when you have the monetary means to be able to do it. And, That, that's A spouse staying ET home. Like whatever That looks like for you. And. So for this, you know, I think that's an important point, isn't it? Right, it's not just to become A millionaire. 'cause suddenly your life's gonna be fixed because it's not. There's A lot of really, you know, people That relationally are not great in their millionaires. You know, And, they, they don't talk to their families. Like it's, it does, it's not an indicator. That. your life is gonna be perfect, No matter of fact, What wealth does is It magnifies every area of your life.


It magnifies the good, And the bad in your life. If, there's crazy in your life. You Get A, lot of crazy in your life. There's chaos in your life. You Get A, lot of chaos in your life. If, there's anger in your life. You're gonna Get A. Lot of anger in your life. money makes you have more of whatever it is That's Right And. So the If, you're happy, And generous, you're gonna have A. Lot of happy And generous. Yep. And the character part of you. So those of you That aren't here yet. And say, okay, I wanna Get There who you are in the process is as important, More important, More important as the numbers in That account. Right. So that's why giving, we always teach in the budget. Giving is the very first thing you do regardless of where you are financially. Like practicing these habits of selflessness, And living with an Open hand.


'cause as you Get more, you're gonna become more of That And. That's an indicator of joy, And peace in your life when you're A giver. So, so who you are in this process is, is really important. And, we And, we, we care about That. So it's, it's very, very important. Jesse is in Madison, Wisconsin. Hi. Jesse, what's your net worth? Good afternoon, Mr. RAMSEY. And, thank you for you And, your team having me out today. I, truly appreciate your time Sure, my net worth is just over $1 million. Good for you. And, gimme A. Little breakdown by category Sure. So investments between Roth IRAs four, Oh one KTSP is just over 680,000. That's not including my military or state retirement.


5 2 9 of 21,000. We've got about 280,000 of equity into our house. We still have about 217 on our mortgage And. Then the rest is emergency savings. And some assets of about 72,000. Good for you. That's great. And, how old are you? 37 And. How much of this did you inherit? None. Zero. And What, do you make A year This year? About 250 K or 200 5K What. Do you do I work in cybersecurity in the Army National Guard. Ah, good for you. Okay. Alright. Right four year degree. Yes. Actually And kind of when I was listening to the last caller, And.


And, when you guys came on, it was A four year degree but never really used it. And ironically I recently went back to A Technical College for it. And cybersecurity, And networking, Yeah Yeah, best investment I ever, ever made. It was cheaper and I was able to cashflow It because of the post nine 11 GI bill. That's awesome. Big time. So What was your GP A on That or is That A The bachelor's? It was A three point 12 for the bachelor's. And then I and of got my act together. A little bit more for and I was A. Little bit wiser Yeah but 3.98 for the tech college. Ah God. Okay, so What was your four year degree in History. History. Very good. Okay, cool. Good for you.


You think this can still be done? If? You're A 37-year-old looking ET. A 22-year-old out There. Can they still do this in 15 years? Oh? Absolutely. The three things That really worked for us were the budget. My family jokes about me nerding out over our budget all the time. but one of the things I wish I would've done A lot earlier in my life because I would've seen not to spend on kind of pointless items. That didn't really pro, you know, give me the opportunity down the road as well as starting to invest earlier and I wish I would've done it. Even If it was A little bit. It still would've made, you know, big difference. My older self would've thanked my younger self A. Lot more Yeah in the time in the market. What, do you drive Oh A 2021 Toyota Sienna A Toyota.


Of course you do. Good gosh It's A, it's the dad van. but it love That thing. I need I. We need A sponsor. I got A. A We need A sponsor for this hour. The Toyota Toyota Hour.

Yes, We up There on the, on the old YouTube. So very cool. Sweet. So sweet. Congratulations brother. Very, very proud of you. Good stuff. So one of the things That people Get confused on is the difference between A Millionaire, And, A, billionaire millionaires do not have private jets. Second homes, And. They don't drive 200 And, $45,000 Lamborghinis billionaires do or can.


So the, you know, sometimes people Get really confused. Most millionaires live in A Standard house, maybe slightly above average. And, they drive A Toyota And I. Think what's hard is I. Remember when I was A kid? So this was What 20 years ago. There was A movie call, blank check on Disney Channel. You probably don't remember it, you're Right. but they, this kid like picks s up, A blank, check And. He types in $1 million. I mean this is in the early nineties. And, he buys A Castle, he gets A limo with A driver. Like he's like shows Oh Yeah. It's like this crazy lifestyle for $1 million. So I do think there's like this nostalgia of like If I have A million dollars I.


You know What I mean like, it's like, It's like I. It'll do more than it'll actually do. Buy I Get to buy A Castle And have A. Driver Yeah. Probably not. Not much of A Castle. Not much of A Driver If you did so, but it's A great start And. That's why we feature It. 'cause we want give you guys hope That, it is entirely possible. If, Y'all can find A blank check meme.
