And it's probably way worse than where you are today.


See, I used to be like a walking financial red flag. If you were a credit card company, I would not have given Mel Robbins a credit card. If I were a bank, I would not have given Mel Robbins a mortgage. If I were a bill that was being delivered to Mel Robbins house, I would not have expected to have been paid. I'm about to tell you some very embarrassing stories about how bad I used to be with money. So If you got unpaid bills, if you're living paycheck to paycheck, if you've got insane, embarrassing credit card debt or student loans that are bearing you alive, I have been there. I know that pain because I have felt that pain. And I need you to hear me say this. You can get good with money.


In fact, you can learn how to be great with it. It took me 15 years to climb out of the financial hell hole that I had created for myself and learn the skills and habits that led me to where I am today. And I want you to learn from my mistakes. So today I'm gonna walk you step by step through the things that you should be doing immediately to change your financial future. Starting today. And I'm gonna be doing it with the help of a very good friend of mine who is our guest in our Boston Studios. Today I'm talking about the one and only Louis House. Lewis is a New York Times bestselling author. He's also a two time all American athlete.


You may recognize his name or his voice because for the last 12 years, he has hosted The School of Greatness podcast, where he interviews some of the most successful people on the planet in business, entertainment, sports science, health, medicine, money, and so much more. And here's what I love about Lewis. He's been where I was dead, broke, no clue of what to do next, but he figured it out just like I figured it out. And that means you can figure it out for you too. And today, he and I are joining forces to help you unlock your financial greatness. And what I love is that Lewis, he's just a regular guy. We're not talking fancy degrees or complicated talk about markets.


He was able to turn his life around using the tools he's gonna share with you today. He's also written a brand new book called Make Money Easy, which I've read. And it's fantastic. So are you ready to get good with money? I thought so. So please help me welcome my friend Louis Howes, to The Mel Robbins Podcast, Louis Howes. Welcome to Boston. Welcome to Mel Robbins podcast. I'm so fired up that you're here. I'm pumped. Well, I wanna congratulate you. Thank you. I think this is your best work ever. Thank you. And it is hitting the world at a moment where money feels so hard and finances feel hard. And the news headlines are hard.


And so I cannot wait for you to share with us how to make money easy. Thank You. Yeah. And I wanted to start by having you speak directly to the person who is with us right now. This is somebody who does not have a lot of time, but they have made time to be able to learn from you. Could you tell them what they might expect to change about their life if they take everything that you and I are about to share with them today? And they put it to use Now more than ever, it seems like it's scarier than ever because you don't know if you're gonna have a job in six to 12 months with ai. You don't know If you can afford your bills, your rent, your car payments, food.


Like you said, you know, egg prices are going through the roof. It's like $10 for an egg or something now. Gas prices are through the roof. The economy inflation is still high. It just seems like harder and harder to get ahead, to stay ahead and to get more than month to month ahead. So now more than ever, there's uncertainty and fear and it seems scary, but it's also a time of great opportunity if you can have clarity on what you want, why you want it, and where the money's gonna go. I think a lot of people think it needs to be hard and stressful to make money. And it needs to be complicated. And it doesn't need to be complicated.


You just need to learn the tools and have the courage to be curious to understand more. I love that. And the other thing that's, that is applicable here is that if you're listening and you're in the middle of reinvention, 'cause something has happened in your life or you're in a decade where you feel like you don't know who you are or what your purpose is and you're just feeling overwhelmed and lost, you could actually find purpose by saying, I'm gonna learn how to be good with money. Yes. But if we go back in time, because I think your story is very relatable. You have no money, you are sleeping on your sister's couch.


How old are you at this point? 23 and a half to 24. So could you put us at the scene and tell us what was happening? And then once you put us there, I'd love to know how would you have described your relationship with money or what the person looked Like? Oh man. Yeah. I mean, I, I was sleeping on my sister. I, I pursued the dream to make the NFLI never made it, but I played in the Arena Football League and in the Arena Football League. I was making $250 a week. And I was living in a, a free apartment with another teammate that they put us up on the team and we had food stamps to pay for food during the week. So this is in Huntsville, Alabama, 2007. And again, $250 a week you can't live on.


So it was, they paid for our rent and they gave us food stamps and about a thousand bucks a month. Wow. And I didn't care at the time 'cause I was getting to live my dream. Most people I talked to my nephews and nieces and their friends in their early and late twenties. They don't know their purpose. They don't know how to manage their, their emotions, how to regulate emotions, how to navigate their nervous system. They don't know how to navigate when someone's ghosting them. They're just in chaos mode emotionally. And they don't understand, why am I here? What's my purpose? Right. Let alone understand money. They don't have the energy to even think about money. Got it. So, but back then you had a sense of purpose. I had purpose. And you were directed so you weren't, weren't screwed like a lot of us are in our Twenties. Exactly. I was at least clear, but I didn't have the ability to regulate my emotions still, I was still a mess emotionally, but I was excited about the path that I was on with my, my career at the time, which was playing sports.


Got it. So is there also this sense in looking back that at that exact moment, even though you were hand to mouth, literally Yeah. Yeah. You were not stressing about money because you had something bigger that you were focused on. Yeah. And then bare necessities were covered. I could live off very little and yeah, my rent was covered. You know, we, you Can buy a lot of ramen with 250 bucks a week. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Yes. Okay. I didn't need a lot Then. You're 23 don't need a lot if your rent is covered, right? Yes. And so What happened? I got injured. I had to have a surgery. I had a a, a bone taken outta my hip, put it into my wrist. And I was in a cast for six months. So during that time, it was a lot of stress because I was thinking about, oh, I can't play football again.


I don't have a college degree. I'm in all this debt. I don't have any savings. I can't walk still. 'cause they took a bone outta my hip and I had 15 staples in there. I couldn't use my arm. So I was just feeling like the grief and sadness that my dream was over. I had no backup plan, no college degree, no money. You know, I'm a grown man in my young twenties, but I feel like a child. 'cause I'm sleeping on my sister's couch. She's providing, she's taking care of me. She's feeding me. You don't feel worthy If you can't take care of yourself, If you don't feel like you can appreciate your own value or believe in yourself that you're capable of creating or generating. It's, you have shame and guilt associated with that.


And that energy made me feel worse. I had to first learn how to grieve the loss of my dream. Grieve. Wait, so you're, so, you're like 23 years old. 23 with your hand permanently. Like in a high, in this position. This for six months. For six months. You can't walk. You have no money. You are no longer on the team. Nothing. And it makes sense that you would not feel motivated to get a job or to feel like you had any sense of purpose. And I think that this moment of the story, a lot of people can relate to whether or not you were going for a dream or not. This sense of I'm just existing right now. Yeah. And trying to understand what, why am I here?


What's the pers purpose of my life? If this was my dream and I felt like I was supposed to do, most people don't even know what they're supposed to do. I knew what I wanted to do, but now it's done. So it was like, what's the point of this? Also, my dad had gotten into a pretty bad car accident about a year and a half before that. So he was still recovering from this accident, this brain trauma that he had. And he was never the same man again. So I was losing the loss of my dad emotionally. He was physically alive, but emotionally a different person. And this was also in 2008 when you know how bad the economy was, the housing market crashed then it kind of felt like the uncertainty of right now, 2025, there's a lot of uncertainty.


What's gonna happen. Oh, it's, It does feel financially similar, Doesn't it? There Isn't a crash in the market, but it feels like people can't afford anything. Yes. Right. We don't know how to afford anything. And we don't know, are we gonna be able to keep making money in the future? People are losing their jobs left and right. Gas price keeps going up. I can't afford rent. How can I save to even get ahead? Yes. So it had that feeling, that energy for me. I was just like, I don't know what to do. And I felt stuck. I felt trapped. I felt paralyzed. You know? That's exactly how I felt. I mean, And here you are, 23. I was 41 when this happened. If you know you're listening and you don't know kind of how I got started, it's very similar to Lewis.


And right around the same time, right around 2008, my husband had got into the restaurant business and we had secured the whole thing with our house. Like complete morons. We also cashed out every credit card we could get. And took out a home equity line loan, cashed out the kids college savings, the 401k, all of it. All of it. All of it was, you had no investments left. You had no Nothing. Really. Yeah, you can, now you're looking at me like, wow, you're a real lady. Now I Didn't know you took out the, the kids' college fund money. Oh Yeah. Oh wow. Dude, everything. You were all in. We were all in. 'cause the first location, little pizza joint did well. And so, you know, we, we let scale this thing, oh, let's scale this thing. We listened to all the fricking entrepreneurs out there going like, don't give away equity.


Like go all in on yourself. Because what could go wrong in the restaurant business every Day. So looking back, I can laugh, but of course what ended up happening is 2007, 2008, there was a huge recession and the housing market collapsed, which meant the house, even though we owned a house, because we had secured the business with the house and home equity lines and credit cards, the house was not worth anything because of the amount of debt leveraged against it. And so, so you couldn't sell It? Oh my. No. 'cause we would've owed money. Yeah. Yeah. And so we were just, that, that feeling of being paralyzed. And I lost my job and I remember feeling so ashamed.


And you know, I had made the vision boards, I had had a vision for my life. And nowhere on any of the collages that I created about my dream life was an image of alcoholism, bankruptcy. Oh. A million dollars in debt. Like none of that. And so when you said paralyzed, I remember because there's an excruciating level of stress that you never forget when you cannot pay your bills. Can, You're living in that fear and stress and anxiety. Oh yeah. Like and I had this whole line, Louis, because I knew that I, I would go into the grocery store knowing that the checking account was in the red.


Hmm. Gosh. And I would have this whole line rehearsed where I'd be standing at the checkout counter and they'd be scanning the items, beep beep. And I'm thinking, dear God, let there be an electronic, oh my gosh. Glitch. And I have a kid, or two or three of them with me. And you're like, let them have a glitch. Let them Yes. Let them, let them please. And they would, I'd pass over the card, debit or credit. I'd go credit. 'cause I knew if I hit debit it would de cash. Yes. And when it ultimately, there were times where there was a miracle and it, it went through. But when it ultimately didn't go through, I had this whole line rehearsed.


I would just cock my head and go, well that's strange. It it just worked at the gas station. Wow. Let me, let me, I'm just gonna run out. Just, you can hold the girl. I'm gonna run out to the car because I've got some money out there. And we would And It never come back. No. Oh my gosh. And That's the shame associated with that. Oh, the, the the stress, the, the judgment. Oh, it's not fun. Yes. And then the anger. Mm. That I'm in this situation. Because as much as I wanted to blame Chris or the business, I was just as big of a cheerleader. I said, let's go all in. Yeah, of course. I ignored the advice of the experts. Like, I like did this too. So how did you start making money At that time? In 2000 7, 0 8 and oh nine, LinkedIn was just getting started really.


And the president of my school that I had a relationship with, I reached out to him and he said, go on LinkedIn and, and try to find a job on, on LinkedIn. So that's what I did. I just took his advice and I started emailing and messaging executives in Columbus, Ohio and asking them to meet with me. And I started going to Toastmasters 'cause I was afraid of public speaking. And at Toastmasters, this is what I started to develop skills at Toastmasters. I met really great public speakers who were executives in my, my city as well. And some of those started helping me out. I remember one time I went to a Toastmasters session, which is for public speaking. This was when I was in my cast. I went to this Toastmasters, I swear to God I had to have a cutoff shirt because shirts wouldn't fit over the cast.


It was so bulky. I had to have a cutoff shirt. I went to this Toastmasters, I give speeches like this, believe it or not, this is crazy. Like rookie, the guy from Rookie of the Year. But I didn't have superpowers with that. And so I'd get up in front of a podium and give a speech and I'd stutter. I was terrified. I could not speak. I would read aloud word for word. The thing that I would say like this, you know, and I'd speak word for word that I wouldn't look up at anyone. I was so terrified. But I knew at that moment that if I didn't go all in my, all into my fears, the fears would never disappear. So I just said, I gotta go all in on this. And at this one Toastmasters club that I went to, they had like, I don't know, like snacks in the back. And I shit you not, this was, this is so sad, but this is what it took.


At that time I had really baggy jeans that I would wear and a cutoff shirt to this like professional board meeting, speaking in the back. They had, you know, carrots and broccoli and like dip. And I was getting napkins, stuffing carrots and broccoli and crackers in my pockets. 'cause I had no foo, I had no money for food at this time. And this guy tapped me on the shoulder. He goes, what are you doing? I go, I literally was like, I don't have any money. I'm sleeping on my sister's couch. Like I just got injured playing football. I'm trying to figure out life. And he said, lemme get you some lunch. He took me down the street, got me some lunch and he became one of my mentors named Frank Agan. And he coached me on public speaking.


We wrote my first book together. He co-wrote it with me. A book about LinkedIn after about a year and a half. So I was just putting myself out there to learn new skills and many people. And people started helping me by when I put myself out there. These are embarrassing stories that I don't tell anymore because it's like I didn't have any money. I was taking food wherever I could get it and stuffing it in my pockets. That's how bad it was. Well, yeah. But I think the important thing here is that you were not sitting on your sister's couch. I took massive action. You Took massive actions. I was Emailing people, I was going to clubs. I was learning salsa dance. I was like, whatever I can do to develop skills. And by the way, reaching out through LinkedIn made you an expert on LinkedIn.


Yes. Which is what you then started marketing yourself at. Started making money around that skill that I developed. Correct. Something I had no clue how to use in the beginning. And made a lot of mistakes around. I eventually learned to master it and people started coming to me and saying, Hey, can you teach me about how you're using LinkedIn to build all these relationships and network with mentors and leaders? And I started hosting these LinkedIn networking events for free around the country because I was building groups and communities on LinkedIn and bringing people together. I didn't know how to make money with it at first. But then someone said, Hey, can I have a, a sponsorship booth here and promote my business for 200 bucks? I said, sure. Okay. Ding, ding, ding. Let me sell more sponsorships.


Then someone said, will you do one-on-one consulting with me to optimize my LinkedIn profile? Sure. Okay. They paid me. Then I said, why don't I just write a book about this and sell the book at these events. Hmm. So that's where all these things started to come. It was right in front of me. This wasn't like, my dream in my life is to teach people about LinkedIn, but the money was available right there. So it was part of the mission to make that money, to help me get outta debt, to help me get off my sister's couch, to be able to pay for my own apartment, to buy my own food. All these different things. To not rely on anyone else. As I started to save that money and have more in the bank and realized I'm not gonna go broke. I had maybe two years of runway of savings and I was also living very beneath my means.


I was paying 4 95 a month for a rent in Columbus, Ohio. I didn't have a car. I walked everywhere. I mean, I was living frugal life. Wow. As the LinkedIn guy. As The LinkedIn guy. Wow. I was taking Greyhound buses, you know, to to events. I was like, oh, 'cause you're like around the country. I'm like, how the hell's he pay now? Now I know how you're paying for it. You're taking the bus. I was taking the bus. I was taking like the cheapest middle seat of back of like Southwest, wherever I could go. I was staying on friends' couches. I was afraid to spend at that time also. I would stash it, but I wouldn't spend it. 'cause I didn't wanna go back to the couch and be broke again. Same. Same. And there's a season for everything. Right. You don't wanna blow it all when you get it. Right. But over this time, this is probably a five year window. I started to make good money.


I started to save money. I started doing online courses and hosting events and just doing anything that was right in front of me to make money. Got it. And I think that's the right thing that people should do. Of Course. And I think it's also important to hear, you're talking about a five year period, five year, year period. And you're also talking about, okay, first I took the bus. Yes. I'm sleeping on people's couches. I'm saving, saving, saving, saving. And five years of just putting in the reps. And that's it. Doing, pushing this forward. You're now in a different place. And what happens? So then I started to reevaluate, do I really wanna be making this type of money? Like do I want to go online and just teach people about how to optimize their LinkedIn profile for the 10000th time? Yep. It wasn't my calling anymore.


Got it. It was right for the time, but not for the next season. Okay. So I started to evaluate and I was like, what are the things I really enjoy about this? What are the things that I'm loving the most? What would I like to do? What would be amazing to be able to make money doing something with my time? And everything went back to, I really love just like connecting with people who are doing inspiring things on LinkedIn and asking them questions. Everything they're teaching me taught me how to build my business now. And everyone was asking me like, Louis, how did you build this business so fast? I mean, five years for me was fast where I was doing I guess, but I thought I could have been faster. They were like, how did you build this? And I go, I honestly just like asked the most successful people that I knew that I could find.


And I just did what they told me. That was it. And I go, oh, maybe people would want to hear these things. Hmm. Huh. Okay. How can I interview people and make money with it? I don't know. But I, I'm hearing this thing called podcasting coming out. This was 2011, 2012. And I was like, maybe you can make money in this one day. And so I had two friends who had a podcast and I called them, this was early stages. Like you were like a literally, there was like A thousand people in the world Podcasting, you know, a pioneer. Yeah. Nobody knew what this was. You just were like, huh. No one knew. And I, and that wasn't a really a way to make money back then. Right. But I knew it would fuel like my heart's desire.


Hmm. I was like, if I can interview the world's smartest people and I can share that information with others for free, that's gonna make me feel good. Hmm. And that's generous mindset. Hmm. So it was helping me, but it was helping others. And so I literally just researched it for a few months and I was like, ah, let me just record one on my phone. I did it with Robert Green was my first interview. And with Robert Greener. Robert Green was my first interview. Yeah. Oh. But Geez, very the lead for crying out loud. It was loud. A big one. Yeah. It was a big one. And, and I was hooked. I was just hooked. Even though like 10 people listened in the first week or whatever, I was just like in my first year of podcasting, that was a full year of me every single week doing an episode and then messaging everyone on LinkedIn and Facebook one by one saying, Hey, go Listen to This episode.


I think you might like this one part. It was just a little reps every single day for that whole year to get that. And I made $0 in the podcast the first year. It took me years to make money with it. Now it fed my soul. Didn't feed my bank account. But again, this is that five year run. Yes. When you were the LinkedIn guy sleeping on couches and taking buses and sitting in the middle row of the back of the airplane Yes. To try to get places and you're like putting in the Lego bricks to build something. That's exactly what you were doing when you jumped into podcasting. Yes. And I started and I developed skills and confidence and reps and I understood certain things. And I had a certain level of credibility at that point where I was like, okay, lemme go launch this. I feel confident even if I don't make money, I'd save money.


And I was still building the other business. I was still running things, but I just wanted to get away from that eventually. Well what, so it took years to get away from it. Well, What I love about the story, Lewis, because here we are 12 years later, you have one of the most successful podcasts in the world. You're an inspiration to certainly me. Like you're one of the people I used to look at and be like, boy, didn't I start podcast? Look, Louis is already doing it. I ca you know, like literally you inspired me. You blazed a trail for people. You showed people it was possible to build a business around it to make a difference. Thank you. Appreciate It. You know what's interesting, Louis, is that if I think back to how scared and paralyzed I was at that period in my life, my story for quite a while was, we're never gonna get out this.


I'm never gonna fix this. I will always be this stuck. I will always, I will never figure this out. We're gonna lose everything. And I can see for months and months telling myself that story kept me spiraling in place and it hid from at least my view and my motivation, my ability to see some of the things that the expert said. This is what you do when you're in that situation. It certainly doesn't change things overnight, but there are simple actions you can take that If you felt like, okay, I'm gonna figure this out.


Okay. I I I I'm smart enough to listen to Lewis Yeah. And to read make money easy and to listen to information that is gonna help me. Because people have been in this situation before that you can actually figure this out And that you can learn to make money easy. That that is what motivates you to start doing something different. Is that why this matters? A hundred percent. I mean, you were just saying exactly how I was feeling back then. That money is hard, money is stressful. I don't understand money. I went all in on money, but then it just escaped me. And now it's left me in this horrible place. I'm never gonna get out of this place. It's always gonna feel hard. I'm always gonna be overwhelmed.


Right. And that's what you kept telling yourself. Yes. As part of your story. And it's too hard for me to figure this out and it's too hard for me to get outta debt. Yeah. There's No way to get out. I think a lot of people think it needs to be hard and stressful to make money. And it needs to be complicated. And it doesn't need to be complicated. You just need to learn the tools and have the courage to be curious to understand more. And when you don't understand something, it seems extremely complicated. But right when you start to figure it out, right. When you start to be able to pedal and stay in alignment on that bicycle, you're like, this is so easy. It's effortless. Most people are unwilling to get on the bicycle and fall a few times.


Hmm. Because they just don't understand it. This foreign object over here, how am I supposed to sit on these two wheels and go down the street without killing myself? It seems so foreign and scary until we do it. It seems like, why was I ever afraid of this in the first place? Are there commonly agreed to steps that after 12 years of interviewing so many financial experts on The School of Greatness that help you manifest money, success, and happiness? Lewis, One of the common themes that some of the wealthiest people in the world all have told me through The School of Greatness show is that the more they give, the more they're generous with their money, the more they make, the more they earn, the more comes to them.


And when you have no money, yes. It's hard to think, oh lemme just give my money away. Let me be generous with it because you don't have much. But they all tell me that that's the place when you need to learn and develop this habit. Not when you have a lot to give, but when you have a little to give, it's not how much you give to people, it's that you're giving something. Okay. A generous mindset Being generous. So If you were giving advice to you, yes. When you're on your sister's couch stuff in broccoli in your pocket that like you got nothing, dude, how do you be generous and adopt that when you feel like you have nothing to give? If You have no money to give, can you give time? Oh, I love that. And one of the things that got me to where I am, and you could, you could probably tell, because you've known me for eight years this month.


We met eight years ago, and you've seen me over the years. And the thing that I bring to the table, I feel like is I'm curious and I ask people questions and I get them to open up and talk about themselves in unique ways just like you do. And that is a generous thing that we can do. Mm. And when I was early on, these mentors, I would reach out to people on LinkedIn and initially I said, Hey, can you gimme some advice? I'm broke. And no one replied. I can't imagine why, you know, No one replied to me because no one wants to give their time to someone who needs something from them. I was taking from them, Hey, I'm broke. I've got no skills. Can you give me 20 minutes of your time so I can pick your brain?


I know you get that all the time. We don't have time. So I realized, oh, this, this strategy isn't working. Let me actually dive in deeper on the person I'm wanting to learn from and actually research their story, learn about the things they overcame, read some articles about them and see if I can like find something unique that is meaningful to them and see if they're willing to tell me about that. So I started emailing people differently saying, gosh, it's really interesting how you, you overcame this one challenge in your career and you jumped to this position. I'd really love to hear about the mindset you had when you were facing that challenge and what got you there. I'm not asking for advice. Hmm. I'm asking for someone to relive a story that is triumphant for them.


And one by one people started replying. Say, yeah, I'll call you. I'll, I'll take you out to Bright. They're buying me lunch just to tell me their story. And I'm not asking for advice, but they're giving me all the advice they have through their storytelling. And so there's, If you don't have money, you can be generous with your time. You can be generous with your energy, with your questions, and you can have a generous attitude. You can be of service in some other way. Hmm. You can show up to support at your local church. You can just call a friend and say, Hey, I know you're struggling right now. Can I take you out? Can we go for a walk? Can I FaceTime you? Can You? Well, I love that because when you are really struggling, you tend to close yourself off to the world. Yes. And so I love this advice 'cause energetically you can feel like you're spinning Yes.


That, am I doing anything to actually drive this forward? And you did that by just taking the action. It's like me opening up these bills and just being like, can't pay that today. Take the action. But I can call the company Yes. And explain what's going on. A hundred percent. You know, I don't have a job today, but I can call a friend and start networking about what's going on. And I just kept telling myself, I'm gonna get myself out of this. I don't know how. And these consistent actions that you took, that I took, it was the consistency and the courageous conversations that gave me more confidence. Whoever's listening or watching right now, if anything has resonated with you in any way, the best way you can be develop a, a mindset of generosity is to share this with one or two friends in your life.


Share this with your sister, your girlfriend. Share this with your mom, your brother, your spouse, and say, Hey, listen, I know things haven't been maybe horrible around money, but I'd love to improve our relationship with money together. Hmm. I'd love to start asking questions and having conversations and feeling more safe around money with you. It doesn't mean we've had a bad relationship with money together, but I wanna increase our ability to feel stronger around money so we can both create more abundance in our life financially. Is that something you're open to? If so is, share with me your biggest takeaway from this episode with Lewis and Mel and let's talk about it. Just starting here and having a conversation with one or two friends or family members is a huge step forward.

Welcome back. It's your buddy Mel Robbins. We are here today. I'm with my friend Louis Howes. I'm so excited you're spending time together with us because we are talking about the simple habits and steps that you can take to change your financial future. So Louis, what do you think the top skills are? Let's say the person listening is like, Louis, if I wanna put myself in a position in the next two years to be able to earn six, seven figures, is there a particular skill that I should be leaning into right now? The skill that I'm gonna say is leadership, but learning to lead yourself. It's not the skill that you think, which is Like, yeah, I always thought you were gonna say learn to code to ai. No, no, I'm lead myself.


No. How the hell am I gonna make six figures lo? 'cause you might. There are certain hard skills you're gonna wanna learn. For me, public speaking was one of the greatest skills that I learned. It's more of a soft skill. Leadership overall is the skill that you wanna develop. Learning to lead yourself. Learning to navigate your emotions, learning to regulate your emotions, learning to believe in yourself. All of that self-leadership and self emotional intelligence within you. And that takes reflection. That takes listening to this episode, that takes journaling, that takes having a great evening routine, a morning routine. It's leading your life to be proud of you and accepting of you. If you're not there yet, it just means great.


There's something I get to do every day to improve. Stack the wins every single day. So have a conversation with someone every single day for five minutes about money. Create a game plan in your morning routine about what three steps you're gonna take today to support you on learning something new about money. Read 10 pages in a book, Listen to This episode. Have a conversation with a friend. Start stacking the wins with where you're at in your life. And If you have a lot of money, it might look different than If you don't have a lot of money, right? But start stacking the wins so you feel the momentum of that money and you're gonna feel more confident when you have that momentum. If you just feel stuck, you don't have momentum. So in order to get mu unstuck, you have to start taking actions every single day.


And when I was 24, broke on my sister's couch, no clear game plan, I gave myself one. And it was a nine month game plan because it was like around this time, it was like March in the beginning of the year. So I was like, all right, by the end of this year I wanna have one goal accomplished from money. Hmm. And I did this, which was, I wrote down $5,000. I just thought of something for me that seems so unrealistic. Five grand at that time was like, I don't know how I'm gonna make this money. I dunno where the money's gonna come from. I have no clue, but lemme just write down a goal for myself. Five grand. And I said, how do I wanna make this money? I would like to make it from public speaking. I just got into public speaking classes at Toastmasters and I was like your cast.


I was my cast. That's your stuffing broccoli in your pockets. Exactly. And reading word for word, not looking at the audience, like sweating outta my, my, you know, cutoff shirt, smelling up the room. And I, and I literally said it would be a dream to make five grand from one speech. But it terrified me. It excited me and terrified me at the same time. So this is what I did. I wrote it down on a piece of paper and I signed it with a date that I wanted to accomplish it by. I just wanted to create a visualization practice for myself with a clear goal and a clear date in mind. Got it. Five grand date by when, how I'm gonna do it. I put it on the wall, I framed it on my bedroom right behind me on my wall. So every day I woke up, I turn around, I see the goal in mind.


So I just had a clear direction. It wasn't like what I'm gonna do in 10 years and I'm gonna be a millionaire one day. It was like, I just wanna be five grand in nine months giving a speech. I don't know how I'm gonna do it, but I'm gonna show up every single week to Toastmasters to take action and get better at the skill. Yeah. And I'm gonna start giving free workshops through LinkedIn, which I started using LinkedIn to build relationships. So I said, I'm gonna find a way to do free events, tell people I'll speak at their company. I'll do a lunch and learn whatever it is. I'll do anything for free to practice to get reps. So every week I went to public speaking class and then I was doing free workshops for those next nine months. At one point someone gave me a hundred dollars and I was like, this is incredible.


I'm rich. And I just said, okay, I need to do more of this thing. And eventually by the end, I shit you not $5,000 for one speech came to me by the end of that date. And I think the deadline created such a level of urgency for me to take action. Again. I was working hard. It doesn't mean I was like, just like I'm gonna think it and money's gonna flow to me. That's not what this is about. I was showing up weekly. I was terrified weekly. And I showed up to develop skills for myself so that my value appreciated. I love what you just said because one of the things that I got from reading your book and digging into it is that you're revealing all of the mistakes that we've made that we didn't know we were making based on our past or the stories we tell ourself or self-doubt that put obstacles between us and the money that we can create that make it feel hard and complicated.


Yes. You just need to learn the tools and have the courage to be curious to understand more. I am so in, let's jump into the tools. Okay. So there are three key steps to improving your relationship with money. And that's really the first thing that we need to understand. What is our relationship with money? The first one, really understanding your money wounds. A money wound. What is that mean? It becomes a money wound, which is a part of your money story. Okay. A money story. So When you can write down and journal, here are some of the things that happened to me when I was younger around money that caused me to feel a little anxious, a little avoidant, that make me feel stressed about money. And just write down the stories that you remember. For me, I remember stealing money.


I remember stealing candy bars at stores. I remember the shame that I felt by getting caught when I was younger, stealing money and just like, man, that was a wound. That was a trauma in my life. Yeah. I remember also, this is a really sad story. I didn't really have many friends growing up being dyslexic, similar to yourself. You probably had a lot of friends, probably missed popularity. But I was dyslexic and always in the special needs classes in school. And I remember when anytime kids would hang out with me or talk to me, I was like just holding onto it. I was like, oh, please hang out with me. And there was these two kids that wanted to start a club, an afterschool club, like in their basement, right? And they said, in order to join the club, you either need to answer a couple of questions or you need to pay money.


And I was like, well I don't have any money, so what are the questions? And I didn't know the answer to the questions and I felt like the dumbest kid in the world. And so I went home and I talked to my mom and I said, mom, I need $5 to join this club. And she was like, I don't have the money. And I go, I really need this. And she could see the desperation in my, in my heart. Hmm. And so we turn over the couch cushions and she's looking for quarters. She's going into a room, her drawers, and she, she gets together $5 and change, puts it in a shoebox. And I walk to the house where the kids are, I hand them the shoebox with $5 in it and I hang out with them for like an hour. They're talking with themselves in the basement.


And it's just me by myself. And I just feel like I'm the dumbest person in the world. I can't answer their questions. I barely had the money to just be their friends. Even when I did, I'm not their friend. It's a fake friend. And I never went back to that because I was just like, man, this doesn't feel good. So this is a money wound. These are just stories that I had these memories that still lived with me today. And I had to learn how to create a new story. Well what you write about this on page 63 of the book and you talk about how the first question was name someone who walked on the moon. Second one was name the first three presidents of the United States.


And you know, I still don't know the answers. You know, it's like I still don't know the answers to these things. You know what? And we still love you Lewis. Yeah, exactly. Most of us don't either. And you are right. Not only was I not smart enough to join the club, but I had to pay to have friends. I later came to realize that the deeper message I took away from this experience wasn't just that I didn't have much money, but that I didn't have much value. Yes. And so I can see how the story and you write down, so the first kind of struggle that people have is, Is really getting clear on what your money memories are through your money wounds. So just taking a, writing a list of like stories, memories around money wounds.


Where are the things where money was tied to maybe something your parents said and they struggled and they had arguments or they fought. Maybe you had to move schools because you couldn't afford something anymore. Maybe you had to move out of the house, whatever it might be. Maybe you had to live with your, your aunts and uncles for a season of time 'cause your parents didn't have money. Maybe kids made fun of you 'cause you were wearing something that wasn't cool, whatever it might be. Just write down the memories of your money history, your money story. Yeah. And these are some money wounds that still, If you haven't learned to heal and have a better relationship with those stories. And learn to essentially forgive yourself. Create a new relationship with yourself around that.


And just kind of hug yourself emotionally. Like, okay, this is what I went through as a kid and it sucked. But as an adult I can do things differently. Yes. And these stories don't have to define me. These wounds don't have to stay open anymore. That's Right. But, But a lot of us are unconsciously still acting out of wounds that we haven't healed. It's true. And when it's tied to money and you're an intimate relationship with your partner, your boyfriend, your girlfriend, your husband, your wife, there's even a greater charge to that emotional feeling. And it's not a feeling of freedom, it's a feeling of stress, overwhelm, chaos. So I don't know what conversations you heard from parents or peers or friends growing up around money.


Did you have, like, were your parents very conscious around money and did they have a good relationship? Did they never argue around money? Did they never stress about it? Did they teach you and empower you around money? Or did it feel like money doesn't grow on trees? Money's challenging. We're fighting because of money, conversations. We don't have enough. It's there's never enough. These bills I gotta pay. Like was that part of your story? You know, not really. It's interesting because I never heard my parents talk about money. So they were avoided. I don't know what that means, but I, I, I never heard them talk about money. They were both extremely hardworking. And I do remember my vivid, vivid memory of both my grandmother on the big cattle farm that my mom grew up in.


She would sit in her house code at the end of the day with one of those little tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap like calculator things. And she would be balancing the cash receipts from the farm, roadside farm stand. And then when I grew up, my mom would literally be tallying and paying bills and balancing the checkbook. And that's the only conversation that I ever heard about money. Now my husband on the other hand, grew up with a family that there was a lot of shame around money. Mm. Like his dad started to ascend in his career when Chris was in high school. But there was a lot of, don't get used to this, this isn't yours. You don't deserve that. You know, you need to pay your own way.


Like even though there was money. And so my husband was very, very is, well not anymore, he is changed his story around money. But very tense, very restrictive. A lot of, I don't deserve this. So Louis, how does improving your money story help you? When you feel lost, It helps you because when you heal your relationship with money, then you can feel free with money. And If you feel stuck and trapped and anxious or avoidance or overwhelmed with money, you're not free. And it's hard to create from a place of scarcity. It's hard to just experience joy and love and passion and fun in your life from a place of scarcity.


It's really challenging. So why would you think that having that same energy with money is going to create more financial freedom for you? Let me see if I can like unpack, because I think I know what you're saying and so I wanna make sure as you're listening to Louis, and maybe you're the 23-year-old who's scared, you're never gonna be able to move outta your parents' house or ever afford a house of your own. Or maybe you're like, my husband and I were, and you're now in a situation where you thought you'd be further along and you're now just paycheck to paycheck. When you say free, I think I know what you mean. What I can recognize in that word, if I go the opposite.


So if freedom is one extreme that's available, if I change my story about money, the opposite of that is imprisoned. If you're imprisoned by your debt like I used to be, yes. And you're also keeping yourself trapped there with the story you tell yourself By criticizing yourself, and I'm an idiot. How could I let myself do this? Why could I let myself get in debt? But You there with me? How do you, how do you know? That's what I was saying, Louis. But I mean, that's how a lot of people feel. And that's how I felt at that time. I was like, why didn't I just try harder in school? Why didn't I go get that medical degree? Why didn't I do something that was safe? Why did I try to pursue this crazy dream of playing football? Yes, I got injured and now I have nothing. It's like this guilt, shame, energy that only keeps you trapped.


It doesn't create a space of flourishing, of growth and abundance. It keeps you stagnant, stuck and feeling not enough. It's going back to this word of peace. Most people have a lack of peace when it comes to money. They feel Stressed. Oh, isn't that true? Well, and And also like, If you can't pay your bills, You're stressed. Of course there is no peace. There is no peace. There is no peace. And I'm not saying like, oh, you're broke and you're in chaos mode right now. Just feel peace. That's really hard to do. It's first step is understanding your story. This feels like a great moment to hit the pause button Lewis, and give our sponsors a chance to share a few words. And I also wanna give you a chance to share this episode with people that you care about, people that deserve to have a great financial future And that need to be reminded of the simple things they can be doing now to change the trajectory of their life and the amount of money that they make.


So don't go anywhere. We got more to share with you when we return. And Louis and I are gonna be waiting for you after a short break.

Welcome back. It's your buddy Mel Robbins. Thank you for still being here. Thank you for spending time listening to this. I'm so excited that my buddy Lewis house is here And that we are talking all things money. So Lewis, what's the second step? Once You know your story, the second one is to reset your money mindset. What do you mean money mindset? This sounds weird. We need to reset and rewire our brains to have the ability so that more money can come to us effortlessly and easily, even though we're going to be working and taking actions to get there on a consistent basis. But we need to rewire our brains to allow for money to come to us. Okay, So how do I get a better mindset?


You start educating yourself. Okay. You start educating yourself, you start getting mentors, you start learning about it, and you start having conversations around money where you can feel comfortable as opposed to scared. Okay? Again, most people feel afraid of just having a conversation about it. I agree. I agree. They Don't, they won't speak to their parents about it. Their parents are hush hushed. They don't talk about it. You don't talk to your partner about it. It's just confusing and scary. And so you have to rewire your mind to think about Money. So isn, is it actually possible? 'cause here's, here's the thing. You've rewired your mind. Yes, I certainly have. It's A constant work in Progress. Okay. But I've, I've clawed my way out that yes, people are like, how'd you get at it? I'm like, 15 years. Yeah. Hard work showing up Of hard Work, showing up.


And it's not, it's not getting rid of hard work. No one can say that you don't work hard, that I don't work hard. We work hard, but it's about the energy around money. How can we make that feel easier when we receive it and when we give it away, it's shifting the energy and the relationship with those things so that you feel more free. You know, I get a lot out of that because when I think back to like it was in my freaking forties, I was supposed to feel like I'm on the uptick now. And so I felt all the regret and the beat down, none of which helped me to climb out of the debt. What helped me to climb outta debt was to get serious that I actually wanted to.


And so I think it's really important for you to understand it's not gonna be easy. It's not easy to open up your bills. It's not easy to look at your bank account and see where the money is going. It's not easy to recognize that you're paying for apps and you're paying for subscriptions and you're paying for things that you don't use And that you gotta tighten up the belt. But when you get very clear that you value something different than where you are, I have no doubt in my mind that no matter how old you are or how young you are and in the hole you are with student debts, that you can start to chip away at this. Yes. And the chipping away at this, even though it's not a glamorous thing to do, that is what actually changes how you feel.


And that is what changes your money and your financial life over time. And it takes time. And I'm gonna be honest about that. But that doesn't change the fact that you could actually make a decision today to use the advice that you're learning and just dig in 100%. And look, it just started with opening of the bills, which I had been avoiding doing. It started with calling the credit card companies. It started with printing out my actual monthly bank statement and highlighting all the dumb ways I was spending money. It started with looking at, you know, the savings that I did have. It started with having conversations with family members about where we actually were.


It started with really questioning, can we afford to hold onto this house? Can we afford to have this car? Can we afford to be a Netflix subscriber? I mean, that's the level of honesty you have to get to because I think, you know, you look a lot at like how much you earn and you forget to look at, well, how much is actually going out the door? And you're not even looking at it because you're telling yourself you're bad with money and you feel demoralized about the price of everything. Well look at where your money is going and then get very clear about what you want to create. And then for me, what that meant is get a job and then get a second one and then figure out how to make money on the side.


And it's not easy, but with time. And for me, it took a decade, you can actually change what things look like. You can 100% a strategy that I've learned over the years is when money comes to me, I thank money. If you don't have that feeling, I mean, I'm grateful that you're here. I'm grateful that money just came to me. Again, it's tying it to the mindset, which is a generous spirit. And when you have a generous heart, you have a thankful heart. Hmm. So I'm thanking money when it comes and when it goes. This is the hard thing. You have to thank it when it goes. Why most people don't like spending money on their bills. Or for me, this is one of the hardest things I've had to learn, spending money on taxes. And for years I freaking hated it.


I hated it. I hated it. And that energy kept me trapped. Hmm. It kept me stressed out and trapped. It doesn't mean I have to love it and and enjoy it, but I have to shift my relationship with spending money on bills, spending money on taxes, spending the money on things that you don't feel like you wanna spend on Just shifting that small thing. When you send the check to the student loan, you're just like, thank you. I'm proud of myself. Yeah. That I can afford to do this. Yes. I'm grateful that I have an education. I, I'm one step closer to being financially out of debt. Yes. It's like it's repeating these things every time. Like when you're paying for your, your cell phone bill or whatever, it's like, thank you for giving me an ability to communicate with the world.


Thank you for the ability to be able to call my mom. Thank for the ability to call my best friend when she's struggling. It's when we create more of an emotional appreciation around these things. We can then feel emotionally safe around money and have conversations in a unique way. I get emotional thinking about that because I'm like just being able to call my mom on FaceTime. I don't see my family that often, but my cell phone bill, I don't know, it's probably a few hundred dollars a month that I pay automatically. And if I was paying it by itself and writing a check, I would say, thank you for giving me the ability to connect with the people I love the most. Hmm. And looking at it that way as opposed to, ah, this is fricking another cell phone bill.


Oh, they guarded me on these fees. Like, oh man, I'm getting screwed here. It's like the energy is not good. And so it's learning how to shift outta that stressful energy into more of a healthy, peaceful energy. Well, and what else is cool is you're clearly in control when you do that. You're in control. Yeah. You may not like it or love that you're paying these bills or paying off this debt, paying debt, taxes, debt. It's not, no, it's not enjoyable. No. But I, but I have shifted the last, I'm proud of the fact that I can write the check. Yeah. So is there a statement or a mantra or something that you would recommend based on all the research that you've done, the people that you've spoken to, that if somebody doesn't even know how to reset their mindset, here's something you could adopt and just start saying to yourself, I would say money is good.


Money is my friend. Oh, money comes to me effortlessly. I just, oh God. But what if you're like, but it doesn't, but it doesn't. Louis money Is good. You have to start, you have to start training yourself. Money is good. Money is my friend. I'm not afraid of money. I feel safe with money. And you're gonna be saying things that aren't true to start with. Yeah, you're not gonna feel these things, But you need to reinforce these things with your behaviors on a daily basis. It took me years to have money conversations where I felt more comfortable talking about money. Years. I was not comfortable asking questions and talking about it and talking about how much I make, how much I spend, how much debt I have. It didn't feel good. But the more I practiced, the more I did it on a consistent basis, the more I felt safe around my money situation.


So what's the third step? And the Third one is really about getting clear on your meaningful money mission. What is a meaningful money mission? There's Different seasons of life. Some seasons we just need to make money to pay the bills. But the goal is to get clear on your meaningful money mission. Because if you're just making money to make money, it still stresses you out. If there's not a clear goal in mind that is bigger than making money, Hmm. How is this money gonna serve you? How's it gonna serve your family? And how am I going to be generous with this in the future? Even If you can't think about being generous with your money now start planning. What will I do with this money that can help others around me? Is it my friends?


Is it my family? Is it a charity that I love? Is it my community? Is it the school? Is it the church? How am I going to use this for good that'll attach more meaning to your money mission? So when I was getting started, my money mission was to get outta college debt, was to get off my sister's couch, was to be able to pay for my own rent, make my own money so I could pay for whatever I needed to. People have a lack of clarity on what they want, why they want it, and where the money's gonna go. It's so true. And especially right now, I see this like epidemic Mm. Of people seeing things on social media. And the mission is get get, get, get, get, get, get Spend and look Better.


And yeah, spend, spend look better. And what you're talking about is If you don't have a powerful enough, why a hundred Percent and a Game plan spends tied to values. Yes. And then some sort of plan for what you wanna achieve and why, then you're gonna be rudderless. Yeah. Or you're just gonna be back in the place of like, okay, I got this money, I spent it and now what do I do? I need to go make more money for what? So just getting clear on your, your money mission. For me, I was very clear and I defined it early on, I want to impact and inspire a hundred million lives every single week to improve the quality of their life. So it just became a clear mission, which also allowed me to say no to money that I didn't want. And most people say yes to any money that comes their way.


And I say no to a lot of different things that don't align with the mission. So for instance, I don't have alcohol sponsors, gambling sponsors, porn sponsors, whatever it is, they just don't align with me and my mission. So you have to know when to say no to money that isn't meant for you as well. And say yes to the money that is meant for you and your meaningful money mission. Would You talk to the like a 20-year-old that's listening? How do you create a money mission? Because for me, when Chris and I were really, really struggling financially, my mission became safety. Yes, I want to be able to pay my bills. I was not thinking about beach houses or millions of dollars in the bank.


It literally was, I want to feel like I can fall asleep at night and know that I can pay my bills a Hundred percent. So there's a pendulum on this and I call it the priority pendulum. And on one side it's kind of chasing your passion. Like, I'm really excited about this. Thing's gonna go all in on it. But most people, if they're lucky, they can make money with their passion. It's hard sometimes. And it might take years to develop skills and tools and resources and networking to be able to make money full time with your passion. Then the other side is like, okay, I'm just gonna go the practical route and I'm just gonna get any job I can get. But there's zero fun. It's miserable, it sucks the life outta me. It's like I'm drained every day when I go home from work.


But I'll tell you, when I couldn't pay my bills, that first freaking job I got, it was the best damn job it ever had because was was aligned with my mission of I gotta pay bills a hundred Percent. And so there's a season for that as well. Okay. Like you're not gonna stay in that for 20 years if it's sucking the life outta you or you gotta learn How to Make It fun. The goal is to get more towards the middle, which is kind of the, the meaningful mission area around money as opposed to just being practical. And there was a time where I drove trucks. I was making $250 a week driving a truck six hours a day. I needed to make money. I had to do what it take to make some money. So I was in that season of more practicality and I made the most of it, but I didn't enjoy it. Now I wanted to go play football, but I couldn't play football at that time.


That was the passion. So I eventually got into more of the meaningful mission area of this, which is figuring out how can I align my passion with making money the best way possible and start working towards that more and more. Again, you are a lawyer and you turned it into, but I'm also a really good communicator. I love inspiring people. I love empowering people. And over time you eventually learned how to bring that into where you are now. And when you can do that, that's a beautiful thing. But that took years and steps to happen. So that's part of the mission side of things. You know what's interesting is that I can see how, particularly If you take the struggle around not having a money mission. And so let's just say you're in your twenties, or let's say if You're not clear at all, you're screwed.


Yes. Correct. You're screwed. 'cause you're like, what's the point of making it? I don't know. And I'm just trying, I gotta keep it, I don't know. Wanna get in debt. Yes. You're Stressed. So having a true mission is giving yourself the time and space to say, this is what I want my life to look like. And it Can simply be, how much do I wanna make this year? It can just be a goal. It doesn't have to be like this mission for the rest of your life, but it can just be like, okay, for the next three months, I'm gonna take on this job to help me get out of this debt. That can be your mission for right now. It doesn't have to be figuring out your money mission forever. Right now I'm going to read a book about money. I'm going to talk to a financial advisor. I'm going to ask my parents about money and I'm just gonna learn a little bit in the next few months.


That's my mission. It doesn't have to be I'm gonna figure out how to get outta debt forever. It's just give yourself a map and a game plan that you can take actions and every single day to support you feeling more clear and safe around money. You know what I love is I think that it feels attainable. And dare I say exciting to give yourself a three month money mission. Like just, it's huge. Write it out for yourself. What are you, what is your mission around money in the next three months? Yes. Is it to learn more? Is it to spend less? Is it to pay off one credit card? Is it to learn how to cook so that you're not spending your money going out? Exactly. Like a, a mission that gives you a purpose.


And then If you also combine that Lewis with the things you just said, where every day you're like, I have a good relationship with money. I'm learning about money. Yeah. You start to say things positive, tied to that mission. Or I'm taking actions to mend my relationship with money. You know, I'm taking actions daily. I'm having conscious conversations to mend and heal my relationship with money. Well, just one shift that you could make If you truly want to change your relationship with money is notice the input on social media and notice where you spend your time. How much Time are you on there? Yeah. Are you, are you watching content or listening to content that makes you wanna spend money you don't have?


Or are you actually listening and watching content that teaches you how to become better with money? A hundred percent. That educates you. You start educating yourself. You start getting mentors. You start, If you're missing mentors. The School of Greatness is an extraordinary podcast. It's been around for more than a decade. I think you celebrated 12 years, your 12th year anniversary this year. And some of the most successful episodes that you have done in those 12 years are with financial experts. Yes. With billionaires. Yes. With people that are wildly successful. You know, one other thing I'm gonna say is we've all had that friend who all of a sudden drops out of the social scene and then you see them six months to a year from now and they're completely ripped.


Different human being, different human being. They've been training for a marathon, they've made this decision, I'm just out of the party scene. I'm gonna get serious about my health. Yeah. And you're like, what happened? And in that instance, you know, they got sick and tired of where they were. Yes. They said, this isn't working anymore. I have to change my story about myself and I need to wake up every day and kind of align my actions and my time with this mission. And I think we see it with health, but it's the exact same thing with money. I've lost so many friends over the years that really hurt me early on. 'cause I didn't understand why.


But it became clear that if your friends or your friend circle, If you wanna make different changes based on your friend circle's current situation, and you go six months like a ghost, and you just kind of focus on your goals, you take action. You never go out and you really overcome, whether it be financially or physically or whatever it might be, people aren't gonna necessarily like that or appreciate it when they see you come back in six months or a year of you changing your habits and changing your mindset because you're killing off the person they once knew. Hmm. And they don't like feeling like, oh, you're doing something different. You're used to going out on the weekends. You're used to going out and drinking a beer after, after work on Fridays, whatever it might be. And when you want to change your vision and change your map and change your mission towards something new, you're gonna have to make sacrifices.


And people don't like that. They really don't Let them, Let them let them. Someone wrote a great book that helps you overcome the fear of worrying about what people think about you. 'cause that's one of the greatest things that holds people back, is when you're worried about what your friends or family or online community's gotta think about you when you change. Well, isn't that also why we spend a lot of money we don't have? Because we want people to think a certain thing about us. Yes. Yes. So Louis, I wanna ask you the question that you ask all your podcast guests. You've asked me. Oh man. Now I'm gonna ask you, I have to reflect on this. Imagine it's your last day on earth. Yep. Many, many, many years from now.


You've accomplished everything you've ever dreamed of, of. But for whatever reason, you sold your library of content. So you have no access to it. It's all been taken down by the person that purchased it. Right. But you get to leave behind three truths, three lessons that you want to leave with the world. What would those three things be? I've asked this so many times, I have to reflect on my, my answers now. The first one would be the greatest priority you should have is taking care of your health physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Because If you don't have a healthy life, it's hard to really create the life of your dreams.


Hmm. The second thing would be to live in gratitude every single day for the good, the challenging, the ups and downs. Because gratitude is the gateway to love and abundance. The third thing I would say is to pursue your dreams and the calling in your heart with all your strength until that calling goes away. Never give up on your dreams and make sure you leave it all on the playing field. What are your parting words, Louis? It's interesting. You know, I'm, I'll be 42 next month and I was having a conversation with my wife, Martha last night before I went to bed, just thinking how blessed I am, how blessed I am that she's in my life, how blessed I am that I did so much work to to heal so that I could receive love and feel I'm worthy of love.


And I just truly believe that when we can take care of our heart, we can heal. We can mend the pain from our past in any way possible. To know that we are love, know that we are lovable, that we are worthy and deserving of love. Just everything in my life has changed since then. And it's been a beautiful gift and blessing in my life to be in a peaceful, harmonious relationship when most of my life, life felt like chaos inside. Hmm. And one of the reasons why I wanted to do this book is 'cause I didn't want people to stress.


'cause a lot of people were just feeling stress and overwhelmed and anxiety from everything in life. Relationships was one of the big stressors for me. Intimacy. And I just wanna leave people with the the knowing I am certain and know that you are lovable and you are deserving of love. And I don't want your past wounds. I don't want your money struggles to get in the way of you knowing that. And that would be the thing that I would leave with people is trust that you will figure it out. If you're willing to do the work, don't try to do the work on your own.


I had lots of mentors, therapists, guides, friends who supported me over the years, but I reached out to them constantly. I sought the the advice and the help. I didn't just say, ah, no one's helping me. And I want people to know that they're loved, that they're worthy And that they matter. You know what I love about what you just said, Louis, is that at the end of the day, it's really just about empowering yourself to live a great life. And I just wanna thank you for everything that you shared today, because taking control of your financial future and telling yourself a different story and creating different beliefs and taking the steps that lead to a different future that helps you build a great life.
