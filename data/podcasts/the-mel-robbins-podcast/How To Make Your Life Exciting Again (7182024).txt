Hey, it's your friend Mel and welcome to The Mel. Robbins Podcast. You're not gonna believe what I did last night. I mean, just take a guess. What do you think I did last night? You're never gonna guess this one. Well, last night my husband Chris And I pitched a tent in our backyard. We grabbed a blowup mattress, a couple of comforters, two pillows, and we slept out under the stars in our backyard here in Vermont. It was a full moon. It was absolutely incredible.

0:
And we used to do this kind of stuff all the time when we were first dating. I mean, we were constantly planning fun adventures and camping and like doing cool things outside. And you know, we've been married now, my God, it's gonna be 28 years this year. Holy smokes. And the other day Chris turned to me and said, Hey Mel, you know, in a couple nights it's gonna be a full moon. Weather looks good. Do you have any interest in sleeping outside in a tent? I was like, oh my God, yes. And so we did In fact. We did it last night. And here I was this morning after sleeping in the tent last night, I was having my coffee in the house. And if you're watching, you can probably tell based on the fact that I have greasy hair, I've pulled it back in a ponytail and I'm wearing my red flannel that I look like I was camping because I was.

0:
But here I am, you know, we're out of the tent. I'm standing in my kitchen. I got my mug of coffee in my hand. And I started to wonder, that was so fun. When did life get boring? Why don't I do this more often? And then it dawned on me, Mel, maybe life isn't boring. Maybe you've gotten boring. I want you to really think about that. Maybe the reason why you're not having enough fun in your life or your relationship or work is because you've gotten a little too used to your routine and that's made you a little boring. Well, today, that's what you And. I are gonna talk about with a neuroscientist from MIT and University College London, who says, habits and routines have a hidden cost.

0:

There are really fun ways that you can shake up your life, your work, your relationships, and even a really fun thing that research says you need to do to shake up your vacation.

Hey, it's your friend Mel. I am so glad you're here with me today. It is always such an honor to spend some time together, And I. Wanna start by acknowledging you for taking the time to listen to something that is gonna help you create a better life. And I know our conversation today is gonna do that. If you're a new listener, welcome to the Mel Robbins Podcast family. I'm so happy you're here with me. I love the topic that we're gonna talk about, And I am a little groggy because yes, I did sleep in a tent last night. And I was telling you my husband Chris And I when we were first like dating. And then we eventually got married and we had kids. And when they were young, we used to go camping all the time.

0:
And not only like to the national parks and out into the wilderness, but we would pitch a tent in the backyard when our kids were little. Like just on any given night, especially during those years when we didn't have a money to go away and take a trip. And just a couple days ago, you know, we're standing in the kitchen, we're cooking dinner, Chris And I have been married for 28 years. We've been together for a long time. And Chris turns to me outta the blue and he is like, Hey Mel, you wanna sleep outside? And just that one change to our normal routine created so much excitement and fun. I felt like I was dating him again.

0:
And you know, to put this in perspective, it's not like I'm in the wilderness. I mean, we pitched the tent like eight feet from our bedroom for crying out loud. Like you could almost reach out and touch the house. If I had to get up and go to the bathroom during the night, I would've just walked into my house. But I felt a world away because just think about what, what do you do on a normal night after work or school? Same old, same old, right? You, you cook dinner, you clean up, you watch something on TV, or you read a book, you go to bed boring instead, one small change, just eight feet from the outside of my house, whole new world, whole new marriage.

0:
What small change? You know, And I was thinking this morning that you And I talk a lot about the topic of locking in a routine or you know, learning new habits and making 'em stick. And that's a really important topic when you wanna change and learn something new. But today we're gonna talk about something different, which is what do you do when you need to change a life? You don't wanna blow it up, you just wanna mix it up. You know what I mean? A life or work or a relationship that's become just too routine. It's a little boring. And when that happens, you gotta do the opposite. You have to become really intentional about breaking the routine, about shaking things up.

0:
Not in a way that breaks everything apart, but that makes them better. Like think about a snow globe, right? You pick up a snow globe and you shake it and all of a sudden all of that stuff that was inside like gets just covered in all this shimmery little stuff. And then all the shimmery little stuff, that little shake, it eventually just like drifts down to the bottom and the image appears and things go back to normal. That's exactly what I'm talking about. How to add that little shake into your life, into your relationship, into your work. And I know you've experienced what I'm talking about when I say that things are a little boring.

0:
That life like nothing's really bad, it just feels a little dull. You know, like the only thing that you have to look forward to is, oh my gosh, is there's some surprise movie that's streaming tonight or that vacation that you can afford to take eight months from now. Like that's not a way to go through your life. So today we're gonna shake things up and we're gonna shake it up in a really cool way because this is not just some light chit chatty topic. There's a word that researchers have to describe this feeling when life gets a little dull, when things seem a little too boring, that feeling that the person that you're in a relationship with has lost their luster.

0:
It's this feeling that, I hate to say it, but you're kind of falling outta love with a life that you used to love. You might be silently quitting your job. The word to describe when life becomes too routine is habitation. And habitation affects everything and it affects your enjoyment of every single aspect of your life. And habituation is the phenomenon of how when you get used to something, you tend not to enjoy it as much. Whether that's your significant other or even have you ever noticed the first day of vacation is always the best.

0:
And then you start to get used to being away and it's just not as fun as it was on the first day or the first bite of ice cream. Way better than the rest of the cone. I mean, that doesn't keep me from eating the entire thing. But the question is how can you enjoy the whole thing? How can you shake up your day to day life or your relationship or your work so you enjoy it more? And there's a lot of research about why this is important and so many fun and simple things that you're gonna learn to do today that will make the little and the big things in your life shimmer again. And what I love about this topic, it's one of my favorite kinds of topics, Because. it combines deep academic research with the tiny little things you can do that make a profound difference on your experience as you live your day to day life.

0:
And here with the groundbreaking science and the research to teach you how you can start seeing, feeling and noticing all the shimmery cool things in your life, again, is Dr. Tali Sharot. Now Dr. Sheret is a behavioral neuroscientist and the director of the effective Brain Lab at University College London. Her research integrates neuroscience, behavioral economics and psychology to study how emotion and behavior influences people's beliefs and decisions. She's also a professor at both University College, London and MIT and the bestselling author of three books, including the new book Look Again. And this episode, I think you're gonna love it because it's one of those profound conversations that will allow you to truly understand and connect the dots between why you've become bored with what used to give you excitement and meaning, and more importantly, based on the research, how you can reignite the sparks of joy and happiness in your day to day life.

0:
Dr. Tali Shett, welcome to the Mel Robbins Podcast. I am so excited to shake things up with you. I am

2:
So excited to be here. Thanks for having me.

0:
What I'd love to do is dig into your really amazing research on habitation. You have uncovered this link between change and experiencing happiness and joy in your life. And so many of us fear change. And yet what you are finding is that our ability to change and pushing ourselves to change and experiencing new things in our life is foundational to you enjoying your life and having moments of joy. So can you tell us about habituation? Right.

2:
So habitation, it's really a a fundamental process. Our fundamental rule that governs how our brain works and every neuro in it. And it's basically our tendency to respond less and less and less to things that are constant or that change very gradually or are frequent. So for example, an easy example, you walk into a bakery, there's like the smell of the baked goods and the cake. And studies show that within 20 minutes you cannot detect the smell any longer. The olfactory neuros in your brain stop responding because the smell is constant around you, right? So very fast they will actually stop and you won't be able to smell it. You probably have this with with perfume, right? When you first buy perfume and you put it on, it's really salient next day a little bit less for a little bit less a month goes by and you can't smell your own perfume.

2:
It's

0:
So true.

2:
Yeah. So that's habit situation. Or you jump into a pool, it's really cold, but you tend to get used to it. After a few minutes it's less cold, right? And so just as you habituate to smells or to a temperature, you also habituate to more complicated things in your life or in society. So for example, you get used to, there's a new romance, right? It's really exciting, but over time it gets lit less exciting, right? So you have less of a reaction, right? Less of a physiological reaction, less of an emotional reaction, but you also get used to the bad stuff breakup, right? There's less of a reaction to that. You get used to the view of the ocean and you get used to pollution too, meaning you less, you're able to detect it less, you're able to see it even less.

2:
You get used to a new job, to a promotion, you react to that yet less you habituate to that. You can habituate also to losing a job. And so because of habitation, we might have some great things in our life like a loving relationship or a comfortable home or interesting job, but they don't elicit as much joy on a daily basis as you'd expect them to

0:
Just because you're used to it, right?

2:
Right. You don't notice them anymore, right? Like you could have a wonderful comfortable home, which when you first bought it, you were so excited and you kind of like really kind of noticed everything. But now you're there every day, right? So it doesn't elicit as much of a reaction. the Same thing with a job when you first got the job, you're like, oh, you're just amazed that you could do what you could do. Yeah. But now you're doing it every day, you're doing it right? So it has less, it doesn't mean the people don't appreciate it all, but less so over time. And it's a similar thing for the bad stuff in life. So there could be bad things around us, societal things like sexism or racism or could be cracks in your personal relationships or inefficiencies in the workplace.

2:
But if they've been there for a long time, we stop noticing them. We just kind of get used to them and we stop. And if we stop noticing them, we're less motivated to change.

0:
So how does this impact our happiness? Because, it seems like it could have good and bad implications. And, I. Think it's really interesting that your brain itself is reacting to something that you are getting used to. So it's not like you're some sort of jerk that's just zoning out. It's that your brain in your words, this is habituation, right? That you're becoming really familiar with your partner or with where you work or your neighborhood. So how does this impact our happiness? Well,

2:
It means that the good things around us can create less happiness, right? On a daily basis. So the stuff that's really good and everyone has some good, you know, stuff around us, again, it could be a relationship, it could be a comfortable home. But those things don't elicit as much happiness. So that has a negative impact on a happiness, okay? Right? However, you know, on the flip side, if something bad happens, even if it's really, really bad, a loss of a loved one, you know, we habituate to that as well to the bad stuff in life we habituate and it could be a good thing 'cause we don't want to feel like a breakup, right?

2:
We don't want to feel that pain that you feel at the very beginning. You want to habituate, right? So then you can move forward. So that's good, right?

0:
That's very good.

2:
But on the other hand, there could be some bad things that have been there for a long time and they're kind of like in the background. And because of habituation, we don't really notice them. And that's not great because then we are not motivated to change. And it, you know, it turns out If, you do notice and you try to change and you're successful. Well that will enhance your wellbeing and your happiness. Well

0:
I think that's what the thing that's super cool about your research is that there is a direct connection between the happiness and joy that you feel and the amount that you're willing to change. And what is happening in your brain when you experience something new,

2:
Right? So really, you know, our brain, you can think about it as a front page of a newspaper. It cares about what's new, okay? What just happened? It doesn't really care that much about the old and it makes sense. You know, If, you think about it like in an evolution kind of way. And in, you know, your ability to adapt when something new is happening, your brain needs to process. 'cause maybe you need to react, right? Maybe it's like threatening, but after you know it's been there for a while and you're fine. Well we really need to keep our resources, you know, the neurons need to be ready for the next new thing that's coming. So we're ready to react to that. And so new is what we are noticing the most and what we're acting to the most.

2:
And just to give you kind of like a fun example, yeah, I was working with a tourism company where they wanted to know what makes people happiest on vacation and when they're happiest on vacation. So we went to the resorts and we surveyed people and we asked them, Hey, what was the best bit of the vacation? And there was one words that they repeated more than any other word. And it was first, the first view of the ocean. The first cocktail that I had, the first sun castle that I built, right? The first was new and exciting. Now the second view of the ocean, that was good too, but it wasn't quite as good as the first right? And the second cocktail was quite good, but it wasn't good as the first cocktail. And that's because of habituation, right?

2:
We feel less. And the other interesting thing was when we just looked at the data and we wanted to see when were they the happiest, we found that they were happiest 43 hours into a vacation. So 43 hours gave you time to unpack and really focus on the fun. But from that point on, fun started dwindling right over time. 'cause we habituated you were still happy on day 8, 7, 6, and five, but not as happy as you were. 43 hours in, right? Because you have started to habituate to the environment, to the activities.

Welcome back. It's your friend Mel. And we are here with the remarkable neuroscientist, Dr. Tali Sharot. So how do we apply this research around vacations to our own life?

2:
So I think it suggests that maybe we wanna have more frequent vacations, but shorter ones, right? So instead of going away for a couple of weeks, you might actually go for a long weekend a few times. Now sometimes it's not possible if you're going far, but what that means is you'll have more of those 40 free hour peaks, you will have more of those firsts. And you know what else you will have, you will have the anticipation of the vacation. 'cause this is what I didn't tell you, I told you that the happiest time is 43 hours into the vacation. Yeah, but I didn't actually tell you that the really, really happiest time Yeah. Is a day before vacation. Oh. So there is a study that was conducted where people who were about to go on vacation were asked every day of the week before vacation how happy they were every day of the vacation for a week, how happy they were.

2:
And then every day of vaca of the, when they came back after vacation, how happy they were. And it turns out that people are happiest before they even step on the plane. So the day before vacation, they're still in their office working on their computers, but in their mind they're on vacation. And in their mind it's quite wonderful when they go on vacation it's good, but it's not as good as it was in their mind the day before. The anticipation of good things is what really makes people happy. So if you have more vacations, you have more of those anticipations and you have more of the afterglow as well.

0:
Well you know what, there's huge implications if you take this even out of the context of vacations and you just say, what are things that I look forward to? Right? Whether, it's a date on the calendar eight months from now where I'm gonna get together with my favorite family members. Or it is some day that I'm taking off of work to take a class. Or it is some cool thing. Like I'm going, it sounds kind of dumb, but I'm going on a a walk this weekend with my husband and it is a guided walk looking for owls. This must mean I'm in my fifties, but I am so excited for this thing.

0:
And so I can see how even just being proactive about putting things in your calendar out in the future to look forward to is a way to hack happiness in your life. Now.

2:
Absolutely. I call these anticipatory events, right? These are events that we have on our calendar. They haven't happened yet, but they're making you happy at the moment. And In fact, this is why when you ask people about which days, which is a favorite day of the week, people prefer Friday by far more than Sunday because Friday brings with this the anticipation of everything that they had planned for the weekend. Whether, it is, you know, a hike to, to find owls or whatever it is, right? But Sunday you might be out hiking and looking for owls, but you have the anxiety of the work week. So Indeed anticipation is something that's really, really important.

2:
And so have that holiday booked, have that activity booked. It can be, you know, a night out, it could be a hike. Very simple things, right? And that makes us happy at the moment.

0:
What's so interesting about this research that I really like is that you got no choice in this. Like your brain is literally filing away information based on your familiarity with it. And so what is the implication for your relationship? Because as I'm sitting here listening to you talk about the research on vacation, which I think we can all relate to, I'm also thinking, oh well probably right around day 43 or week 43, as you're dating somebody and you're wondering why is this person no longer being proactive? Why is this person no longer seeming to make an effort? Why is this no longer feeling as exciting?

0:
Is that habituation? Yeah.

2:
So habituation has a lot to do with this, right? And In fact. So If, you listen to Esther Perel, you know the well-known relationship expert, she did surveys and research where she asked people, Hey, when were you most attracted to your partner? These are people who have been together for a while, Mary Apples. And she found that they said two things, either they said I was more most attracted to my partner when I went away and came back. Maybe I was like on a business trip, I was away for a weekend. And. I came back. Right? Which makes perfect sense because what you're doing when you're leaving a situation and then coming in back is you're disha habituating. What does dis habituating mean?

2:
It means that you remove that thing, right? You, you stepped out of the bakery for 10 minutes, now you're coming back. Now your neurons are gonna start responding maybe not as as much as a very, very first that when you enter the bakery, but if there's an a large enough break, then you dis habituate and you start responding. Right? And that's the first thing she found. We have actually, so on the cover of our book, if you open it up, there's a little visual illusion, which is colors, clouds of colors, and a fixation point in the middle, right? And if you fixate on that fixation point and you don't move your eyes at all, what happens is the colors suddenly become gray.

2:
And if you do it really, really well, actually it just becomes white. And why does that happen? Because the input to every specific neuron, if you're not moving your eyes, doesn't change. It's the Same, right? the Same colors are getting to the Same, exact neurons. And so the neurons at the beginning, they're like active, they're like color, color, color. But they're like, well color's not changing. I'm gonna stop responding. So now it's gray and finally it's white. All you need to do is move your eyes like that, just move them for a second and then the color immediately comes back because now different neurons are getting different signals and now they're reacting again. So that's this habituation, right? Gotcha. The habituation is what came at the beginning and then this habituation.

2:
And so that kind of same principle of course like the, the actual neural mechanism is not exactly the Same, but the principle is the Same. Your partner has been there for a while, everything's the Same. We, we kind of like don't notice, don't respond, don't think we leave for a bit. We come back and now colors. Right? So that's the first thing she found. And the second thing is related, which she found that people say they're most attracted to the partner when they're in a novel new situation. For example, the partner is talking to some strangers or the partner is on the stage doing something right. And again, this is a form of dis habituation. You're seeing a partner in a different way because they are in a different circumstance.

2:
So now it's not the Same old same olds, right? Yeah. It's something new.

0:
When does habituation pose the biggest, I think threat to upsetting what might be like otherwise like a nice life? Because I could see how you getting used to your neighborhood, you getting used to your, I'll just take the example of a kitchen. Like your kitchen's perfectly fine and yet you probably spend a lot of time on social media looking at kitchens and thinking about a kitchen renovation. And then you walk into another person's house and you're like, Ooh, we should have a coffee bar. We should do what if I did white cabinets? And now all of a sudden you're looking at your kitchen which has been perfectly fine and you no longer like it, you kind of hate it. And so does habitation make you start to reject or not like the things in your life from relationships to your job, to your neighborhood, to your kitchen?

0:
Is that part of the problem with this If, you don't realize it's going on.

2:
Yeah. Because it brings you less joy and as a result you want something different, right? And, I think your example is great because there's two things here. One is it's something that you had before which you fought was fantastic. Yes. The kitchen you fought was fantastic before, but now is not that exciting, not that fun. Right? And also the other thing that nice that you said is like, well I go to another person's house, I think their kitchen is great and they probably come to yours and for them you they think like, oh the kitchen is great. Or they think like, oh she has like a wonderful life. She has like, and it's potentially the case that you have the Same thing, right? But you've had it the Same for a while. Yes.

2:
And that's why kind of we're looking for, you know, diversity or new things and it's not all badge, right? I mean, again, it's like two sides of the coin. Okay, maybe we don't need to like redo our kitchen every couple of years, but you know, that kind of need to progress, right? Right. That's not necessarily just a bad thing, right? That mean that keeps us moving forward.

0:
Yes.

2:
But it's like a delicate balance,

0:
Right? How do you, how do you balance it? Because I can think about an example where, you know, we all are chasing the next greatest thing, right? We're chasing something that looks better or something that's gonna be this and we're kind of going after that newness thrill. And it's very clear that there's both the need to change, but there's also the fact that constantly chasing it and using an example of what, oh well they're their, their significant other does a lot of that and my partner doesn't do that anymore. Is it making us unhappy to constantly seek the change? Or how do you balance it?

2:
Yeah, so I mean it is definitely a balance, which is why I think it's important to kind of think about how do we get some joy back from what we have? Hmm. Right? And there's two ways to do that. Okay. Right. And one, and kind of like one of the ways is what we talked about, which is like a little break, right? You probably notice that If, you go on a work thing for a couple of days or maybe even more, maybe three days or a week. And when you come back it seems like everything has res sparkled, right? Even your kitchen. Yes. I'd imagine that If, you are away for enough time. You come back and the kitchen has res sparkled, right?

2:
Yes. It suddenly does look great. So does Chris

0:
And

2:
I think he looks

0:
Is like not so mad after

2:
All. And the home and everything else. It's, it's definitely something that that happens. In fact, we stole the world, the word sparkled for from Julia Roberts. So she has a quote where she says that her normal day is like, she gets up, she takes the kids to school, she comes back, she maybe goes on a bike ride, maybe with her husband, she has lunch, then it's time to pick them up and take them to their afterschool activities. And she says, well if I'd done that every day, you know, for months and months and months, it would just be boring. But I don't because I go away, you know, to film or whatever she does. And then she comes back and then it has wrist sparkled, right?

2:
Yes. Wrist sparkling, everything seems like she says it seems like there's pixie dust on it. Yes. And you can say, well Julia Roberts is not the average human being, right? Correct. She's quite a privileged person. But I think she's talking here about something that we can relate to, which is If. you take a little break and you come up, come back, then your life looks a little bit different, right? You dissipate to some degree it doesn't. Maybe it doesn't last very long, but you can see things a little bit bit differently. Dr.

Welcome back. It's your friend Mel. We are here with Dr. Sheret. She is teaching us so much about the latest research on the connection between change and happiness and joy. Dr. Sheret, do you have recommendations for how a person who's not leaving to go film a movie could do that if they're in a job that they go to all the time and they are in just this cycle of same person, same job, same you know, neighborhoods, same group of friends. How do you use this research to res sparkle some pixie dust on your life? Right?

2:
So two things. First is you could probably take a break, okay? To most people, they could still take a little break. You could still go away for a few days and come back. Now let's say you can't do that. Lori Santos, who is a professor at Yale suggest closing your eyes and imagining your life without these things, right? Imagine your life without that wonderful kitchen. Imagine your life without the partner, without the job that you have, right? And then when you open your eyes again, well things kind of are sparkle a little bit, right? That's, that's true. So that's, that's like a, a good little kind of exercise to do.

0:
I actually like that because I think the instinct is instead of closing your eyes and imagining your life without the person you're complaining about or without the kitchen that you have that is great and works fine and without, you know, the neighborhood you live in, that we instead look out instead of in and we go, oh well I like the way that relationship over there works better. And, I. Like the way that kitchen over there looks better. And then you bring it back to your life and pound on the people that are there, instead of taking a step to close your eyes and go, well what would my life look like if they weren't here?

0:
Now obviously if you're happy then you gotta make some changes. But If, you feel that little ache, then what do you do? Right? You just open your eyes and sprinkle a little fairy dust on. How does this impact our sex life?

2:
So again, if we, we go back to Esther Perez's research. Yep. Right? Her recommendations is breaks or novelty. Right? Putting yourself well

0:
Wife has already taken breaks. So that's

2:
Not putting yourself, putting yourself, she doesn't Yeah. She means, I think breaking away from that person for a little bit. It doesn't mean like a break in a relationship type.

0:
No, I meant like a break from sex, right? Like there's a lot of us in the menopause years that are like, you know, yeah we need to get more, more adventurous it don either. So either take a break in terms of, or a

2:
Novelty.

0:
Or introduce a novelty, right?

2:
And so the novelty is like a really interesting thing because, okay, so I was talking about breaks before and then the second thing you could do, yeah, to spice up your relationship, but in general to spice up your life is to introduce variety, right? So diversify, And I don't know that, you know, she necessarily is giving examples just about, you know, what's happening in the bedroom while you're in the bedroom. Because I think her point is that If, you do things in a way that's different outside. So once in a while when she said, oh, you see your, your partner on the stage, or you see them doing something that you've never seen that before, what her research suggests that that enhances attraction, right?

2:
But I think the, the message of like variety and novelty is important for our life in general. So people who have a more diverse life, they've maybe lived in different places, they work in different types of projects, they interact with different type of people, they tend to have a more psychologically rich life, right? So I think we could definitely do that. Whatever kind of life you have, you can actually shake things up a little bit. It can be something small, like how do you commute to work? What route do you take to work? It could be small like that or it could be like maybe take a course and it doesn't, it could be something online. Okay? So maybe you, you don't have the money to pay for like a new, but take up a new skill or a new listen to a new podcast, right?

2:
So try to change things or maybe start talking to someone or befriend some, someone who's different from the normal kind of people that you tend to interact. I'm not even, you know, like their personality is not the type that you usually are interacting with. And by diversifying we are doing a few things. We are disa habituating. 'cause now you know, we have different inputs that we're not used to. We also, as we talked about before, putting ourself in a context of learning, right? And that's important. Learning is always good. We enjoy learning.

0:
Well boost your happiness based on the research. Right? Exactly. I have another question about the research, which is when does habituation and the fact that you're now used to your life feel the most overwhelming?

2:
Right? So I think it is when things are not changing for a prolonged time and we see that in our midlife. And so there's this interesting thing called the U shape of happiness. So happiness is quite high in kids and teenagers and then it goes down, down, down and reach as rock bottom in your midlife. But then it starts going up again and actually remains quite high until the last couple years of life. And again, this u-shape is on average, right? So it's thousands of individuals and we're looking for a trend and you know, data from thousands of individuals. It doesn't mean that for every person midlife will be the bottom parts and you know, you'll be happy in the edges.

2:
But that's in general. And so why are people less happy in midlife? There could be many reasons, but one reason is it is the least amount of change, right? Mm. If you think about it as when you're a kid, things are changing all the time. I mean you are changing, you are growing, right? You are learning. It's like a most amount of change. Then you're in the twenties, you're trying different things, you're trying different partners, you're trying different professions. Maybe you're in university or in college, right? You're learning a lot. And then comes midlife and things are kind of similar. Most people kind of stay in the Same place 'cause maybe people have kids. You're mostly on average, maybe with the Same partner, you may be at the top of your game professionally, but you're kind of maintaining, right?

2:
You're not kind of looking up, you're not looking sideways, right? You're mostly just maintaining. And so that's the at least amount of learning, the least amount of change. Now counterintuitively at an older age, once the kids get out of the house and maybe you're retired In fact, you're starting to change again. Now you need to learn how am I gonna, how am I gonna live my life? It's a totally different life now, right? And so it can, it could seem like it'll be overwhelming and maybe it is at the beginning, but that causes people to start learning again.

0:
That is so cool. You literally just explained the midlife crisis and the journey of happiness of the human beings through the lens of neuroscience and the fact that we assimilate to the experiences around us. That's so cool. Dr. She, you do a ton of work with companies and team behavior and so I was just curious, how can you keep your teams motivated and creative when this habituation creeps in at a job where it's kind of the Same thing most days?

2:
Yeah. So you want to induce, inject variety into their daily work as well. And so one thing that companies tend to do is they take people and they rotate them through different divisions, right? Or get them to work on different types of projects with different types of people. And If, you do that. Then again, you're creating more change, more learning dis habituation. Not only are they learning something from this new division, but then when they go back to their old division now it's a break, right? So now they will see their division with new eyes, which means they might appreciate the good things that they kind of habituated to. They might see the bad things that weren't quite salient before.

2:
'cause they've been for, and that's a good thing. 'cause if I see the bad things, I'm gonna try to change them, right? Yeah. And so that will enhance out my wellbeing, right? But also it turns out it also enhances creativity. So it turns out If you change your environment and it could be even really small changes. Like I'm working in my office and now I'm going to work in a coffee shop, or I'm going to walk and maybe have like a meeting, you know, while walking. It turns out that that enhances creativity. So a research by a psychologist by the name of Kaylee, Maine, she found that creativity will be boosted after making these changes, right? Just changing your environment. Now that being said, the creativity boost only lasts for six minutes.

2:
However, however, those six minutes can be quite crucial, right? That could be the time when you come up with this new idea, you know, the new direction. And In fact, you know, if I think about all the times in my life when I had this like really important idea, the creative solution, it was never, when I was in front of my computer working and trying to think of a solution, it was mostly when I was somewhere else, right? Right. And so for one example, I was in my office trying to solve this problem. I couldn't solve it. So I decided to go to the gym, left the office, walked to the gym, gym's quite close. It took me less than six minutes to get there. But on the way is when I suddenly came up with a solution, right?

2:
And, I don't know that I necessarily was consciously thinking about it, but I think I had this all the information in my mind. And then I just changed my environment. And, that kind of changed something in the way that my brain was processing things and the solution appeared, which was to be a really important kind of breakthrough that will lead to, you know, a lot of what I did after that. And if I think about it every single time, every single time when I had an idea, which would be like, oh, that would be my next book, or that might be my next research direction, or there's some problem that I was, it was in that kind of situation. I was simply in a new place. Right? Yeah. Another one was I, I was in a conference listening to these talks. They were super interesting.

2:
But then after the conference I went, and this was in San Francisco, so I went to a vineyard. And I was just sitting outside and having a little wine. And then suddenly the idea came based on the knowledge that I already had during the conference. But it was like being in this like totally new different environment, right? Where the processing happened and the creative idea came about. Well,

0:
I think a lot of people have the experience of either being out on a walk in the nature or on some vacation or away for the weekend. And that's where people tend to make big decisions and have these breakthroughs because you get a break from your life, which gives you much needed perspective about what's important or what you've always been thinking about. So if there were one change or one thing that you hope the person listening would do as a rel result of this conversation and all of the research, what is one action that somebody could take that you think would make a big difference in their life?

2:
One action that you could take that will make a big difference? I think it is try something new and look, it might make no difference, right? It depends, right? But it might, it might make a big difference. So try something new, Whether it is, you know, think about something that you want to learn, right? Think about a new skill that you wanna have. Maybe you know, somewhere that you wanna visit. Just something, try a new dish to make, I don't know, I think that would not necess, it could change your life, right? It could be that of course you think it will change your life, but I think most likely what it may do, it would give you this kind of like joy of novelty.

2:
Hmm. Which then may create a habit of trying new things.

0:
I love that. And I love to, and my interviews with brilliant people like you by giving you an opportunity to just talk directly to the person that is listening. They might be driving a car or unloading the dishwasher or taking you on a walk with them. And I would love to give you the opportunity to just give them any parting words or some sort of message from you.

2:
Sure. So we end our, the book that, that I wrote together with my co-author, Kasan saying, we end that with a chapter that's called Experiments in Living. Okay? So my parting words is Experiment in Living. And the idea here is that you don't really know what's good for your life or for society without doing experiments. Just like in science, I don't know what the ground truth is until I do my experiments. And sometimes it's surprising. And so the idea is that If, you do these experiments in living, try things in in different ways. Try them in new ways. It could be you are actually taking out some stuff from your life, right? Try to maybe see what happens.

2:
If, you go off social media for a few weeks, right? See how that impacts you? Maybe you like it, maybe you don't like it, right? Or maybe it's adding something to your life. Experiments in living allows you to try, you know, everything. Or not everything, but like, you know, more things to find out what are the optimal things for me and what doesn't really work.

0:
