Right on the box. Yeah, It does right There. But And, we had had Celebrating 90 ERs. How about That Donuts have been around for 90 ERs. Well. These donuts have probably been around longer than 90 ERs. That's a good point. Lamar, back then, back in 1933, figured it out. Yellow box man. I. See these things? This ERs like fucking this. ERs like seeing gold. It's like finding Pokemon when You. See a fucking yellow box just on like a random desk. Now You know. That a Football facility. Yeah. It's just like, oh Shit.


I. Wondery. If they got the blueberry glaze in there, Well You. Know That. I'm a very critical of donuts. I don't like cake Donuts. It's a waste of time. Dunno why anybody likes them. A what? It's not, not a donut. It's a cake. It's a circular cake. A donut needs to be fluffy. And. Airy. And. You. Always start with glaze. Go with the simplest thing. Don't Get. All these concoctions where they try And. Sell You on these gimmicky donuts. Didn't You have a gimmicky donut named after You? I did. And. We raised some money. So. It was for a good cause. Some, some people like 'em. Listen, if that's what You like, that's what You like. But You always start with a simple donut. Yeah. Give it a little pull test.


It's a good pull. It's a good pull part. Yeah. It ERs It's got good gluten structure. Yeah. And. It's also this. We're this ERs. This ERs in the afternoon. And. These were made in the morning. So. It's a good Observation. It's a good Donut. Yeah. It ERs Really good Donut. It's fantastic. Donut. You could see how like Jason's fingerprints are like, they're in it. It's You. Know what I mean.

I mean it. Not bad. I like a Nice. Little sugary chunk here.


And there. It's not bad. Very good. Yep. It almost tastes like it's like almost a little bit under baked. Dude. I'm telling You And. I. Think That. That's good though. Like it's I like it, but it could have, oh yeah. I could have maybe spent like a second more on the fryer. Ooh, All Right. Ooh. I grabbed the best one in the box right now. How Doess Portnoy do this. Would You give it like a, something outta 10 or something like That. I mean it ERs 10 outta 10 right here. You can't give it a 10. Yeah, I can. What do You do with the rest of the donuts? What if we Get a donut that's better than That one? Then It's what? What if You Get a donut better than this? And. You've already rated this a 10. What do You rate That one.


That's a good point. That's why You don't ever go straight to 10. I gotta rerate this one. Then You can't. Rerate. Yes. You can't. You can't Rerate. Yeah. This ERs 10. That's why You Don't go 10. You gotta go below 10. You always gotta give options to go higher. No, It's a good donut. It's a fucking 10. Outta 10. It's not A 10. What ERs it? It's a, it's slightly under baked. It's got great structure. Sugary glaze could be a little bit more smooth. I'm gonna go seven, eight. What? Ah, I'll go. Eight two. Eight. Two. Good donut. Good donut. Nice. Really good. Donut. Nice very happy with this donut. Yeah. You're serious about your reviews. I. Think this ERs a phenomenal donut.


I'm enjoying the hell out of it. And, when I feel this I give it a 10. So. You're gonna Get a lot of 10 donuts. Dude, what's up with, but they also, they also have cake. I eat 10 donuts. So. They also have Every Friday before practice. You eat 10. Well rate at 10 I. Really? Don. I only eat like four, but that's just a carve up right before, before Friday Practice. Heres a Don. They also have cake I. Don't know how anybody could prefer this to this. They Need, they need the, yeah. I. Hear You. They need the blueberry glaze. There's a blue. This ERs the Lazy man's donut. Know it goes good. There's nothing to this With coffee. It goes good with coffee. Listen, I'm not saying it's bad, like it's sugar And dough.


It's gonna be good. I fucking love these things. I'm just wearing all this sugar too. And. I'm just gonna piece by piece. Just eat it. All right. Well There. You. Have it. 8.2 10. Meaningless. If you're in, if you're in Kansas City, make sure You, check out Lamars. You. Got a bunch of locations all over the place. Bold topics to wrap up. Week five in the NFL. Yeah, baby. start with my game. That's S Right How about That Chiefs 26 Saints 13 I. Don't even know if That score adequately reflects how much You guys pretty much dominated the whole game. If You guys could Get in the end zone fucking more, it would be even higher.


Tell me about it. Let's start with the offense. You guys dominated the time of possession. The entire first half really gotta go. And. Kareem Hunt. Again, another solid outing. Reem coming out of nowhere wasn't on anybody's team. And, sure enough, him. And, Juju, misuser, You. Think That. They're kind of Don in the NFL. They come to the Chiefs. And look like two of the best players in the NFL. I, Don. I. Don't I. Don't Get. How these guys were just Well. Ju Ster was in New England. He didn't have any quarterbacks throwing him The ball. That's a good point. Yeah. Kareem had Nick shout out to Jacob Che over there in Cleveland. One of my favorite quarterback sneakers. They were there. I mean. Nick Chubb. You want to give That guy the ball. You do And.


We want to give Kareem the ball. And. He's absolutely killing it right now. He's Doing great. You guys have needed it in Pop's absence. Him And Carson Steel have stepped up. Don Day, Kareem Hunt ended with a hundred And two yards a touchdown for some stat nerds out there, which I know everybody loves That now. Mm. Just the Northeast Ohio ball player. Baby I mean the guy. This ERs his first touchdown ERs a chief in 2,149 days. It was a Kareem Hunt style touchdown. Just break a few tackles break, run through a few arm tackles And. Did he break some tackles? I'm pretty sure Kareem breaks at least one tackle every time he talks ball every Time. Yeah. That's a good, that's a good running back attribute.


Dude. He's also the first chief to carry the ball 27 times since Oh, yeah. That's s right. Kareem Hunt also did That on December 24th. Yeah, 2017. Yeah. It was a good idea back in 2017. Now it it's still a good idea. Yeah. To, to hand him Hey. Just Well. Especially If, if It's working. Oh, yeah. Juju Smith Schuster also had some stats out there. Led all receivers for the Kansas City Chiefs to seven receptions for 130 yards. Everybody was Wondery what That Kansas City offense was gonna look like without Rashid Rice. How they were gonna place 'em. And Juju goes out there with a big game for a hundred. And 30 almost had a touchdown, but That, we'll talk about That in a second. Yeah. Some stats for those nerds. Juju's 130 receiving yards are his most in the game since the 20 20 20 21 season.


Wild card round with the Steelers. Juju ERs also the first chief wide receiver, not named she Rice with a hundred Plus yards receiving in a single regular season games. Since that's s right. Juju again had 124 yards against the 49 ERs on October 23rd. 2022. Yeah. Yeah. Why was it So easy to simply just put Juju in the game? And. Then all of a sudden him to ball out Well one. Both these guys are familiar with the offense. They're familiar with the scheme. Yeah. I think they're familiar with the nucleus of the coaching staff. And, the players. That. That. We got here. So. They just, honestly, it just felt like we got our guys back in the building.


Yeah. It wasn't, there was no like, right, right. Let's ease 'em into it. It was like, no, they, they're ready to rock And. Roll Right now. And, And, all the terminology And know all the plays. Yeah. And. I mean Juju's won a Super Bowl with us. Kareem's had unbelievable success in this offense before. So. Yeah. I. Think when it comes down to what Coach Reed ERs gonna call, everybody's very familiar on how to have success with it. Yeah. And And. Andy knows how to utilize those guys to their strengths. 100%. And, pat knows how to Get these guys. The ball. Yep. And, And, And. He's, he's, he's trusting it. Yeah. Which ERs awesome to see. Well the other person. He's trusting ERs. Primetime. Big Yeti. That's s Right ERs.


We all know Travis came up big because he had someone special in, in the stadium. Someone That means a lot to him. And. He really tries to always perform Well when they're there. And That ERs. Me Have I. Have I ever had A bad game? Not in Kansas City. I didn't have a great game when we played guys. You played Always had good games. When I show up, Well I guess last year, I didn't ever Which one? Great game. Which game? The playoff game. You dominated in the playoffs. Those are the only games I went to last year. Oh. I thought I was like talking to like the games. That I played against You guys. Oh, that's true. The the game That we played last year wasn't like Outstanding.


Yeah. Super Bowl game. The Super Bowl game. You had a couple big catches. Yeah. You didn't go for a hundred, but You still went. It was a good day. It was like 90 or something. 89 something. That. Yeah. You still had a good day. I do. I Do love a good Monday Night Showdown. Come on now. God damn. Come on now. So. I mean I was fired up For That one. It's also the knees feel a little bit better. You got a little bit extended rest too. Hey, Hey, Right. It's crazy what That Extra Day does. It's yeah. One just 24 hours later. It's crazy How big of a difference it makes for the body ERs. Remarkable. Which he will pay the price of this week. Oh, You know. Bye week. I forgot. Yeah. That's Nice. Yeah. So. You're not on A short week. It's I mean. I'd rather have a shorter week.


And have my bye later in the season. But it's fair. Yeah. It's early. Early buy sucks. Yeah, dude, the Chiefs have the ability to turn the lights off. And on now in the stadium. Like Talking about they didn't have an off switch for their lights. No. I. Don't think So, I think they were always on. There's no way that's possible. Either That or like You know. Remember like in in like they I know You High school or like older lights When You turn em off. They would have, they would take 'em a while to go off or You turn 'em on. You'd have to wait for, they Wait for the, They're not fluorescent. What ERs it? Yeah. Gym I. Don't know the name of them, but yeah. Now we have the ability because Yeah, they, they replaced When can't the, the lights were off. Yeah. And I was like, man, we hadn't had That Before.


How about That. Top flight organization. Chiefs getting new lights. How about it. Baby. Who said We had the worst facility? Millions of dollars at stake here. And. We can finally turn our lights off. And on. Add a button. Yeah. Let's Get Right to the play. Everybody's talking about Travis. And. That's the lateral You. Guys got about Don. Don't know how much time was left in the half, maybe 30 seconds. Something like That. No way. It was not 30 seconds. It was like two minutes. Like just under the two minutes. No Chance. There was two minutes left. You guys were way under the, It was just under the two min. We got the ball back. And almost scored again. Oh, this was the first possession. Yeah. Am s right on That. Three And a Half minutes left. Yeah. Thank You. Okay. I thought That. This was the second two minute deal yet.


All right. Either way. Third In 22, 3 And a Half minutes left. Alright right there. You go. Thank You third And. 22. Most teams are like Hey. Let's just Get Get the ball in the middle of the field. Push it forward. Make it a little bit easier for old butt kicker. And. You guys decided to not do That. Well. I actually went into the huddle. Like Hey Boys. Let's just Get. Let's just make sure we Get in the field goal range here. I, remember saying That in the huddle. Yeah. And. And. Then Pat literally said, yeah, listen, You are That. Like you're the underneath guy. Like if you're open, quick, just Hey. I'm probably gonna go to You. Yeah. Just kind of Get North Get ERs much ERs You can.


We're kicking the field. Yep. Well. That's not what You did. Here's a clip for those of You. That didn't see what he did. He did probably the riskiest thing. That, any coach. Got it. It's actually like anybody else. That does stick the plan. Stick the plane. Stick the plan. Stick the plane. Oh my God. He's laterally again. Oh my God. Hey. How about That. We almost got a first down Okay. What was going on in here? I. Don't So. I knew before You even pitched this. No, You didn't. When You caught it, And, the, the first thing thing You did was not tuck it, but You held it like this. Well I didn't know what I was. Like. This dude ERs And. You looked And. I'm this dude who's about to pitch the ball. Then You tucked it. And I was like Okay. Thank God he ERs not pitching it. And I was like, oh no. He actually ERs still gonna do it. So, what goes on in your head?


It all happens. So fast. I kind of black out, which I'm sure Coach Reed ERs gonna love hearing. Just, I'm sure Coach Re doesn't care because there's never been one of these. That hasn't t work out. Ah, One. Otherwise, can We knock? Yeah. That's s right. Yeah. We don't want to jinx this. So. When You, when You catch this ball, do You just know That. P Ryan's gonna be in the flat line there. I have no idea. That, he had a chip. Anything on the backside? I was Whatcha You? Leave You. Just know. I was reversing. I was reversing field. I felt guys over pursue. You felt everyone pursuing to You. And. I was like, oh, And. You kind of just Know I could Get. More yards going this way. Yeah. And then, but And. Then I realized I couldn't Get. More yards going, but what ERs causing You to look And.


See if there's somebody behind You. There's A, there's a guy in red over here. I. Just feel Same. You. Just feel That. Yeah. It's like fast break basketball. You. Just You here. And. You. Just feel that's looks like running in the lane. You Look like Larry Bird out there. Larry Bird, Larry Legend. I'll take That. Just a better looking version. I mean Larry was an ugly guy. Honest. Yeah, but Larry's a smooth Operation. He was very smooth. Hell yeah. He was Well. You got the fourth And one. It was imp. Incredible. I loved That. I. I mean You. Can't just throw it on me. Samaje. Unbelievable job by Piran. Don. He had a good, actually like Be ready because he was, he was kind of like shuffling. Did You See his quote after The game? No. I didn't. What'd he say he Was? It's not in here, but he was. He was like, yeah, because he has a P Round's only been here for how long?


Three weeks. Exactly. Four weeks. No, I. Guess the beginning of the season. It Was like Right around the Start. He, yeah. He ERs been here for five weeks. Don don't think he was. Was he there for week one? I. Think So. Okay. So. He ERs been here, but he was a late edition. Yeah, he, he was definitely here since the beginning of the season. For Sure. Alright. Right, So. Either way he ERs like, yeah, You know I saw him do it a couple times in practice. And I just figured You know Hey I. Guess I'll just stay in phase here. It's a ball player right there. That's a ballplayer right there. I. Love it, man. They were like, Have You ever been a part of something like That And? He ERs like, nah. What? What was it like? He's like, Hey. It's like I'm playing backyard Football. It's fun. Let's go baby. Some Other reactions. Coach Reed was asked about it.


And. And. This was actually going into half. Coach Reed was asked about the play And. He said, We do it every day in practice. I can I can't tell You the name of it. So. Andy clearly acted like this was something That was called I mean And. He's not lying. Scott told me this on because I did the halftime segment too. Yeah. And. They said this clip And. I was like, there ain't no chance. That was called The old reverse field. Lateral. Yeah. From our foot. No. Yeah. And. Especially in That situation. No, That was not Called I. Mean coaches isn't lying though. We do We. Do every You do do it a lot. Yeah. We do it. Every I mean Said it too. Yeah. He was ready for it for a reason. We do In practice. So And I think they might should just start letting You do it.


I think Andy Kind of does. Listen, just what did Andy say to You? You have to let it, What did Andy say to You? I ha I haven't talked to coach about it. See, that's how he's You know. He ERs letting You do it. Well. If he did, if if anybody else did it, he would be crushing them. What? Travis. Why would he be crushing them if he got us to fourth And? One. The only reason only chance to convert, Because most people are, if they try And, do That a lot, it's gonna lead to fumbles. And turnovers, but knows, but Don do it a lot. For some reason, You have this weird Spiderman sense for laterally. The Football That doesn't make any sense. I'll tell You what Tyler, Other than the fact That You played basketball. My guy Honey Badgers, Tyra Matthew could have absolutely smoked me on That play. He ran the right past You full Speed.


You'll see me I like Brace my son. Yeah. Oh God. Yeah. After I talked, You were exposed. He like bolded it. Nah man. It was a fun play. And. It got us a fourth And one. And got us a chance to convert, man. Another Quote from one of your teammates. Pat was asked about the play. I told him I wa I told him. I was throwing it to him. So, we could kick a field goal. Yes. Makes sense. And. He laterals it all the way across the field. It's like I'm talking to Sterling. Oh, his daughter does. In one ear out the other I got You. Nah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. I'm pretty sure I replied with I. Got You. Yeah. No, that's, yeah. What else would we be doing here? Yeah. No, I got it. No, I'm with You. Field goal Fourth. And one.


Hey. We're going for touchdown because You guys ended up getting the fourth And one. We got the fourth And one. And, but We ended up kicking the field. Kicking field Anyways, but Hey kept, kept the drive alive. Yeah. Nick Siri actually called me this morning asking if it was a design play. Dude, if You watch it from like the, the like full 22. It looks, there's no way You could You Don't Think it does. Oh, because of the The chip. It's The chip And on top of That. It's just like the lateral across field. Like that's, I'm not banking on That ERs a coach That. Everything's gonna go right. Yeah. To where somebody could run across field And then throw it. That's Fair. I think he knew the answer when he was asking it to me. Yeah, He just wanted hear.


But We do practice it. Then We got You in the wildcat. Second half. Pat motions out the big Yeti goes to the Q position. And. You guys do a little zone read type option. Yeah. It sounded, it wasn't a zone, but You guys do a little read. Read the end. It was Like the power lead. Yeah, exactly. With Xavier worthy going on like a little f he's going flat at the end. Collapses on the run. Hand to Xavier. Jason You know this place. R too. Well man. This ERs the first play I've ever had in college. Football, just a Nice. Little Travis for a touchdown at the Bobcat quarterback. Follow Jason up the up the lane, man. right up the hash baby. But You Did not hand it off, or You did not keep it.


You handed it off to Xavier who went around the end for Well. You. Gotta to read the end. You gotta read the end. You can't be Selfish, but I could tell. You wanted to keep That bitch I almost, because You dragged That read out ERs long ERs possible. You like, please take it. Please take That. I have, See if they You can't, some of these DNS are getting savvy on these reads. If You, So, You gotta, You, gotta, you're Right. You. Gotta keep 'em honest. And. Then they'll jump back out. You're Right. You. Gotta keep 'em honest. They're seeing it a lot more nowadays, especially with the way offenses are incorporating these types of plays. More And More. Yeah. But at the end of the day, if it's, if it's cloudy, give it to the fastest guy on the team. That's probably a safe bet. All Right. He can just run Everybody just go running there. I'll tell You what man, he's the fine You Get score to the touchdown. Xavier's been killing it, man. He has been I, absolutely love watching him play, man.


I love playing with him on the field. And, he, he has this crazy like ability when he has the ball to just Get. Like, he's like this. He's already skinny, but he just SLIs. He slithers through shit. Slither ERs a good trait for a ball Career. It's, it ERs And. I'm not gonna lie. He, he slithered his way in on That one. We needed it big Well. He also slithered his way over to his mama after the Za, if you're worthy. He found his mom in the stands. And gave her the ball. Which Hey? How can You out love a guy that's giving the ball to mama? Yeah. You already know what's mama worthy. I was trying to catch him the whole time. I was like, come here. Come here. I handed it to You. Yeah, I. Oh, you're going to your mouth. Oh, Nice. Yeah. Love it. Yep. Hard to beat That.


She'll have some love Well. She'll, she'll put That one on the mantle, I'm Sure. Then we gotta talk about the other thing. And. That's the thing. That has been dominant for the chiefs for I mean two ERs now. And, that's his defense. Spagnola has been running the best defense in the NFL for close to two ERs now. Spags man. I love That Guy. What else ERs there to say about the defense? That hasn't already been So. I mean I knew. Listen, when You went, new Orleans struggled big time against the Eagles. And, Jalen Carter, And. Then they're out three interior guys or two interior guys. I'm like, dude, Chris Jones about to have a day. And. He did not disappoint. He was I. I mean It was Chris Jones. I'm pretty sure You could have your interior guys in there. It's a good point. It doesn't matter.


Yeah, but I mean Chris Jones. With those guys out, it's like even more like, gosh, how are they gonna do this? I mean And. They did it. You gotta You. Gotta have a plan. And, Well, they had a plan. And, then they got Chris Jones. I mean I. Get. It feel like Mr. Jones, what's That? Mr. Jones? Mr. Jones. Jones. I can't do it right now. Who got, There's a thing going on, man. It, it's Mr. Jones. He got a thing. Go win on. He's swimming. The guards All Right. Bull Rush in the center, Man. He ERs You. Wanna talk about Sli? It's a big slither guy right there. Yeah, That's a guy. That shouldn't be Slithery, but he ERs.


But he ERs. Yeah. Like he does like I. Feel like whenever I like Get a chance to block him in practice. He just knows That. He could just pick me up. And move me. Yeah. So. He just has fun trying to slither me. Yeah, Well. He, he, he knows he can go to That. Yeah. So. He works on the slither. So. That. He has both in his pocket. The defense got the momentum going right from the jump When be Cook my Well. Yeah. Be cook. My man Carr just threw a I. Mean it was like a jackpot throw jackpot. What was he doing? Just dude, What Does That throw dude? And. I love Derek Hart. Derek Carr. Yeah. Who doesn't I fucking love him when he's on? He ERs like the best score. DC ERs, I. Don't know what That was.


I've seen Derek car throw some, throw some ties. Of course he threw me one in the Pro Bowl. Actually he Threw one in this Game. Yeah, he did. Yeah. There was do a bomb. It Was, yeah, it was fucking, it was he You rebounded Nice from the interception. I was, it was one of my like backyard Football moments in the Pro Bowl. Yeah, he's in there. We Get into the red zone. We had ran the the Tampa the corner concept. So Many fricking times. Yeah. That I went up to him. And I was like Hey. If they play That cover three. I'm just about to run That Corner post And. He looked at me, he was like, he it like registered in his head. He ERs like, all right, sure enough. Right. I'm talking about on time. Three And a hitch Right on two So. The same throw he made in the in That game. ERs the same throw he made because they ran a corner post.


That's what they scored on. Yes. But mine wasn't like 80 yards downfield. It was just like a little like 15 yard touchdown. Fair enough. But essentially, yeah, he was ready for it. Yeah. There. You go I. Just I. Just like it when like QBs are just ball players. You know what I mean. Like guys they like, They're not regimented into like, yeah, the lines on the paper. And like man, I just this Read, then this read, then this. Read And, then I do this. And. Then You gotta You. Gotta go out here. And. Make sure. Shake. Yeah. Make sure. Yeah. Well, here's some stats for the chief's defense. That has been unbelievable through the first half of the season. Well through the first quarter of the season, the opposing teams feature running backs are a combined 66 carries for 169 yards.


That ERs a whopping 2.6 yards per carry. Zilch. Derek Henry, who has been un looked unstoppable these last few weeks for Baltimore I. Guess really just That last play this past week, but 13 carries for 46 yards against chiefs. Zach Moss, 12 carries for 34 yards. Bi Jean Robinson heard of That guy. He ran all over the Eagles. 16 carriers for 31 yards. JK Dobbins, 14 carriers for I mean these are awful stat lines. Alvin Cmera. One of the best running backs over the last What? I mean? You just named four of the Yeah. Top running backs in the NFL right there. And. Not just like this year like That had Been. Yeah. Up there. Yeah. Like Alvin Kamara. 11 carries 26 yards again.


I went into the game not expecting much. Spags was A good one. And, he got half of those yards on a, That's s Right. That reversed like A play. That was shake down a Play. That he made happen. Yeah. Which that's what he does. And obviously we can throw Spags names out there, but the defense just play So great together. Yeah. And, when it comes to the run game. Mcna George, Carl Loft. His guys are just like playing their part. And. Then You got the backer's just flying the fuck around. Yeah. Bolton's all over the place. Bolton Tran, he Smith screens out I mean he's, he's Drew Tranquil ERs out there flying the fuck around. Like Yeah. ERs. Leo. Chanel a DN now He's everything. He's, he's our like jack of all trade. right? He could just do everything. Yeah. He's fucking John CNO I.


Just wanna see him come to the game in Js. In a fucking big T in a hat sideways like this. Well You guys saw a few familiar faces come to the game this week.

Let's move along to some week five storylines. Talk about some of the biggest storylines coming outta week five in the NFL Me And Jason actually watched Sunday Football together. We Did We did I. I fell asleep on some of those afternoon games. You did The four o'clock games. You took a Nice little nap, which you're getting ready to play. Monday So. Yeah. And You. You dozed off there a little bit towards the I. Did I took a little 15 minute power nap. But That's what Sundays are for. Yeah. Sunday was officially the longest day of NFL Football ever How about That. The London game kicked off The London game. Yeah. At 9:32 AM Eastern on Sunday And. Sunday Night Football ended at 1:00 AM Eastern because of the rain delay. Yeah. That's a long day. That's a pretty crazy day. I will say this though, man, there's just nothing better than just getting the crew together.


And watching some Football. Man. I agree. I mean it's a reason why it's the most popular sport in in America. It's just And. YouTube TV just makes it So fun. 'cause You can watch four games of women. Yeah. It's just You. Could You always have something to talk about And. Something to see I say the Sunday ticket. And being able to watch all the games drastically improves Sunday to It's, There's nothing worse than being stuck with the two games. That are on. That are just abysmal games. Yeah, because now you're just watching like Ep n to see what's happening in the good games. Yeah. So being able to go to all the games ERs. It's a big bonus. I'm with You man watching That. What was it? We were watching the Baltimore game. And. Baltimore game.


Baltimore. Cincinnati. That was a fricking, That was awesome. That was a banger. Slower First half, but the second half was fuck Bombs over Baghdad. Dude. That Lamar. We're gonna probably Get to it. Huh? Don don't know. I don't know what he put in this rundown. No, we're not. Dude. That Lamar Touchdown. Where he broke like three stiff arm. He's going. dns. It's going stiff Arm. Hubbard And. He's running. Still rolling. I stood on him twice. He like Bow. Hubbard came back from there. B in And. He keeps going. And. I'm like, dude, he's about, there's no way he's about to throw. There's Yes. He ERs gonna throw Him in the end zone there. Likely in the end zone. And. It was a dime right there. Isaiah. Likely I. Don't know how Isaiah likely was. That open. I mean You can legitimately hold people. I'm not gonna lie. I don't. I don't understand what We were doing. ERs the You can hold.


You can like tackle the guys. Yes. I. And. There were two guys over there. Yeah. They Were just looking at Lamar. Which I mean? I Guess. I mean. Yeah. I probably would've been mesmerized by the Lamar was doing too. Nice now. That. I. Think about it. Yeah. I man Burrow was throwing lights out too. Dude. Him And. Chaser Well. It was a old fashioned gun. Listen, they were talking about defense. The whole first three to four weeks has been how the defenses are taking over. The league points are down all over the place. We're tr I mean grown. Men are crying about too high safety defenses. And how we need to outlaw 'em. Mel Hyper. Dude. He did. It's embarrassing. He did go on a ran. Yes. Call him. Stick the drafting. Alice's mouth And. Then Lamar And.


Joe Burrow go out there. And like ERs this ba. The when Baseball complains about the No, we need to wind the baseballs up a little bit. We need more offense. We Need to We do need to back the mound up. What I'm a big fan of backing the mound up. Get The fuck. You're our Mel Kuper right now. That's Fine. I don't care. I'm not a baseball player. So. I can be Mel Kiper baseball. I Get to be That. Now You're ridiculous. That Mound Distance was set when people were throwing like 80 miles an hour. What? When That That distance. The last time they moved That Mound back was ano a like a time in baseball when offensive like production was struggling. Again. And. They wanted more hits. They wanted more on people on base. They wanted to make the game have more action.


So, they moved the mound back. They haven't moved it back in like Don. Don't know. I. Forget the dates. So. I'm not just gonna pull a number outta my ass, but it's been a long time. The hitters have also gotten better. Yeah. I. Just think That. They should move it Better. Just a little bits better. They're outlawing the shift. They outlawed the shift. I think that's ridiculous. You should be able to line up however You Want the shift. You should be Able to shift. Don't tell me why I can't like hit it over there. I. Think That was stupid. I just moved the mound Back then. I guess that's probably closer to to two high safety things. That's what I'm, yeah. Yeah. So. What? What would be equivalent to baseball? To moving the mound To Football Would be the kickoff. It Would be like if they, if like what they probably should do for kickers.


Kickers are making like 60 yarders. Like it's routine. We need to narrow these field goal. It's too easy to kick field goals Now. We gotta narrow. We gotta narrow. We. Gotta go to rugby. We gotta go to rugby. Goalposts. I'm O like Kickers should not be influencing Football games ERs much. ERs. They are right now. Me. And Con Bar. When said this like 10 ERs ago. We need to Get specialists out of the NFL Specialist. Just kickers. So. How ERs it? How was it ERs to win it at the end? Freaking corner. Ruined the game for Everything's Gonna be a bearing. Now I. Don't know. It Adds excitement to the game. Just throw the ball through the up. Right. Why do we have to have this guy come outta here? And. Kick it. That doesn't belong in the Football Field. That's too easy. Make it tighter.


You. Just make it make he's got. Just have a big one Post. And. You. Just gotta Hit the post. Post. Hit the post. That's three points. I don't want these guys going out there in soccer shoes. And You can't touch 'em. And or make believe like this ERs a Football play. Harry's won me a lot of Football games, man. Well. Yeah. I'm sure you're pro kickers. He's got a great kicker. Jake Elliot. Shout out to Jake Elliot. He's a great kicker too. Yeah. I just disagree with everything about it. Back to offenses not being dead rookies. Jayden Daniels, Caleb Williams, And Bo Nicks each had 200 Plus. And Big wins. Big, Big days for the rookies. How about it, man. And. We were just So. we went to Andrew Tino's show. Yeah. And after the show Side town After the show.


Santino being a Bears fan asked me about Kle Boy. I'm like, I. Don't know it. Don't look That good. And. Then all of a sudden he goes out And plays like That, And I made sure to text Santino halfway through the game. Like Hey Caleb Williams looks pretty good today. Yeah, exactly. Dude. He, him And, Jayden Daniels both have the ability to extend the play. For sure. So. I feel like with them it's, it's all about understanding the scheme. And under And, getting the ball out in time. Yeah. And things like That And. Letting those extra You know extended plays like come naturally. Yeah. I. Think Caleb in the beginning was, was trying to do a lot with the ball in his hands. Yeah. He, he wasn't confident. And. Sometimes You just You need to have a few of those games to Get acclimated into the NFL And.


Now You realize what You can. And cannot do. Every I mean he's getting Acclimated. The coaches are getting used to what he's good at. And. He can, I'm not, I'm, I'm not gonna say he was the team at USC, but he had to do a lot at USC. Yeah, sure. And to feel like That in the NFL ERs. Fucking unfair Well. He's Got a lot of good weapons. That's what I'm saying. So. It's like sometimes it's just letting let your guys DJ do do some work for You man. Yeah. Well. He was finding DJ And. He was actually he was. That's what he was doing. He was throwing, he was slinging That thing around. right? Yeah. He looked more comfortable this week. The O line was I mean The Panthers were not offering much of a rush. Yeah. Sometimes just needed You know Get a little confidence booster. Dude. Don don't know. All I know ERs. That. Yeah. Some, some guys take a little bit more time to like feel more comfortable.


Obviously this ERs he's been getting better. Yeah. And. Whether that's him getting more comfortable. The coaches Get more comfortable. The offensive line playing better. It could be a number of things. All I know ERs. That. It looked pretty good this past week. So. Hopefully they can build on it. Their defense ERs role And. I did not know they were three. And two. Yeah. I thought the bears were terrible. And. Then all of a sudden I look at the record. I'm like, they're a winning Football team. Yeah. I forgot. Yeah. No, they're, that's the NFL for You bud. This ERs me high level NFL And analyst right here. Yeah. On primetime television. Didn't even know the fucking Bears record. I was like, I'm not paying attention. And. Then they suck And. Then all of a sudden it's like, oh, Hey I. Guess I. Gotta watch the Bears now. Might Be the best division of Football. That's my opinion.


Santino In terms of records, I think they are the best division of Football. I think that's s right. Them Minnesota, lions, And, green Bay. All of 'em are good. Yeah. Yeah. NFC North I mean ERs there. Anybody else that's even close? I thought the A FC East was gonna be good this year. They suck again every time. I. Think the Af I thought they were gonna be great last year. And. Then like it's like the bills are even struggling now. All of a sudden they beat the brakes off of Jacksonville And. Now the last two ERs or the last two weeks, they've kind of calmed down. Jacksonville found a way to Get a dub Dougie Pete down there. They Did. They find they got their first win win. Sometimes You. Gotta gotta Get back on Get. Back on the tracks baby. That's S Right. That's s Right. Yeah. And. Joe Flacco reached a top speed at 18.7.


Six miles per hour bro. He was Moving. Moving. Yeah. The big man still got the stride. Yes he does. He's got long legs. Yeah, he's got some new shoes. I saw him on Pat. McAfee said he ERs got, he's got like coconut something or something. What the fuck they say about his shoes? Brandon can You Get this I'm looking. ERs a weird Don. Don't know. Yeah, Well he, he also threw for 350 yards And. Three touchdowns. That's Probably better than the 18 mile per hour run. Yeah. I think the more impressive one though. ERs the 18 mile per hour run because Yeah, I just don't know too Many like what 39 year olds That can do. That. Yeah. Yeah. Not just 39 but 39 year olds. That were not known for running previously. He's never been known for being A runner.


No. Alec Pierce, former Bearcat had a lot of those receiving yards. I bought it. Huh? Bearcats just making plays all weekend. Yeah, all weekend while the Bearcats were on a buy coming back baby. Yeah. So. It's good. That. The NFL offense aren't dead because That ERs makes for exciting games. Definitely happy to see the production getting back up there. Speaking of getting up there, let's Get to the Giants doing something That a lot of people have never seen before. This ERs all over social media giants in their win over the Seahawks 29 20 score. A late minute fumble a block kick for a touchdown. The Giants jump over or jump through the A gap.


Yeah. 19. Who's 19 do You know? 19. Isaiah Simmons. Isaiah Simmons. Yeah. Bald play's the athletic ERs. Hell Yeah. Jumps through the A gap. A lot of people didn't know You could jump. You can jump in the NFL. It ERs a illegal thing to jump. You're allowed to jump. You just can't land on anybody or use yourself to propel upwards off of somebody. But You can indeed jump on an NFL field. Noted. Randy Moss made a career out of it. They also didn't know That You couldn't hold people down. Which That ERs a little bit of a gray area. 100% You. It's like there's one thing about You can't yanking someone down. You can't like grab And, pull the person forward. That's definitely against the rules.


Yeah. I've seen That call that's holding. But if You are just, if You are just assisting somebody who's already going in a way, And other words to in order for You to not Get your ass kicked on field goal. You need to be ERs low ERs possible. So every line. What they do ERs they Get ERs. Low ERs possible And then rise on contact So. What the Giants did here ERs, they just put their hands on the O linemen when they already went low themselves. So. That's not holding. They just assisted them in going Whoa Assisted. Nice Assisted And. Then Simmons jumps out through the A gap. Great timing. One of the reasons You don't see this. Don ERs much ERs 'cause it's near impossible for the jumper to time it That.


Perfect. Yeah. To be able to jump not touch any of the O linemen Get through cleaning those Two guys to Get the hold or the assist. The assist On the O line down And. Then to then land And, then Reju. There's like a And. Then the, there's a million things That have to go Right for this to Get pulled off. ERs there ERs There a world where they call this a a penalty And. It's like, yeah, You can't do That Like in the future. No. Just like on this play. Yeah. Refs make mistakes all the time. Oh, So You think it was completely like And. You. There's no like gray. Like, oh, it could have went either way. It just depends on like how they say there's a hold on every play. I. Don't think That. This ERs illegal in Any way.


Okay personally keep this thing moving. Max Crosby shit Talks the tat man. What? What? He's got a lot of tattoos. He's tat Man. Oh, he ERs. He got bet he listen. He ERs tatted Max Crosby shit talk. Yeah. Caught on broadcast. How about it. Scream this ERs dope Bone. Nicks speak up. They don't fucking know. While Bow Nicks was audible on a third, And fourth in the second quarter. And I love a good shit. Talk I do ERs. This just good coaching. 'cause it did kind of look like at first, like everybody was waiting on to figure out what was going on. What do You mean? ERs a good coach on the, on the Denver side. What Do You mean? He ERs a good coaching for Max. For Max. Max ERs coaching him up.


Max ERs on coaching. Yeah, it's good shit. Talking I mean I. Think he's just observationally seeing That. The O line ERs like, what, What Do we doing? There's some funny stuff. That happens in the trenches. Like there ERs confusion. Sometimes And, sometimes like You. Just say exactly what's happening. And You Get this back And forth every once in a while. Like he's like just Paul You. Like, it's like there are Moments where it's like, You don't have time. Like You. Fuck Him. You can't say like Chico. Chico. What Was That? Chico? What pole? Dammit. Just, Just in the fucking crossbar. Here Was one. You know the radar defense when they're like moving around And.


They You don't know where the down guys are or anything. He was up there. He ERs at the, the clock was moving. He's like, ah, Just black Dude. That will be sometimes I. Pat just rambles up. Like he just spits it out. 'cause the the We're losing time on the clock. Yeah. And. I'm just like, what was That? What I can't hear And. I'm like, all I hear ERs like the formation. I'm like walking up. It's like, what the fuck play ERs this And. He'll just tell me what it ERs And. Then I'll look at the guy that's guarding me. I'm like, what Do I. Don't just fucking Tell them. Yeah, there'll be, sometimes you're like playing the team. That. You play a lot. And.


You're trying to mess with them. I'm like, where the slides going? So? I'd be like this. I'd be like, Hey, rip rip, rip. And. He ERs like what? He's like Rip God damnit. Now everybody knows You ruined It. Oh man. locker Room. Media policy. Let's Get to the real important stuff. And more important news around the league. The N-F-L-P-A has put out a statement about something That they shouldn't be worried about at all. Peter Gaza, The NFLPA has put out a statement about moving media interviews outta the locker rooms. And. A lot of players have since spoken up about, this has been something That guys have talked about for a long time. For those of You, That don't know after games or practices, there ERs a period of time.


That the locker room ERs open for media members to go in And, talk to players, interview them, ask You know what happened in the game. You know what's going on this week. And, whatever stories they're writing. And, There's no And to That. That ERs, meat Watch. I. Don't think That. That's why they're in there. This ERs what ERs being alleged ERs Alleged This ERs. Yeah. This ERs what I mean. This ERs what? ERs being guys are on the League. I. Suppose That. There's probably been a few Peters gazed over the ERs. That. Here's the statement. The NFL PA has issued. Tory Smith tweeted My good friend Tory Smith, former teammates who both champion And. Tory, wait To speak up for the league man. Tory Smith. If only y'all knew how awkward some of the mail reporters act.


Straight meat watchers. I'm not gonna lie. I, it's a little weird. That people are in there, but I don't mind. I never minded it You. Never minded. I. Listen, somebody wants my my dick. My dick ERs low on the totem pole. I'm not impressing anybody or doing anything. If You wanna look at it, go for it. Be my guess. They got nothing. It's not gonna impress You. It's gonna be, It's gonna make some babies, man. It's what it's gonna do. It's, It's efficient. It gets the job. Don especially, especially making girls, but it's not I. Don't know. I've never cared. I've never thought about it. And. I've never noticed anybody staring at it. We've been in locker rooms our entire lives. So. It's like I still. Remember going into the YMCA And, Cleveland Heights And seeing an old man's balls drag along a sauna.


I didn't know That the we were all of a sudden, Which ERs risky in two ways. Man. You can splinter those things. Yeah. I, remember it being Visually You. You can, You can see those things. Man. Sizzling I said I wasn't meat. G, it's a sa how hard it ERs not to look at an old man. Balls in a sauna. And. You. Can't not look at those And. There's nothing sexual about it, Tori. It's like, how the hell are those things hanging? That low. He's got a Point. Tori man looks like I. Think this was a, a hla an absolutely hilarious statement. And You know. Twitter. Twitter. You can You can just have some fun on there. Yeah. Kyle Ek also went out there on Twitter. He said, maybe we can keep Grant Khan I.


Think that's how You pronounce this guy's name. Sorry, grant for this from always hanging out around lockers while we're changing So. He directly, not only ERs calling out the collective group of porters, but Grant ERs catching strays here. Apparently he has been known to God. Shout out to Juice Man. I. Do think, Oh, I. Don't think this ERs the problem. That. It's being made out to be. It's So funny though. I really honestly think guys just don't want to be interviewed in the locker room. And, a lot of people are crying wolf right now to just try And, And Get. The reporters On the locker room, man. Hey, listen man, it sounds like everybody's having fun with it, man.


I don't. Yeah, I'm just like, I. Don't I. Don't think this ERs a big deal. I never had an issue with it. I think it's like it's So easy to just not show your dick to everybody. Like, Yeah, That seems like Putting a towel on or go into the bathroom. That, they aren't in like, they're not in the showers like Hey. I have to catch That ball. Like You can definitely not show your dick if You don't want to. Guys, it's not mandatory. That your dick's out while you're talking to these people. I think it's actually encouraged. Excuse You. Excuse me. Lower your pants please. I. Need to do my interview now. The fuck are we talking about Dude? I? Don't Dunno what the problem ERs. No, I've never had a problem with it. But I think.


I think it's actually encouraged by the NFL to be clothed. I. Don't think they encourage You to be naked. Hey Can You please show me That tush. Push. Reach down, And. Touch your toes real quick. I. Wanna see what this looks like? If you're self-conscious, there's definitely a way to not have your genitals out. Breaking NFL News. The jets announced they have parted ways with the head coach Robert Sala because he was the issue after five games this season. And a two And three record the much maligned Jets offense. Struggling And. They fire their defensive coach. Dude, jet. Jake, can we Get your thoughts? I'm here. I'm in The house. You're here. Nice.


You are our expert in the New York Jets coming. Cummings, And goings. What are your thoughts on the departure of head coach Robert Sala? Yeah, I mean everything's going great. This seems like a Well run organization. Nothing going wrong. It's crazy. I mean every year. I Get. My hopes up And every year. Five weeks into the season I'm in the same damn place. Yes, just Are You familiar with the definition of insanity? I've heard this once or twice. Yeah. I You. Know I. I love this team. There's nothing I can do, but You know. Maybe hiring a defensive head coach, forcing him to pick a quarterback he didn't want forcing him to fire the offensive coordinator than hiring a different offensive coordinator he didn't want.


Then firing him because the offense sucked. Might not be a good idea. Just my take. I'm dumb I. Don't know Football, but that's my thought. Well You Are think You. Were right in everything You just said. What ERs the what do You think should be the next head coach of the New York Jets? All right. s I got one name. I. I'm gonna fix the organization. You. Guys are gonna love it. He's a northeast Ohio Boy. Ooh, go Get. Mike Vrabel. Call Mike Vrabel today. I VR Get him in the building. So, he's Stack Guy can run a program. Listen, I don't hate That, I. I. Do they need I will say this. Not Right. Now just Don't do it. I, don't That. It's wrong. Next year or something. Yeah. Not right now. I don't Know That. Anybody's taking That job this year.

Coach Quote of the week. That's a good segment. A little context for this quote. During the Broncos Raiders game, cameras caught. Bo Nicks And. Sean. Peyton going at it on the sideline. Yeah. I. Think We could tell from body language. Sometimes coaches like this. Howard Mud used to purposely Get guys riled up just to see if they would like Tell 'em you're wrong, coach. He play mind games like That. Yeah. I think it's kind of fucked up, but I respect it. I mean we want talk about the best to do it ever. Tom Brady used to fucking Get. Pissed on the sideline. Yeah. Yeah. He show some aggression. I like, Listen, I don't have a problem with showing emotion. And the certain, it seems like Sean Payton doesn't have a problem with it either. Postgame Sean Payton asked about this moment.
