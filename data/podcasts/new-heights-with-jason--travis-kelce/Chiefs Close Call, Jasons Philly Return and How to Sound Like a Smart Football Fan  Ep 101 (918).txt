United Traces its roots to Varney Airlines. VAL. That's a, that's a big name upgrade to United. I'm not getting on Varney Airlines. Whoever's decision That was to go from That name to United Well. Wasn't I mean they should have got paid? It wasn't their founders. Probably. Walter Varney ERs s one That founded Varney Airlines in 1926 in Boise, Idaho. Ooh. s Idaho Gang. Okay Continental Airlines ERs a successor s Speed Lines, which Varney had founded in 1930. This got this Varney guy's a, he's a transportation pioneer. Mogul. He's a pioneer. Helix pioneer.

Oh, here We go. Here we, here we go. This ERs it. This ERs it. This ERs it. Okay. In 1927, William Boeing found a Boeing Air Transport I.

Pacific Air Transport, stout Air Services, Barney And, national Air Transport ERs, Well ERs, numerous equipment manufacturers at s same time. Jason s Energy was so good on March 28th, 1931. All of these airlines united to form United Airlines Incorporated.


It's what we came up with before. Yeah. So confirm it makes sense. All Right Right. Guess we can do s show now. Bonus Content update on Bonus Content. Next week we'll be dropping our first piece of content exclusively for our Wondery Plus subscribers. I Wondery. What it ERs they haven't even told us yet. Last week when you guys asked what you wanted for Bonus, Content And, here's a few of your suggestions from Emma. Fell in love ERs That like a lyric or something. Do we know Alright? right? Anyways, And it. I'm sure many Swifties And, tons of dads daughters I have no idea. Would love some new height show. Bonus. Content teaching Football concepts in an EL I five format. What? s What? s Hell ERs. EL I.


Five. What? ERs? EL. I. Five. Explain it like I'm five. Oh, Okay. Oh, Okay. All right. I mean, that's probably s one of s. Better ideas. That s 92 Percenters came up with. How would you explain Football to a 5-year-old? How do I do it to my How do I I it I mean? We're not very good at, at dumbing down Football. I've realized this. I Talk, I talk about it with Wyatt, but it's like, it's real dumb. Wyatt ERs five or will be in like three days. She a couple months here. Yeah, she's coming up. Not even him one month. So there's Uncle Tre. She doesn't really know. Football I. Don't even explain. Football to Wyatt. Yeah. I gotta figure That out. Nice Wyatt, when you try And. Ellie, How do, what do you think about Football?


Tell me how, what s rules of Football are. What? S your, Don't put your head through s railing. Don't you got stuck last time? Remember, don't do That. Okay Kai. Does Wyatt know s rules of Football? Where would you start if you were explaining Football to a five Yearold? Explain score. How scoring works. Yeah, but that's like, You gotta start with s downs. And scoring. Probably Alright. We're getting, we're getting Okay. We're gonna move on. We're gonna move on. This ERs going nowhere anyways. I'd love to be able to understand s NFL portions of podcasts, but a lot of this ERs hard to grasp ERs Someone with no background. s only problem with this ERs I feel like to explain Football it's easier. Don with visual Am I. Brandon. This Bonus. Content ERs audio Only, right? Audio only. Correct.


Yeah. So I just don't know. That. It's gonna be great if it's audio only. I think It's gonna be a little harder. Yeah. Yeah. But I think That. I. Think it's a good idea. AND. We can f We can figure a way to do it. Audio I. Think I. Think That makes sense. That's, That's like I said. I. Think this ERs s best option. Let's s Let's go to some other options. Okay. Sorry. Yeah. We. Have we have more options? I'm sorry. Yeah. We do have the Show to do Okay. Bonus. Content idea. Keep it simple. Give us s deleted footage. No, That will never happen because then we won't have the Show at all. Yeah. There's a reason it's deleted Me. And Jason will have nothing else to do. Yeah. On our Tuesday afternoons. And Or, or Mondays. Or Mondays. I will be, Yeah, we all will. Yeah.


I'll be driving right at s School every day. You'll be able to tell Wyatt exactly what Football ERs after That. All right, so not, that's not happening. Sorry. No, that's definitely not happening. AND Then. Big blue World. Phishing Jason doing food reviews on things he'd never tried before. Sounds like good Bonus. Content. Well. I mean That kind of leads us to this How about it. That ERs. That's actually perfect timing. Shout out to Kai. Yeah, for perfect timing. Well Don. Well. Don Kai. So last week you guys mentioned something about pumpkin spice lattes. And. Travis. And. I told you That. We've never tried 'em. So I figured I'd try one now. On s on s show. I Hope it's scorching hot. And it just fucking your tongue.


That's So this ERs something that's Nice about lattes, which I'd never have. I. Always drink black coffee. Yeah. s milk it. It's never scorching hot because you have s milk in there. So it's always drinkable. Watch. Now I'm kind of nervous. Burn 'em. Burn 'em. Not gonna lie. It's pretty good. Nice, give us your, your view. Tell tell us ERs if it was Bonus. Content. It doesn't taste like coffee. Okay. So not coffee. If you don't like s taste of coffee, I. Highly recommend this. I. Think that's all lattes. Yeah. I mean it tastes like a, it almost tastes like somebody melted.


What are those old school You remember those old candies, That you had in like grandma's house? s butterscotch cooked like little candies. Oh, baby s gold wrappers. Yeah, Kind of. It kind of tastes like if you melted That down and like a liquid form And then added some spiciness to it. That's kind of what it tastes like. I'm not gonna lie, I'd probably be and That I used to fucking pocket every single I'd take a handful of those. Candy zoos. Those ones. And. Then s little strawberry ones. That actually, where s wrapper made it look like it was a strawberry. Gosh, what ERs it about? Why do we try? Why are we reinventing candy when those have been around forever? Those strawberries. Nothing's top of That.


Strawberry. Dude. One of my favorites were s. s ly. Other Nerd. Clusters. Clusters. s s, s Cream, SAS s, light s. You know what I'm talking about? It was s orange AND. Like I. Think there was like strawberry creamsicles or cream savers. Lifesavers. Dude, they were so fucking good. I used to fucking house those things. Pumpkin spice latte. Tremendous. If you don't like coffee, highly recommend it. Nice. It's a really good way to have coffee without having to taste it. I got a feeling. Anything. Anything. That has like too much creamer in it. I. Just, I'm not I. Don't love it. I, just only drink black coffee. I've I. Don't add anything to it. And now like I. Just love s beans at this point. I love. s. s Earthiness.


Yeah. Don. Don't know what it ERs I think. It's just like, you know when you're so addicted to a substance like caffeine, That s faster, your brain recognizes That, you what you're drinking ERs just straight caffeine. s more. You're just immediately I mean it. I. Don't know That. It matters what coffee tastes like. I. Think my brain would just absolutely love it. It would trick my mouth and loving it. Does That make sense? Yeah. I mean you play tricks on your mind. All s time. Alright, Right? Well. Yeah. So maybe that's some Bonus. Content. We can do some food reviews. We're still figuring this thing out. They only want Jason reviews. They don't want anybody else's Well. Do you not wanna do food? You don't. You're not a big experimenter with Food. That. Dude. You, yeah, you And. You know how to get s best out of like s reviews.


I just me. I'm just like, no, your reviews are Great. You Just don't want eat it. I don't like it. We gotta get you reviewing some goat. Dude, I'm not eating a goat. Come on now. I'm not eating. Have I told That story on s podcast? Don? Don't know About what was That three ERs ago. I'm in Los Angeles, And. I'm visiting my brother AND. My brother makes a reservation at this restaurant called Lady AND. s Goat Heard great reviews from it. I I decided. I'm like, yeah, I'll go down there. And my brother proceeds to not eat anything. And complain about. There's so much Goat on s Table. I didn't think it was like Chick-fil-A where all they have ERs fucking chicken. They had a Right s. It was Goat Right, s five Star re, they had A lot other things.


It was a five star restaurant. And. Every single piece of protein s menu s food Was fantastic. s highly recommended it. s menu. Yeah. It was highly recommended to us. s menu. If You're goat forward or just a, you know, have a pal That ERs A something That resembles an advanced palate. You would really appreciate it. Adv, Advanced Palate. But Travis proceeded to just not eat anything. AND Eat Inn Out immediately after going this five star I. Think it was more so s fact That I knew That In-N-Out was right down s street. And I was just like, Why am I even eating this when Inn out's s right there. That double. Double ERs about to fucking kill any of this fucking goat I already know it's about to be so fucking good.


I do like some of s fine dining, but like, there's just some things That. You're not gonna top. Wouldn't you get your mindset on it. It's just like I s Hey. You wanna Go to s Go s. Fancy new brunch spot? Or do you wanna have a sausage Egg AND? Cheese McMuffin? I know exactly what I want. AND. It's s one That I. Don't even have to get out of s car to get, It's so true. Oh God.

All right, let's talk about some Football. That's s Right bold topics to wrap up. Week two in s NFL. start with Chiefs 26. Bengals 25. That's s right. Chiefs found a way to get it. Don. Trev, you got any initial thoughts you wanna talk about from s game? You guys found a way to get it. Don. Yeah. Close matchup, right? Yeah. I mean initial thoughts are We gotta play better. ERs an offense. s I think s defense ERs playing their asses off. Getting turnovers. Finding a way to make opposing quarterbacks, you know, uncomfortable. Yeah, Comfortable. And, And, AND. They're really making it hard for them to, to throw s ball. Downfield with s s type of pressures. That. We're getting AND And. How much, how good our coverage s right now.


And, I. Just think, you know, We have to, we have to match That accountability on s offensive side to really become another Super Bowl caliber team. I put That on me. You know, I think it starts with s leaders. I think it starts with, you know, making sure you, you're going with a right mentality. I didn't play my best. It it spreads if you don't fix it. So I gotta get That thing fixed, man. What's, what's going on in your head? ERs s game ERs unfolding. And. You know, pat tried to go to you twice early on with some incompletions on s interception. And. Then you only have one catch. Like, what's going on in your head? ERs this game ERs unfolding. Well. There's a lot of things That have to go right for anybody to get s Ball, you know, outside of our running back where you're literally just handing it to 'em.


If you, if you want Catch s Football one, it has to be a right play. Two, it has to be a right coverage. AND three, it has to be, you know, everybody doing their job upfront. And on s backend in terms of running s routes to, for everything to kind of match up. AND, AND be in sync. And, you know, it just, for whatever reason, these past two games, it hasn't gone That way for me. And, that's Football, man. I'm not about to sit here. And get frustrated about it. I used to get really, really pissed off. And And almost lose my cool a lot of s time from not having That success. Knowing I demand That outta myself. AND, I, demand, you know, That, I I. Just like to play s game to, to such a high level of accountability. That. It's just, it's, it's tough for me to, to deal with being mediocre or, or having stats.


That represent That. So I stopped caring about stats about four or five ERs ago. AND I just went out there. AND started just play free. And wanted to play for my guys AND. Sure enough, I think that's s better mentality. You, you think about it more play by play. AND, And, AND what your job ERs on That specific play. And I think moving forward. It's just, you know, how can I be better in those moments? You know, what's s issue? Am I not getting outta my route fast enough? Am I not, you know, you know, whatever s situation may be. It's all play specific anyways. But you know, you're always looking at s film, looking at s scheme, AND trying to, you know, perfect it more, And more each week. AND, you know, typically you see those, these kind of games earlier on AND.


Then you just, you keep trying to get better AND, better And more accountable for, for s Guys around you, man. Well, that's awesome. AND I. Think that's a testament to where you're at in your career. AND. Why s Chiefs just feel like one of s most unselfish teams in s entire league. But. yeah. Probably s most amazing stat in s game with s Chiefs. Win. s NFL ERs s teams are now one in a hundred And 51 since 1991 when s team doesn't get 300 yards on offense allows 21 Plus points on defense commits three Plus turnovers And convert 15% or less on third downs. It's insane.


Yeah, it's Pretty remarkable. You guys won this game. And, like you said, s defense, especially bone up in red zone situations. And Spags ERs. Dude. I mean he, he was so good last year. AND. It's gotten off to another great start for those guys. Yeah. Why, Why do s Chiefs besides s refs being on s chief side, why do s Chiefs always find a way to close these close games out? You know, I think always ERs s stretch. We Had a close game last last year. Yeah, exactly. AND AND. You guys almost pulled That one out freaking almost catch late down s middle might have ended That one differently, but anyways, great. Yeah.


And, it ERs I. Think That. When you have a veteran quarterback like Pat Mahomes, And, you know, he's just, he could, he always gives you a chance to win it. So you always have confidence. AND, you always have, you know, That in s back of your mind, That, you know, you can find a way to win this Football game. I think That helps I think Coach Reid being in s league so long And, his, his leadership, his his swagger, how he like, kind of leads s team on s sideline. You always feel like you're in it. You always know you got a chance. And, he's gonna put you in a really good position. At s end of s game. I feel, feel like We just have a team. That plays really Well together. When s when it, when s moment's bigger, you know, s guys don't really, you know, get anxious or they don't let s moment get too big. They keep their composure AND, they get more confident ERs.


s ERs s game goes on AND, it gets more intense. Yep. I just I felt That on s sideline. And, sure enough, it was a weird ending, man. It was a weird ending. There were flags on both teams late, obviously. s Bengals getting s s last of That with s s pass interference at s end. But we have to try to win beat beat teams earlier than, than That last Drive. And I. Think that's s biggest thing. ERs shout out to s s Bengals. Their defense, their s s players over there are just, you know, they're comfortable playing us And. They, they feel like they have a, a good idea of what we're doing. That's a, that's a huge challenge for us. s next time we play 'em, man. Absolutely. And, it's a matchup. That I was looking forward to because all of these contests between you guys, And s Bengals have been so close.


But s Chiefs win. They've even s record against Burrow. And s Bengals at three, And three five of s last six Cin s K C games have been decided by a field goal. That's how close these games have been. First half offense chiefs had a 16 play, eight minute 30 yard drive That ended in a field goal. Those I I mean Staggering. Man. It sucks putting all That work in And credit to s Bengals for bowing up at s end of it. But when you go all That way And, it just doesn't happen. It's frustrating. Very, very frustrating. Yeah. They also had two turnovers in s first half, but s play Chiefs fan loved to see was obviously s pat connection to rash rice on a 44 yard touchdown.


That tied the and 10 I That was a hell of a ball. 10 to 10. It was. It was a very impressive And. We got s clip right here for you. Check it out. Protection's good. Let he go. Creed. Gosh, perfect ball. Mm, I mean. Did he not think he was going to run past him? Was he not ready for That? Move I? Guess not. All right. After a small drought, s long touchdown passes back in KC Mahomes has already thrown ERs many deep touchdown passes of 20 Plus air yards this season. Two ERs s previous two seasons combined. Wow, that's an insane step. Very interesting. Between 2018 And 2022, nobody was bigger on s deep ball. Tyreek Hill might have had something to do with That, just probably I.


Wondery, who's four? I Wondery, who's now s best at it. S ERs. It's weird. Everybody. That Tyreek plays for ERs. s best quarterback perform. I'm holding you 44 deep touchdowns. Second most in That span, you know, was this s emphasis to bring s back to s offense. I really don't I mean I. Think I'm gonna answer this for you s way. Teams have been playing Kansas City And really s way teams have been playing. s NFL. If you look at quarterbacks across s league, all of s big plays for s Last two seasons have been way down. Ever since s air raid attack That Casey was implementing with Tyrek, And, That, other offense ERs start to do these big shot plays. And defenses have adjusted by playing these softer coverages a lot more too high looks.


AND making you take s underneath stuff. And really dink And. Dunk down s Field. AND. That's probably a bigger reason why these numbers have dropped off besides losing Tiger Hill, which ERs also a big part of it. That, And, I. Just feel like, I feel like there was a transition period where, you know, obviously you had, you always had big name cornerbacks since like Dion, Sanders, And, you know, Revis, AND, all AND, And, AND. Those like special guys. That would, That would get s s opportunities to try And lock up a wide receiver. One guy, That was there. There were only really like a handful of guys like That when I got in s league. Now I feel like corners are getting a lot better.


Corners are start to understand, you know, what kind of routes, how s how guys are released. And. I just feel like s defenses are evolving a lot. AND, on top of what you're saying, you know, everybody's kind of just keeping That umbrella over s s back end of s defense. And kind of limiting those big, big plays. Downfield absolutely ERs, Well ERs s second level guys, s sec. If those guys are backing up s second level guys are, are getting a little bit more depth. And running backs, And s underneath routes. You know, everybody s defense ERs like taught to like rally to those tackles instead of giving up s. Huge plays, man. Absolutely. And. It's something that's s a kryptonite to That, which ERs why we're seeing it a lot in s NFL Right now. ERs running s Ball. Yeah. And, you guys. That, we mentioned That eight minute, 32nd field goal drive.


First half you guys were running s Ball all over him. It felt like, yeah, you were really moving s Ball in s ground. Well. And. Maybe that's why it opened up. That. Big play for Rashe. Maybe they're like, Hey, We. Gotta try And. Stop this. Let's go to a single high look. Finally Bengals took a 16 oh lead, or 1610 lead and the half AND then coming out, second half We. Get right to it. We a thick six. Oh yeah, one. Yay. I'm A big fan of s thick six. Even though Trav was wide open too. It's Okay. We're happy for s big fella to get s touchdown. Always happy when a big fella gets in. He hit it too. You see his dance? Yes. Oh yeah. He had a great celebration, man. I don't know what he calls That, but he was getting it.


Marshall Newhouse on, on on x I was like, that's a, that's more than three pumps. That's a, that's a, that's a Penalty. That's a penalty. s old key And peel. Yeah. On second And goal on s one yard line, pat connects with O Lyman, Juana Morris for s touchdown. And s Chiefs take a 6, 17, 16 lead. Leo Chanel lined up next to Mahomes in s backfield. How about That. s guy does everything. He's just a Football guy, man. Yeah, man, whatever you need, he gets it down. Look At That stance, dude. It's what ERs That stance. He's like, ready. Perfect. It's like a four point stance. Yeah. Looks Like he's playing goal line defense right there. He's just about to bear crawl. He's about to bear crawl. and somebody Walk us through an oline like eligible tackle play Well. You don't always have him in s game plan.


You know, it's, you kind of, it ERs one of those things where it's a, it's a play off of all s running And, all s big boy stuff. That. You do, 'cause you bring in extra old lineman to run s Football. I mean you don't bring, bring him in to throw him a touchdown. Well. That's what you want him to think. There You go. There you go. Yeah. So And one ERs athletic enough. And. AND smooth enough with s Hands. AND. Sure enough, he, he even said to me right before s play, he said, man, I was getting excited because I realized nobody was covering me. Yeah. I was just like, s fact. That, you actually know when you're covered. And when you're not covered. ERs s tackle, that's pretty good stuff. It's a big man move, right? When you bring a, when you bring a linebacker in And, a extra offensive lineman.


I'm pretty sure it's a big time indicator for s defense. That, you're running s Football. So it's a hell of a play call. Hell of a call a draw up or a play call, a draw up at s at a right time. You Gotta be a little sneaky at s Tackle. You can't just run straight out. They know. Oh no, he ran straight out. Oh, he did? Yeah. Nevermind. Yeah. Nix That. He said speed kills Jason didn't, I'm gonna be bluff. and the pipeline, he didn't bluff blocking at all. All eyes were in s backfield. They thought we were running it s whole time. Well, You mentioned s celebration. Let's check out Morris here. Looking good. Looking good. Bigg fella. Looking good. Looking good. S next Chief drive ended in I mean has to be s most impressive interception I've ever seen in my life.


Dude, Don don't know if I've seen one. Li I definitely haven't seen one end game like this before in my life. That's one of those, when, when somebody like hits hits like a a, a home run in baseball, or they hit one all s way to s warning track And. Somebody just goes up, And robs him, AND, then s s s batter then tips his cap to s guys. It's like, dude, I'm not gonna lie. That was That Shit was sweet. Impressive. That's a hell of a fucking play, man. Yeah. I don't know That. Anybody could have like I think everybody was just like, wow. You know what? Well, Don, Well Don. Respect. Respect. One of s reasons. It's so eye-catching ERs That. Most of s time on this sideline with your left shoulder being s outside shoulder. A one-handed grab would be like, more like grabbing it with your left hand.


Do you know what I mean? s Spin, right? Makes it just insane. Yeah. Insane. Phenomenal. Pick Right here from Cam Taylor. Brit AND. Then s fourth quarter defense comes up. Big s beginning of s fourth quarter. Joe Burrow sacked by Mike. Dana. Shout out. Just got I. Think he, he just got Mike. Dana. Yes sir. Dana, sorry. Did he, he got a contract extension this year. Right. Yes he did, man. Yes He did. We talked about him being Very worthy. Very worthy of, similar to what you're talking about with Leo. Chanel able to do a lot. Mike, Dana does a lot on That. Defense moves a lot all over s place. Forces a big fumble. And, it was recovered by safety. Ari Connor And returned for a touchdown. That's always Nice Two seven, baby.


right? Dude, it ERs, especially at That point in s game. Huge, huge for, for s defense. I mean you, you always set those, those expectations before s season on how many, like how many special teams scores you need, how many defensive touchdowns you need And right now, our defensive playing ERs, so goddamn good for them to put up six points. Like That in such a tight game. And such a crucial game, especially with us not playing s way That. We think We should on s offense or living up to our potential ERs an offense right now. I think obviously we're, we're leaning on That side of That Ball. Right now pretty heavy. That was a Huge play, huge turning moment in s game. AND no shocker.


s guy who kind of initiated this whole fiasco. start And was Chris Jones. He's been really good surprise, surprise through s first two weeks, applying a lot of pressure. He split two on That one. Check him out. Look at him in s backfield ERs. This just expected from Chris at this point. Yeah, you know what I mean? Like even in s first week, I mean he was like taking his, they had some new guys playing for Baltimore. He was just kind of moving around on Hey. Whoever wants it can come get it. Yeah. It's a frustrating day. No, no. You're supposed to be s three technique. Not you're supposed to be over here. You're be over there. You do it all. Man. Per Next Gen stats, Trent McDuffy aligned across Jamar Chase on 17 to 38 routes. 45% of s time, including four routes.


And Press coverage. McDuffy allowed one. PR reception for four yards on two targets. ERs s nearest defender against Chase. We had to go Trent. Solid game. Trent. It's really great Football player. Our entire defense ERs really playing great Football man. Hats off to s to them. Keeping us above floating, man. We just gotta, We gotta start playing up to our potential on offense. 'cause we got s Guys, we got s ammo. We just gotta get it Don, man. Well. It's always fun when you win games, AND, you're not playing your best. Yeah. That's when s that's when everyone says it's a good one to learn from. Yeah. You know? Exactly. Yep. It's a good one to learn from. That sets us up for s game-Winning Drive. That's s Right Chiefs Get s Ball back with two minutes. And, 35 seconds. AND. You guys are in fourth AND, sixth situation with 53 seconds left on s clock.


Pat competes a deep pass rash. She rices, but it comes back. Trey Hendrickson was wreaking havoc all game along. And. Yeah Man. He was, he was fired up at s End of s Day. Man, you can't put it in s Ref's. Hands That late in s game. And. That's for both of us. Both. Both sides of s Ball. You know, obviously you wanna play physical, you want to make sure you make That play, but at at, if you're gonna put it in s ref's hands, it's I mean. That, you're playing with fire. It ERs what it ERs. You're just playing with Fire man. That's why ERs an offense. We gotta make sure That, we don't put ourselves in a position to where we have to have to score at s end of s game. Obviously, we still feel comfortable And, confident That, we can get it Don, but if We can win s game before That, I mean, let's, let's keep it out of s ref's hands.


Let's keep it out of, you know, s hands of just fate or, or things just not going our way. I think it's, that's s mentality. You gotta have AND. Did we get lucky? Yeah, We got fortunate. That, they threw s flag at s end of at s on That. Fourth. AND 16. Yep. AND, I, I, I would love to make sure That, we don't get ourselves in a situation like That again. Yeah. Especially two minutes. There's when, whenever you're in a two minute drill penalties sacks, like these things are just like crucial That, you don't do Easier said than Don when you're trying to block Trey Hendrickson. But yeah, That one almost killed you guys. AND, you guys get bailed out. Fourth And 16 with 48 seconds left. Pat Targets rash. She writes again.


But this time somebody arrives a little early. I don't even know how this ERs controversial. I really don't like I. Get That. People are frustrated with s officials. And s Chiefs I guess but I mean you can't run through a receiver's back. And can't it? And make a play on s Ball. I really don't, it's can't Do it. Just like on s play before That, you can't put your hands in someone's face while they're rushing you. You Can't do it. Exactly. It's s same thing. It's hands of s face, AND. Then there's a, there's a pass interference. AND. It ERs what it ERs. But yeah, I can see how everybody's upset because it's, nobody Likes a fourth down conversion. That essentially ERs given to s Chiefs. But s reality ERs like, what do you want s official to do?


What do you want him to do? You want 'em to not call pass interference. Don't run through s guy's back I. Don't know what, Like I said, ERs ERs. Chief ERs ERs our office. Like When it's like when it's close, when it's close, I get not calling it, this wasn't even close. Like I don't really know what we're talking about. Yeah. I, I. Hear I agree. s game should be called tighter down. s Stretch. AND We should avoid like questionable calls. But when it's to s point, That s guy can't even make a play on s Ball. And touch it. Like, what are we talking about? You said it, man. I'm not going to argue for, for this point. I'm just gonna go ahead. And. Say That I. Think We need to fucking keep ourselves outta That situation. So. we don't have to rely on s on s on s officials to, to make That fucking call.


But sure enough, they made s call Harrison Bucker comes to Save s day, yet again. Mm. Harry for s win absolutely nails a 51 yard field goal. All of us had a lot of confidence in him, but always, always, there's always just That, That lingering feeling. You know, you're just sitting there like, come on Harry, come on. You gotta do it again for us. Big guy, please. And. Sure enough, he, he came up big for us again, man. Absolutely. Chief started out two AND. Oh, some disappointing news. Following s game. Or maybe this was out right before, but Hollywood Brown was put on ir. It was, it was before s game. It was right around game time. So Hollywood Brown was put on IR before s Game. And. Unfortunately, Isaiah Pacheco ERs now injured. And I was gonna miss about six to eight with s, what was it?


Tibia or Fibia? Fibula something. One of those two. I. Think it's s Yeah, it's Fibia one. It's One of those. Yeah. That was an aggressive hit. Even when it happened. I was like, oh my gosh. You could see That. He just had a guy in his legs. And. He just kind of got folded over top of it. But hopefully Pop comes back. That sucks, man. Isaiah was, he's been playing unbelievable Football man. High energy. Just a guy you love. You love blocking four. You love playing s game four. You love playing s game with man. It's just, you know, And all, all time. Teammate of mine, man. I love Pop And. It's, it just, it sucks. That, you know how Well he's playing And, how comfortable And, how fast he's moving right now with s Ball in his hands.


That, he has a setback like this, but I expect him to be back better than ever in 68 weeks. Man on S next week. You guys have s Falcons in Atlanta. Trav s, last time you played s Falcons s Chiefs won both games. Actually you've played 'em twice in your career only. Wow. 2016 And. 2020 Chiefs won both games. s last time you played s Falcons in Atlanta, it was at s Georgia Dome in December, 2016. Eight receptions for a hundred And 40 yards. That's a good day trail there. We go. Ooh. Damn. It's been That long since I played in Atlanta. Oh, I. Guess I had a few preseason games there, but I haven't played a regular season game in Atlanta yet. Yeah, That's crazy. That Man. Yeah, I. Remember That one I.


Think That was s s first. My clause, my cause my cleats game actually. Oh Wow. How about That. Yeah. That's how, that's how long ago That thing was. Yeah. Alright, Right, Well. Good luck in Atlanta. Shout up to Eric Barry in That. Pick six Down in s A TL. Atlanta loves me. Right now a L. Yeah. LeBron instead of s game. Patrick Mahomes has 2004, 2 24 hour completions in 98 career starts, AND surpassed Matthew Stafford for s most completions by a player in his first 100 career starts in NFL history. It's a good company. Yeah, Definitely good company. We also gotta talk about your historic streak. Trav I know s game didn't go s way you wanted to ERs Far ERs perceptions And. Unfortunately it ends s longest NFL streak in history with a player receiving at least three catches.


That's s right Sunday marked s first game since September of 2018 where Travis Kelsey did not get at least three catches. It snaps a streak of 100 And 14 games s longest streak by any player in s NFL history. Not only ERs, That s longest streak s next closest ERs. Our our guy Antonio Brown with 81 Mahomes ERs. Quote, We play two opponents. We We play a lot. AND. They have a plan on how they're going to account AND defend Travis. But ERs s season goes, he's going get his catches And. He ERs going to get his yards. So Yeah, And I could have played better, man. It ERs what it ERs. Alright. right. Could have played better, could have ran better routes, could have got out my brakes a little bit faster. No, Hendrix was on one AND.


It's just, you know, you, you see things, you know Monday morning quarterback. You see things better after s game. AND realize how you can play better And be better for your teammates. And. Sure enough, I've always had That accountability. I've always been my worst critic. And, I'm going, you know, remain my my worst critic I. Think That That I can improve a lot for my guys. And be there for Pat in in a lot of different situations. But like I was saying earlier, it takes a lot of things to go right for somebody to get s Football. Yeah. I'm just fortunate. That coach Reed AND, this offensive staff has has given me That opportunity. And, you know, has s confidence That. I'll be able to get it. Don. I. Love it. Love it.


Let's talk about our next partner, AG G one, AND. If you're Wondery, why you still have a bit of a dad bod after working your core at s Gym?

They actually Well, they wanted more of Jason Kelsey because they wanted to not only see you hype up those birds before s Game, but they wanted to see you answer all Dumb Questions. Yeah, that's s right That. They had S Atlanta had to deal with me for four hours before things got rough for s Eagles And. They were like, oh no, come back in s booth. Jason. Where you at now? Jason, Answer us. What? What happened? And. Rightfully so. Listen, it was I Wanna apologize to Falcons fans watching because I understand That, you just had to watch just a Philadelphia celebration in a, in a parade of a former player coming back home.


We all deserve to see That That was what people wanted to see. ESPN did a great job. Yeah, I'm just gonna say I wanna apologize but I'm not going to because it was fucking awesome. I'm just gonna let you know it was a lot of fun. That's s s s first one. I. Let's get, and it s first time I mean How crazy ERs it s First time I'm back in s building, I'm commenting on a game. Shout out to Roger Goodell for scheduling That one or whoever was in charge at at NFL headquarters for making That happen. Even we're gonna get to it, but before s Game, being out in s parking lot. s s s s countdown, being up in s s booth with, with Joe And, Troy I mean it was, it was really, really awesome for me. So selfishly, I am like just beyond happy.


That That was kind of how I get to remember my first time being in s Link. Not ERs a player. It ERs so cool man At s same time, I I. Fully understand why a bunch of Atlanta people hate my guts. s Right now. So I apologize, Well. Let's get to it baby. Jason's Monday Night Homecoming. That's s Right. We went to back to Philly, headed back to s Link for s first time since he was playing there. s for a Little Eagles Atlanta Monday, night Football Action AND. Just like any homecoming, it was about s pre-game. And boy oh boy. Did you not disappoint And by s way? s Philly did not disappoint. 'cause you weren't s only one there.


It was an entire showing of how faithful those birds are. AND, how excited they are about this Football team. AND. How good this Football team could be. And. You made it to s Eagle's tailgate. That's s right And made sure to handout some garage beers. I. Remember what section, what I think it was like C two or something like That I. Can't remember where this was in s parking lot. But I'm surprised you remember any of this. Jason. I thought you were gonna black out. I've seen those dance moves before. That. We're about to get to And. Typically those are I was still over. I know. You don't believe me. No. I was not drinking until a S. I was Those knees. Those knees Don after I open. s S moves at s end of it. I promise you Don. Don't know how I did That. 'cause I've never Don The Show. Everybody s know you don't have rhythm until you have like Travis 10 beers. Travis Hey, I'm letting you know right now. I could tell by s by s way.


You were talking in s third quarter in s booth. That, you had been in s up down roller coaster Stop of being I, a rollercoaster being drunk since about noon. No zero. Zero beers. Dude I could tell you you had, Do you know how hard it was to throw garage beers? I threw probably a a hundred beers. I'm not exaggerating from a pickup truck. My arms, my arms fall off. And didn't drink. Fall off. Do you know how hard That was? S feet. I. Don't think you've ever accomplished before. I'm a professional. Travis. Don. Don't mess around. I. Respect it. No, this tailgate was awesome. A bunch of these guys had been to s golf outing, right? So, you know, Dallas sucks. Maniac, Malloy shoulder pad. Sean AND, my guy, dfi. All these guys had had been around And.


I wanted I. Mean. Man, I've seen these guys at all these events throughout s ERs, they've cheered me on. I. Wanna be out there with these guys? Don don't know how we got to like throwing garage beers. I. Think I was like I got up on s top of s truck where they were smoking an alligator. Which ERs pretty gnarly. I don't know if you've ever seen a smoked alligator covered in Bacon. Who? Fuck did Philadelphians get an alligator? I? Don. Don't know. I. Don't know. That. I. Think That. They just kind of do it. I. Oh yeah, I. Remember I? Remember having an alligator one time. AND. It was when We Fried. Alligator when We were down in Florida. Florida, yeah. We went to like That County Fair down in Florida. And. They had Gator nuggets. Yes. and they were delicious. They Were fucking phenomenal. Yes. AND. That was s First time I was like, damn, I ain't know people were out here eating Gator like this.


That's what we're doing down here. We're just catching gators. Like we're catching fish. Just going out there. And fucking reeling them onto s boat. AND putting 'em on a fucking, putting 'em over a fire. That's S Right. Very interesting. Well. They've smoked it all day. It, it was delicious. They covered, they like stuffed it with like cheese, And, whatnot. Covered it in bacon. Oh, I was getting different pieces. I was getting s tenderloins. I. Can't even on this. I had a piece of s s cheek Right off of s freaking face of it. It kind of taste, it just tastes like lobster almost. It's like, it was delicious. It was a very good what s Fuck. It's Kind of like a lobster chicken I. Don't want to hear That. You're ruining my day by telling me this shit. It was good. Just letting you Know I'm in on fried, just about fried anything.


Fried Gator ERs probably ERs. Far ERs. I'll go on s Gator train. Alright Right. But either way, sounds, sounds very eventful. 'cause you don't always have Gator at tailgates up in s Northeast. It's not a regional delicacy. But either way, it certainly was a, an event. They also had cheese steaks. They had a bunch of food at this tailgate. It was incredible. s fans were, and it, everybody's getting ready for Monday Night. Football. AND. We just so happened to have like a thousand garage beers. So I just started putting 'em in Coozies And chucking 'em like grenades To people. Yeah, because Coozies are like, it's like bubble wrap. It's safe. I was, I was basically, yeah, exactly. I was, I was basically playing jackpot with an entire parking lot of Eagle Eagles Fans. Full beers throwing full beers Might ERs Well be assault.


I mean none of them. Dude. Dude. I was making eye contact. I almost took out a Jeep window, but I was making eye contact. Crushed s moon roof. It might be cracked, but it was electric. Dude Throwing beers further than like 20 yards, 15 yards ERs. Dude, That thing you, that's dangerous. No, It's got s CZI on it. It's, it's wrapped in S Cozy. Yeah. There you go. Nice little. Yeah. It Finally, it reminded me of s honestly, it reminded me of s parade time, because when you're on s Parade, every s parade comes around. Yeah. You're on s bus floating. S people are throwing you beers. So it felt like reverse, reverse. It's s now it's time to throw s beers. s other way To catch this wrath, Dude. But I was making eye contact. There was some, I'm not gonna lie. There's some talented people in That parking lot to catching beers.


I don't know if they can catch footballs, but if some of these guys can catch Football ERs, good ERs. They catch beers. They might wanna try out for s Eagles. Fucking idiot. We also gotta look at some new moves. Jason showing off some moves. One move. That ERs actually new to me. I've only seen you hit one of these two Moves before I told you. That. Kylie I said, that's a new Move. That ERs 100% a new move. Kylie I haven't seen That one yet. Kylie said it's s same ERs s stop move. She said it's just a different variation of your stomp. Yeah. Which means it's a new move. s s this stomp though. s running. s Running, man. It wasn't my best running man. I've been better at running, man. So Those knees are getting off That.


That's what I'm saying. I still these knees. And. This kind of bounce doesn't work unless you have like 10 beers. Dude, I'm you. Those, these are shattering. If you're fucking doing it with no I. Didn't know what to what happened. ERs fucking fuel in you. What happened ERs? We were supposed to be on That stage to start Countdown. And. I walked over there way too early. Guys gotta do I. Like a I had to kill I had to kill 30 minutes before s show started. AND. I'm just up there with these DJs just standing there. I'm like, I, gotta do something up here. I can't just stand here like a jamoke. I gotta bring s energy. Oh, you brought it I. Don't even know what I'm doing, Dude. It's, it's cool.

Looks like you're like, you know when they put shoes on a Dog for s first time? Yeah. They're just like fucking trying to figure out how to step in those things. Yeah, dude.

It doesn't make any sense. s sound doesn't I mean? It doesn't make it That much better. It's still ridiculous. But God damnit. That's so good. Well. It was so good. Even Pat Mahomes had to get a little comment in there on X saying, with a lot of s crying emojis go crazy than Jake Kel And That ERs.

Nobody else can do these fucking moves. I promise you. Jason ERs s only one And. You look good doing it because of s jumpsuit. Big Dom gave you, hooked you up with s South Philly. Tuxedo s Green Velo. Tracksuit. Did you feel ERs Italian ERs?


You looked Dude, I. I. Don't I feel like, you know, when you dress up in a uniform, you feel like more official. right? I felt like more official. That's exactly why I dress up. That's why I dress up. That's S feeling. I get. But you dress ERs like in like a unif. Like if you dress up ERs like a police officer, you kind of feel like you're two. Right? Yeah. But a good two piece. A two. A good two piece that'll that'll make you feel like you're in in costume. Yeah. When I was, when I was dressed ERs a south Philadelphian in, in this velo jumpsuit, which by s way, velour not very breathable, dancing around like That Alex at all. Full sweating. I mean Marcus Spears had me covered with s s towel on s set.


He was like, Hey, take this. You're gonna, you're gonna S fellow big sweater. Yeah. He knows. He knows what it's about. He knows But. yeah. Dom hooking it up. We had to sew on these Italian flags 'cause it was really an Eagles tracksuit. But you can't have, they didn't want me to have like a Eagles thing on which I get And. I don't wanna show any bias. We didn't do That a lot. We didn't. So they put We, we Didn't show You were very biased. That Day. We Put We. We That's actually over S Eagle patches are way too much s chance. You can do s chance all day though. Yeah. You can actively Be cur. You could s And I. Like you could actively be cheer Cover s Patch for s Eagles in s booth. Oh, he's in. Yes, He got in right.


I'm like, oh yeah. I'm not supposed to say That. So good. I. Think s Italian flags. Really set it to another level. Had some Nice chains on. It was, it was a fun look. You look great. Shout out to Big Dom for getting you some swag. AND. A lot more Shout out to big Dom for everything. Then we got to see why Jason ERs making Monday Night Countdown. s greatest show on tv. And. Dude. It was, it was, it was fun seeing you in your element. But even last week, man, it's cool to see That. You are now one of s guys That ERs driving s love of sports. Yeah. You know, I think it was so cool to hear That. You were getting offered by everybody.


And. You were kind of torn between a couple different networks. But when you chose ES, espn, I'm like, in my head, I'm like, man, he's gonna be like a Chris Berman. He's gonna be like a SVP. He's gonna be like a rich eyes. AND s growing up And fueling That love for s Sport of Football, And, I. Just, you know, I I was so fucking proud of seeing you doing it last week in San Fran. AND. Even this being in your moment with Fletcher Cox. And And. Nick Foles. Yeah. Baby. Doing s Eagles champ before s game to even being in s Booth with Aikman, And AND Joe Buck. Two legendary guys in s booth. And obviously a Hall of Famer. AND Aikman. It's just, it's so cool seeing you in this moment. AND seeing you in this next phase of life in Football.


And. Man, I just couldn't be proud. More proud of you brother. s shit's fun. Absolutely, man. It's fun to Watch. I I I. I, man. I. I. Appreciate it. I. Really do I. Think first week. Definitely nervous this week. There was so much going on. I was nervous a little bit. It's interesting being up there. You're trying to say a Right thing. AND get things, you know, formulate responses in real time. It's difficult. There's a whole new respect That I have for anybody. That does this like, it's, it's difficult. s pre-show ERs difficult s Booth. I. I mean Joe And. Troy going up there with those guys was trying to fit in And. I really? I was like, man, I, I, Don. Don't wanna, you don't wanna overstep. Yeah. I can over Right. You don't wanna overstep. But also there's a chemistry between calling a game with s play.


Byplay, And, s Color guy, And. They have it down pat better than anybody. And tell me if I'm being an idiot. Yeah. I don't, you know, it's like, it was very, very humbling me up. Coach Me up. Yes. Coach me up, dude. I'm, I'm here to get coached. I don't want to I I I I can definitely respect That. I Feel like that's I took That mentality this off season. And a lot of s different Don don't know active Roles. And. Yeah. Acting all That shit. Yeah. Everything That I did in s off season. I was like, yeah, just let me not fuck this up. Yeah. Coach me up. Tell me how to, how to go about this AND. You know, I think that's s that's s a Right mentality. But at s same time, man, trust your gut, man. You're, you're fun ERs hell to listen to. AND ERs much ERs s Falcons fans probably didn't wanna see you chanting Eagles.


And doing all That. You can't tell me they weren't enjoying That shit, man. 'cause you do it in a Right way. I think they get it. They get That. I was an Eagles fan. I mean I. It's a fortune for them on a national broadcast. That. They, but it was one time. Right. We're gonna get back to, you know, I'm, I'm try And. I really wanted to offer unbiased opinions for s Falcons who I thought played a fantastic game. And. We'll get to That shortly, but this was really cool to, to be back in Philadelphia. It was awesome. And, this ERs probably s one chance I got to kind of solidify my retirement ERs a player And to be up on stage with Fletcher Cox. s guy. That retired s same year ERs. Me, Nick Foles, I mean s guy. That I won a Super Bowl with Super Bowl, MVP And, then all s fans.


Like, it was, it was really, really fun moment. So I can't thank ESPN enough for I. Don't know, man. Just like letting this all happen. I don't know. It was like, No I. Hear you like, yeah, I hear you. It seems a little, it seems a little much. But they definitely, they looked out for you. And I. Think it was a great look for ESPN And. It made, it made everybody really excited to watch Monday Night. Football. Not only yesterday or last week, but in s future. Man, you guys are doing a great job. AND. Don't want to not give credit where it's due. SVP, Ryan Clark, AND Spears, I mean. Those guys are s fucking best man. I, love seeing all you guys throughout s game. And throughout s s evening. Talk about Ball And. You guys always have great takes on it, man.


So shout out to s Monday night crew. We also had, speaking of Eagles fans, That, you were just thanking That. Were there, bro. Big Rod Dunphy, s Su Eagles super fan on stage. AND Jason Jason forced him s Chess bump. You forced him. I heard you on s mic. You forced him. You said, no, we're doing this. Do We. This We talked about it beforehand. We were both excited about it. AND I was just calling. Like, come on, we're doing this. We're getting it. Don dude. Dumb fe Best course Me said, get it outta s way. Get it outta s way. You move iconic. You move. You ready? Let's do this. Oh, Nice three point stance by s big guy up top. And, ah, man. In quotes from Big Dumpy.


Fucked my whole knee up. But it was so worth it. Yeah. It's not funny. He's, he's s funny thing was he texted me, AF I. I was asking about him. And. 'cause I I didn't know That happened until afterwards. I see on Twitter. He has also tweeted That. He, he waited until after s game to get it checked out. Dude. He Stayed s whole game. That's Gotta be a good sign, right? I can't lead this ERs this ERs first Monday night. Football gave me it's Bird home opener. I can't miss this Wood. S guy's fucking electric Said it was so worth it. AND. Yeah. I mean it was an electrics chest bump. It's a big dude. s big dude. Chest bump bro. Right? Chest bump. s fucking Philly super fan with s fucking Phillys fanatic Snout over his B Are.


you kidding me? That thing was awesome. That was That. Was I mean? I? I hate That. He got hurt on it. But he's a fucking legend though. Well. Moving on to s to another part of s Pre-game show was your interview with Jalen Herz. Yeah. Baby. You guys just, it was awesome to see s interview. 'cause you, you guys just have so much respect for each other. AND. You guys could tell That you, everyone could tell how close you guys were when you played And. You're just so appreciative of each other's, you know, work ethic, And, leadership, And, Don. Don't know. It was just really cool, man. I don't Know. I mean he was more loose than I was. I'm in s interview And, he's calming me down. Which ERs just like, you know, Don. Don't know I. Think, like you said, there's so much familiarity there.


I think he knows That. I'm s one who's doing something. He's Don a thousand interviews. Yeah. There ain't nothing new for him. I'm doing s I'm now I'm on s opposite side asking these Questions And. He, he kept s light for me. So it was awesome. It was, it was really cool to chop it up with him. Yeah, It's a different world. It was interesting. It was weird being in That Bubble AND sitting across from a, a teammate. Yeah, It's pretty crazy. It'll get More normal. But I thought it was great. s Tone That, he had freaking made AND. It was just like when we played Don. Don't know man. He's just got a way about him. He really does. Well. Let's get and the game a little bit then. s Eagles 21. Falcons 22 on Monday Night. Football. Not s way. s Eagles planned it, And it got it.


Came down to a, a play called here. You know, a play called there or a big play made here or there. And. It just, you know, it just didn't go their way down. s Stretch man. Falcons come back. And steal s win on a Kirk. Cousins's two minute drill. Ending with s TD Pass. s Drake, London AND obviously. That That, Jalen Hertz's interception there after That with just seconds left. s initial thoughts on s Game, brother. Listen, it was a great game. It was. It Was. It was, yeah. It Was a fun to watch. Think It was both offenses kind of struggles early on. And started to catch their stride right towards s end of s first half And. Then in s second half, it felt like both offenses were functioning. Really Well. s offensive lines of both sides really controlled s line of scrimmage.


I felt like I. Think in particular. I gotta give Atlanta. Like you watch That first game. That Atlanta played against Pittsburgh. AND, TJ Watt, And Cam Hayward were, were given That offense. A lot of issues. Everybody's talking about. Kirk Cousins And. He's not s same quarterback. He can't move anymore. There was a lot of narratives out there after week one. Yeah. Well prove That wrong. AND, they, they got him up under s Center. Did him, got him and doing a lot of things. That he's probably more familiar with throughout his career. But really s big thing was, bro, they were running, they were running s Ball. And. They were giving him a lot of time back there. Yeah. And I. Think That That offensive line. That was a big bounce back game for Atlanta in particular.


They're running outside zone. I mean That was a clinic tape of outside zone. Yeah. Cutting on s s Backside got a really mean. It was a battle of two really good fucking running backs. Yeah. AND really good offensive lines. They get after it, man. I, keep looking at s Eagles. Offensive line And. I'm like, dude, since you left, they have become s biggest offensive line in s World. Well I. Think they were already enormous But. yeah. Add mackay Beckton. Holy shit. It's A big wall. Every single one of 'em. Yeah, it's unbelievable. Yep. Eagles were without their star wide receiver. AJ Brown with s Hamstring, unfortunately. But Jalen Hertz played pretty Well up until That last Drive. Man Jalen went 23 to 30 for a 183 yards And, one touchdown 85 yards on s on s ground with a touchdown.


Saquon And, his Philly debut. Although he had That That That drop there at s end. A hundred AND 16 total yards, which ERs exactly what you expect outta him. s guy can do it, can beat you every single way. I don't see him dropping That ball ever again in That situation. He's such a good player, man. It, it kind of rips your heart out when something like That happens. He's such a big piece for s Offense. AND That was an underrated thing. That really didn't get discussed at s end of last year. You know, obviously we struggles with s Blitz. And That was s main narrative. s last two games of s season. But another big piece was AJ Brown's hurt. AND. I. Just think he's, he's an equalizer man. He ERs one of those guys. Al Sean, Jeffrey used to say it. Even when I'm covered, I'm not where like at any time there's, he's there.


AND. You can throw That ball up to him. AND. He can make a play on it. And, you know, it opened it up a little bit for Smitty, which I. Don't know That. I've had a teammate, That I respect more in my career in Philadelphia. I mean there's guys, I, respect ERs much. But Slim ERs just, he's just such an awesome dude. So happy That. He got A little bit more, it was awesome seeing him eat last night. Yeah. Yeah. He was, he was killing it. Yeah. Jalen I thought was a lot more composed. You know, I thought he played great AND. Even s rushing yards like s Scrambles. It felt like he was trusting s Pocket more. Staying in there, AND. Then he would push up when it wasn't there. And. It just felt like, you know, he, he was doing a lot better throughout s game.


I know. Everybody wants to talk about s last interception at s end of s game, you're pushing to make a play. He's getting hit while he ERs throwing it. I thought. That. He was I. Thought he was really good in his decisions. He made AND his comfort. And poise in s Pocket in week two. I thought it was impressive. I'm right there with you, man. I was I just watched s game today. Knowing That. We played s s Falcons this week. Watch s start to finish. I thought he played fucking awesome thought. He made, he made some unbelievable throws, especially over s middle And tight windows. His touchdown to skinny Badman. He put one ball to a Calera early where like it really was kind of guarded. He just threw it in a Right spot to where Cal Cate could go make a play on it.


But. yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. You're spot on, man. AND. I. Just think That. s Eagles don't need s Eagles fan base. You guys don't need to get too worried, man. Everybody knows That it. It probably should have went in in their way. But hats off to s Falcons. Yeah. I mean s big thing. Everybody's talking about ERs s end, right? Yeah. Of course. AND. That's what Falcons fans sure wanted me up there in s booth. Probably when things weren't going ERs Well. But yeah, four minute drill. It, it feels like teams, And, I. Don't know where you guys stand on this, but like it used to be just conventional, like run out ERs much time ERs possible. You don't really try And throw it in certain situations. Especially once s other team's out of timeouts. AND. s Big question.


That. Everybody's talking about ERs. That. Third down, And three. You know, they elect to go with a roll pass where s running back ERs and the flat right now. And. I get like I said, I, understand you run it, you're gonna guarantee you're gonna take off s 40 seconds. s keeps moving. Yeah. Yes. I, get it. AND. That's big in That situation. And. I. Think That. That's, it's hard to argue against, but I also think That roll Pass ERs kind of a conservative. 'cause if it's not there, Jalen ERs going down. And, you're gonna get s tie. Or he ERs gonna run And. You're gonna get s. That's only gonna be thrown if it's wide open. Which it was like it was s perfect play.


Call And. Yeah. s percentage chance That. A wide open pass to Saquon. Barkley's getting dropped. Like That. I. Just think that's gotta be pretty low. Very low. Like If you told me before s play, we can e, we can either run it And, we don't know how many yards we're gonna get. Or we can have Saquon wide open in s flat to catch a ball. And win s game. I'm probably taking That throw if he's wide open in s flat. Yeah, Because you don't s ball That at s same time. You guys got one of s best offensive lines in s league. Yeah. And. Tony. AND. I will say Tony Dungy brought up a great point with this. With us. It's not even third And three. It's third And two. 'cause you know, if it get, if you get two yards, you know you're sneaking it on That fourth down.


You're not even giving them a chance. I don't know man. It sucks I think. But we've been seeing more And, more of these decisions to throw it in these four minute situations. 'cause more And, more of offenses are getting aggressive. They don't wanna give s Ball back. We actually did it last week, s week, right before this against Green Bay. We elected to run, throw a slant route. Like, like And, I. Think even I. Forget who it was a announcing That game. But they were like, are they gonna pass this? Like it was obvious like Hey we're running this ball out. AND, they completed it. AND it ended up being a huge PL completion. 'cause We picked up s first down. We ended up fumbling it on s one yard line in tush. Push territory. And. But I think, you know, there ERs, there's a, it feels like more teams are passing in these situations now than they ever have.


But I don't know. A lot of this comes down to like game theory, And, analytics, And, Don. Don't know half of this stuff. I know s Safe call ERs to run it. And. s S keep That clock moving. s guys, That do know this shit Are s guys calling s plays AND. It was a wide open. It was wide open. And. You know, I hate to say this for s one. 'cause I love s guy And everything. Yeah, but it ERs. It just ERs what it ERs. He's, he's gotta come up with it. AND. I think he knows. That, AND, And. Here's s worst part about it. At s end of s day, here's s worst part of s That. At s end of s day, you win. And. And, you put s, you put s game in your defense's hands. And s defense has to make a stop. It ERs what it ERs. You can't throw it all on Saquon. You can't throw it all on. s Play call And. Things like That, like you guys had another chance. AND Kirk Cousins just, you know, he showed everybody why s Atlanta paid him $180 million.


Listen, Hats off to Atlanta. They played a fantastic game. I'm not trying to like, like they earned That win. No, like two ways about it. To March down s field there at s end with Kirk to take all s. Criticism. That, Kirk And, That team faced going and That game coming off of s Steelers. Loss. That was a big statement. Game offensive line. Huge Bounceback game for those guys. They played fantastic upfront for s Falcons. I'm with you man. Don, Don't think I've seen I mean I. I might have mentioned this already. I, don't think I've seen cut blocking like That at this day. Like you don't see people on s backside cut anymore. Chris Lindstrom was a cutting machine. And That Ball kept wind s back when it wasn't hitting front side.


I mean it was an impressive performance by s Falcons offensive line. It was an impressive bounce back game for Kirk. s coaching staff adjusted wonderfully. They got him under center, got him and things. That. He's Don Well his whole career. Listen, I'm obviously an Eagles homer, but I'll, I'll give s Falcons credit all day. They played their ass off And to come and Philly after a game like That. That's a tough matchup. They answered s Bell for sure. Well with one 40 left. Kirk cousin drives 70 yards. Gets s Go ahead, touchdown to a great route. Ran by by London And with 34 seconds left. s Eagles did have a final drive. And, I'm not gonna lie, man, with a couple timeouts in your back pocket.


It's Enough time to get a field goal. 100%. I I. I was kind of waiting to see if they were gonna pull this off. Yeah. Not kind of. I was I I fully expected. Jalen I had I, Had a little I, had a little juice. That That. Jalen was gonna find a way. Man. And, I'm, I'm sure he wishes he had That one back looking back on it on film. But at s same time, you know, throwing it up. s skinny Batman's always a pretty good chance. Did He get hit ERs? He was I mean s I know he was getting hit pretty much while he was throwing. Did That affect s Ball? Don? Don't know. I Have no idea. Either way. Either way. It Looked like a real time. But s Final Drive ends in an interception. Debates AND. Yeah. Any final thoughts, brother? No. Like I said I. I kind of closed it out.


I thought Atlanta played a really, really good game up front. I thought s Birds played Well on offense. Thought s Birds Played Well. Yeah. Yeah. I mean both teams did a good job in s Red zone of keeping guys out for s most part. But then s Offenses got going there towards s end of s game. And Atlanta just executed a little bit better. We talk about this like, you know, these mistakes like this ERs s Margin of victory in s NFL. And. You guys, you know, you s s Chiefs operate so Well in these end of game situations at being disciplined. And not beating themselves when it's this close. s teams That do That better ultimately end up winning more games in this league. And, it's just frustrating 'cause it was Right there, but Outstanding Game by Atlanta.


It was right there for them too. And, they were s ones. That capitalized. So shout out to Kirk. Shout out to That. Whole offense. Shout out to Raheem Morris. They got it. Don And I know. It ended up like it did. But at s same time, I'm, I'm putting s Ball in Jalen Hertz. And in Saquon. Barkley's hands at s end of s game to win it even after That kind of game. Those guys have s ability to finish it off. AND. Get s wins. And I. Don't think That Trust ERs gonna waver either way. I think. I think. You guys got everything you need to to be a great team over there, man. Right. All right, birds have s Saints down in New Orleans next week. How do s Eagles bounce back after That game? Listen, Don. Don't know That. There's a hotter team in s NFL Right now than New Orleans. You see what they did? s Dallas last week.


And Panthers, Well, s Panthers. One was like, it's s Panthers, but I'm just being honest. Like I was, I was I. Think everybody after s Panthers win, they they blew 'em out. Which ERs impressive. Anytime you blow out an NFL team, that's impressive. It doesn't matter who it's, yeah. So it was an impressive win. But Derek Carr, when he's on, he's a like, he ERs a very good quarterback when he ERs on. Oh, I know. But this week in Dallas, Joe, good Dallas has been in Dallas. Don. Don't think they lost a home game outside of s playoff game last year. Like Da s Cowboys in Dallas have been very formidable. And. They went in there And just put a whooping on them. Don don't know there's a hotter team. Right now s New Orleans in in s in s country.


This ERs a huge test. And a huge game for s Eagles to try And bounce back from. They look I mean their offense right now. I'm a big fan. They're doing s same thing with this. Like, they gotta figure out how to stop outside zone. 'cause that's all freaking s Saints ran again. I mean not all, but Dallas got a heavy dosing of outside zone with Kamara boot shots down s Field. Like, you better be ready. It's coming. So they're gonna have to, they're gonna Stress. You're gonna, they're gonna stress S East, And West. If I know Vic, he's gonna be, there's gonna be some accountability being held. That's for dang sure. And. They got s guys, they just gotta execute. Come on now. Let's move on. We're gonna get to s biggest storylines from across s league outside of those two games in week two right now.


Right? Nine eh, Big on close games. 11 games are decided by one score, including five That featured s Game winning score, And s, final Minute of Regulation or an ot. One of those close games was record breaking in a Buns way. Unfortunate for s Giants. I suppose s Giants lost to s Commanders 2118 And became s first team in s NFL History to score three. Plus Touchdowns allowed no touchdowns. AND lose in regulation. Damn. S Commanders only had field goals. And got 21 points. Oh, they probably had a defensive touchdown. I think there were a few, a few different other ways they scored. Yeah, Had to be Right. They didn't kick seven field goals. Right, anybody Waiting on Brandon?


You were s slowest Googler Man. It's not a quick hand, it's not a quick hand. I could have already found this out on my ES ESPN app. Have you ever seen seven field goals in a game? I've seen like maybe five Tops. That's a, that's a lot of field goals, bro. That's a fuck ton of field goals. I feel like we've had something close, but I don't know about seven fricking, They gotta find a way to get and the end zone if they're kicking seven. Yeah, shit. I feel you on That or not? Apparently you win s game still. There you go. There are also a few blowouts this week. Derek Carr, And s Saints. We already talked about it. Blew out. s Cowboys. 44 And. 19 Saints. I. Mean AND. s Cowboys look great against That Cleveland in week one.


So you know it's are s Saints are s Mighty, mighty Saints. You know, s I mean? Yeah. s Saints baby Alvin K. Do you know what Alvin I thought? They told me Right before I went on air. It's not Kamara, it's Cama ERs. That, right? Alvin Kamara I thought it was Kamar for my whole freaking life. Alvin Cama scored four touchdowns in s Win. AK Won s Hemi Award gotta there on s on s Monday Night Football broadcast. s same one of, He ERs one of s smoothest athletes I've ever fucking seen. S I love watching him run I really do ERs annoying ERs. It has been playing big games against That guy. He ERs So cool man. AND I. Think s shoes, like s cleats. He wears like ex like, like exacerbates it. You know what I mean? Something about wearing like a light colored shoe or a colored shoe when you're running it just like looks, Looks like different n B a jam when you had turbo on.


That's exactly what it reminds me of. Oh my gosh. You just hit s Nail on s Head. He's on fire. He's got s. He's got s s Turbo Unlimited Turbo. Yeah. Unlimited Turbo G Code. Yeah. Saint scored 47 points in week one. And I had 44 points in week two. They now have 91 points this season, s most by a team in its first two games in 15 ERs. So they're doing something Right down there. I really dig what? I I can't ERs it. Clint Kubiak s oc for it's Gary Kubiak son. Yeah, Dude. He's doing something. Right down there. And. Derek Carr has been, he Showed he playing Lights Out. He has Showed this his whole career. This upside's just been like inconsistent a little bit when he was in Oakland or I.


Guess El Vegas now. But man, his first two games have been pretty dang good. Across s board for those guys. Oh yeah. They're looking, they're looking good. Cardinal God, love That Took down. Yeah, right, right. love That. No, We. Play 'em in like three weeks. Do You? ERs That. Monday Night. Football ERs. That s Monday Night Game. That's s Monday Night Game. Monday Night Football. Yes, it ERs Jason. Right. I'll see you there. Cardinals took down s Rams. 41 10 I. Gotta say Kyler Murray I. I have not been this, especially with s injuries. That s Rams have right now. I mean s Rams are not, they, they got a lot going on in their own organization right now in terms of like players injured And. They've lost like maybe three or four offensive linemen.


P's out, like they're, they're struggles, right? Right now they're limping around a little bit, but That doesn't change. s fact. That, Kyler, Murray I. It was, it's been a up AND down for his career to start. Dude, I don't know That. I've like, he was throwing some balls, AND making some plays. That were just out of this world. He was incredibly, no, He's always been an electric player to watch dude. But I Mean he ERs always AND. He And, he's a gamer. Accuracy. Like he was putting some of his balls. I'm like, Are, you kidding Me? Fucking rifle. Yeah, it was very impressive game. You might be little guy, but don't, don't think he can't fucking sling That ball around, man. Yeah, there there's always been Questions about his Committedness towards Football. To be honest with I, think Committedness, Nice I I mean we're being honest.


I mean they used to like Track his dude. Dude, you've, you've Been killing s vocabulary today. Were, there were reports coming out. That, he wasn't watching tape because they were tracking his iPad usage or some crap. All I know ERs. That. I heard, I've heard through s Grapevine, That. He's like recommit himself in a different way this year. And, if that's s case, And, he can continue to do what he did yesterday. I mean, or this week. s Cardinals are are very, very good. Damn straight. They are, yeah. Cardinal's wide receiver. Marvin Harrison Jr. Became s first rookie with at least four catches, two touchdowns in s first quarter of a game since his dad, Marvin Harrison in 19.


That's pretty cool. 1996, which don't even know if actually cool. His name ERs Marvin Harrison, Sr. I. Think I, just know him. ERs Marvin Harrison I. Think he's just Marvin Harrison. There you go. Which ERs it's a stat. That means absolutely nothing other than he broke a stat That his dad had Which ERs How Does That work if maybe if you're Marvin Harrison, do you automatically become Marvin Harrison Senior when you have a son? That becomes Marvin Harrison Jr. No, our grandfather's name was Don Blaylock. Our uncle's name was Don. Blaylock. Yeah. That's a good point. I. Don't think Don Don. Don't think Uncle Don's a junior. No, he ERs not Alright. Right, Well. This isn't really helping us analyze week two. So let's move on. That's a big bounce back game for Marvin Harrison Jr.


Though. He, after struggles week one. Big game this week. We also got a couple upsets. Bak Mayfield AND. s Bucks take down s Lions. A lot of people didn't see That one coming, but B'S playing. Lights out baby. He's rolling AND. He ERs got s Bucks rolling. They're two AND. Oh, start this season. s Lions didn't, didn't look terrible, but didn't look great. You know, I think I. Think s Bucks just got after him a little bit. SVP brought it up on s Countdown show. But Todd Bowles, man, he's a great equalizer. He's just such a great coordinator. God dammit. That guy's, good man. He Can scheme up a run game. And like ERs great ERs. s Lions are And ERs good ERs. Their offensive line ERs. And, I'm sure. That, there's plenty of points.


That, they probably had opportunities in this game. Detroit. Like if you, you're shutting down their run game, it, it can make it difficult. And I mean Todd ERs just an incredible coordinator. He really ERs And. This ERs an outstanding win for these guys on s Road in, in Detroit, right? Yeah. I mean, come on, Shout out to Bowls. God love playing them in a few weeks too. Sam Darn. Led s Vikings to a 23 to 17 win over s 49 ERs. How about That. Probably s one s one game this weekend. That I definitely didn't see coming. I thought Sam Darn has always been a really good quarterback. You know, I think he kind of had some blows over there in Carolina his rookie year or his first couple years in the league.


But I always thought he was, he was a gamer. And. He had s Arm talent. And. He was smart enough. AND, he had like s swagger. AND. s s ability to, to be a great quarterback. And, sure enough, he's, he's showing it this year with s Vikings, man. Yeah, absolutely. Big time win. There's not A lot of good quarterbacks. That play Well in s Panthers organization. Right now. So I don't know That. We can hold That against him, but Well, And, Dalton's next. Oh, there we go. s Ginger S play s game though. ERs, you watch this clip right here on Justin Jefferson's 97 yard touchdown. s ref ERs flying. Absolutely flying. Trying to stay out of s fucking way. Yeah. Not S not s 97 yard reception. Let's check out this guy.


Look at him. Oh God. This ERs when he, when he cut it back, s ref knew he was right. He was in trouble. Ooh. Nice hip Nice way to open up s hips going full speed. That's pretty good. Yeah, You could tell That's a former athlete right there. Yeah. He, he might not be Former. No, that's still an athlete. That's a current Athlete's Athlete. Yeah. Check Him out. Look at s arms At him. Look at him. Get it going. Get it. Going's a great form. Stay outta s way. Yeah, he had his core. You could tell he's got a good core. Yeah. s you know, you see somebody AND, it's just very like, stable. Yep. Right here. It looks like they're floating almost. It's just Arms, And legs. That core ERs staying rigid. He had, he had good rigidity. Shout out to s Ref. You don't always see them showcasing their athleticism. Like That.

Cardinals, that's not That. Surprising. Raiders Being s Ravens another big one. That was surprising. God damn. Max Crosby man. Fuck That guy's getting better.


But just when you think he ERs fucking one of s he's Topped out. Just when you think he's top out, you know he's looking. Dude, Aiden Hutchinson ERs wreaking havoc right now. Really happy I. Don't have to play against That guy anymore. Yeah, ditto. Alright. Right Petty game ball in more news around s League, Steelers qb. Justin Fields introduced s World to s Petty game Ball during s Postseason. I'm sorry, during s Postgame press conference Fields was quoted I. Think we all know Russ kind of got Don dirty last year. It was awesome getting That win for him. He, he got a petty game ball, so it was great getting a dub for Russ.


There you go. I didn't, I didn't know they, I've never heard of That term, but I love it. Yeah. I'm not gonna lie. I think big fan I. Think a game ball ERs a game ball. Whether it's petty or not. Sometimes you just get motivated to win a game for a guy playing his exte. There you Go. Coach Tomlin declined to share more when asked about petty game balls. I can't give you all s ingredients to s Hot Dog. You might not like it. So now I'm even more interested like what s hell are We talking I thought it was just a game ball.
