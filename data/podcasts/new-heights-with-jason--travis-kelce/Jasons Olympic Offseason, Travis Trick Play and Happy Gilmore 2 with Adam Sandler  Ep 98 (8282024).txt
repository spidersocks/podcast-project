You're great. What was it like shooting this with Kylie? The for the NF. NFL. SUNDAY TICKET. No I. Think obviously whenever you're doing something with somebody That, you know, it makes it That much more comfortable. And for Kylie. And. I. We just kind of get to be goofballs together. And. It's a lot of Fun. You start to show That age, you're start to get bags under your eyes. No, I was just supposed to be like looking like eye black. I've never wore these things. Did did it work? I don't. I was only doing it for the commercial shoot. Did you see the difference afterwards? It's supposed to be instant I. Think the under eye mass. Yeah. I. Don't know. I Do My Eyes. How do they look right now? Very. It's, it looks great. Jason Nice. You look fantastic.


It's very demure. No, it was awesome. It was a lot of fun. The wonderful folks at YouTube TV made it really easy. We are big proponents of YouTube TV in the Kelsey household. We enjoy it. We can use it anywhere. Which ERs makes it easier to run around with kids. And every once in a while. You know, we're not a big screen time all the time. Family, but Hey, sometimes you need a little screen time. It helps And. I just like it. 'cause I can watch Sports. And. I'm looking forward to the NFL season this year. Being able to participate for the First time. Really? With NF NFL. SUNDAY TICKET. Oh yeah. Well I mean you're gonna be, you're gonna need the knowledge to talk because it's you're, you're obviously on the Monday Night countdown this year.


This ERs true And. Then on top of That, it's like ERs. Are you gonna use it? ERs like practice to like maybe start calling games or something? I Don't know. If I could I guess I could try That out. Nice. Just in the confines of my own home. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna use it for. I'm probably gonna use the multi-view. I'm probably gonna use it to really be able to follow everything that's happening. I mean, I've used Sunday ticket occasionally when we don't play on Sunday in the past to watch games. Yeah, but I mean usually Sunday's a travel day if you're playing on Monday. So the only day you get to really watch it ERs Thursday. I used it a lot last year when I was traveling because like you said, you can watch it from your phone.


Which I was able to watch more chiefs games last year on the road there. We go. Yeah. Than ever before. Which I loved I Was catching the Eagles games will never, we didn't play at the same time. And. Then And, I I. Kind of like, 'cause you, you get the stat view, you get the key plays. You can kind of like watch it at a, at a, at a quicker rate. Especially if it's a game in review. That already happened. Are you gonna get into Fantasy Football now? Are you a fantasy footballer? I've never been I I kind of might do it just to make me pay attention. You know what I mean? Because I feel like if, yeah, if you're doing fantasy Football, you gotta be in tuned in knowing who to bench, who to sit, how my team's doing, who's injured it.


It kind of forces you to follow what's happening in the NFL landscape. Oh yeah. So I think it might, doing fantasy Football might make me better on Monday night. So I'm thinking about maybe doing it I. Don't know. I've never Don fantasy. Football. I. Think the leagues have already started. So you might be a little behind the eight ball here. How Have they started? The season hasn't started. I'm pretty sure you draft your team before the game start. There's gotta be a way I can start this. Like I mean. I'm not a fancy Football guy, but I'm pretty sure this has already started. Started Crafts have already happened. Okay, Alright. Right. Right. right? Okay. Brandon's telling me right now you Yeah. Would I draft Travis? Yes. I would draft Travis. But I, apparently these drafts have already happened.


Yeah. All the professionals are saying, don't draft me without drafting. Pat Mahomes. You draft both. Yeah, you gotta, yeah, it's a dual thing. Why ERs That? We're just, we're a team. You get double the points, but You guys both probably go in the First round. I would imagine Pat's one of the high higher picked ones. Yeah. I. Don't think quarterbacks, A lot of quarterbacks go in the First round. They don't go in the First round. Or they do. No I Don't think so. Because I think the quarterbacks like you go a little later rounds because you, yeah. I heard ERs. Well. Find That. You can find more quarterbacks. And. You can find like skill players. That are gonna get you points week in, week out. Well I know touchdowns. I don't even podcasts. I. Just I. Just I mean I. Don't even podcast I. Don't even I. Don't even I really don't podcast play.


I'm not even sure what I'm doing here. Yeah. I. Think I know That touchdowns are all That matters. So I know, like running backs are hot commodities. And like receivers or tight ends. That score a lot of touchdowns or high commodities. Yeah. I'd imagine Jaylen's pretty good with all the touch pushes into the end zone. That ERs correct. But I don't know how That translates to quarterbacks throwing touchdowns. I suppose maybe that's why they go later. Yeah. Brandon said Arby's. Go First. Yeah. Jason won't be in any fantasy leagues this year. Maybe you'll catch 'em next year. Yeah. I guess. I guess I'll just like I. Don't know. Watch Football. I'm in on That. Well That does it for new news. Brought to you by our friends at NF NFL, SUNDAY TICKET on YouTube tv.


So make sure you guys sign up today. youtube.com/nh I. Think That stands for NewHeights. But there you, that's youtube.com/nh. All right, let's get to a little training camp. Trav, you've been off at Chief's training camp for what, a month now? Maybe a little bit longer. You guys report, when did you guys report The 19th I re I reported on the 19th of August. August. So not not A month. Let's That ERs a lie. I reported on the 19th July. Yeah. You reported before That July. Yeah, I was halfway through July. So we're a little bit over a month in officially three pre-season games in. Not right Now. How you feeling bud? How's the team Look? I'm not gonna lie. Man I am excited.


ERs a mother. Yep. I am I'm extremely. You Lost some of your facial hair. Yes. Yes. Well. I. Always do the, the Andy Reed special baby. You know What I'm saying? Got to Bubba. Sure, sure. It looks good. It looks clean. Love to the thanks bud. I grew out the hair though. I I switched it up at Well. I Don't got the buzz cut. And And. I'm, I'm not a super trooper. I'm more of like, kind of like a different character with this stash. But. yeah. Just having some fun with it. And When I, while I'm at training camp I really don't care how I look. I just want to be there. And. Try And. Make it the most enjoyable experience ever. I've officially spent an entire year of my life in St.


Joe, Missouri. 12 ERs of sitting in the same dorm room over there at Missouri Western State University. Yeah. That's, that's cool. It ERs It ERs you know, up, you know, I made it I made it I. Feel like I I kind of go to jail every time I do this. But it's, it's like a, it's like a sanctuary at this point for me. Yeah. It kind of like, it gets me in like the head space of like, I, get t work on my craft And. Not think about anything else that's going on. And like I can really like tune up. You know, my, my athletic abilities. Man And I. Yeah. I've learned to love it out there. I really have So I say this.


I And. It doesn't sound appealing, but I really do love it out there. I really do. And I, I, I I do find myself 'cause I feel myself. start at a very low point And, then working my way to being an NFL Football player. What do you love about St. Joe's Well this year? I Love the weather. It wasn't, it wasn't aggressive. We didn't have any like, really aggressive rain days or like lightning or like tornado warnings to where we had to go inside I Hate stay off That turf I hate running on. Yes. I hate running on turf. Especially throughout the preseason when you're really like adding the miles up And. Yeah. So being outside in front of the fans. That That, That happens. ERs Well. When you go inside, you're not around the fans. And And, everybody That wants to enjoy training.


Camp And coming off of two Super Bowl runs there. It's, it's pretty fun seeing Chief's Kingdom show up week in, week out. And seeing some familiar faces like Rasheed Wallace. Nice I did see Rasheed Wallace. Heck yeah. How's he doing? Doing good. Oh, he's killing it. He's killing he he's making, making his rounds for his podcast. Oh, Nice And then. Yeah. He's always been a Chiefs fan though. I. Think I think the world found out he was a Chiefs fan when he got signed to the, to the Detroit Pistons. And. They actually, I believe they went back to back, if I'm not mistaken. But he, he wore a chief's jersey And chief's hat while he's at his press day. Signing for the Pistons. Man. There we go. And.


If I just lied to everyone, I'm sorry. Nah, Well. Who cares? Wouldn't be the First time. Shout off the, the Show. That happens on this podcast. Pat Mahome said he Finally brought a tv. Did you bring a TV this year? No. YouTube TV Play. YouTube Tv. You can just watch it on your phone. That's kind of where I'm at. What are you bringing a tv? I'm not I. Don A TV I whenever I'm in the, whenever I'm Well. You brought Dorm. He brought it so you could play college. Football 25. Which I did jump on. That. Yeah. How ERs it I did jump on That. It's awesome. And I won a national championship with Cincinnati, which I always dreamed about doing. So You played so much That. You went through an entire season of college. Football. Yeah. What ERs it? It's just like you, you're on there like 15 minutes a game. And then. Yeah.


It's not, it didn't take That long. It's not Like That much. Yeah. It didn't take That long. It's fun though. Man. It brought back great memories. 'cause That ERs all I used to fricking play. I used to have a guy on every single universe or every single team in college. Football, And, And. Sure enough, I mean it's, it's like you're, you're a kid all over again. It puts me at a really simple state of, simple state of mind. Let's Get to the preseason a little bit. You guys obviously trying to Threepeat this year have made a lot of off-season acquisitions. Has anybody stood out to you throughout training camp practices, preseason games, Don? Don't know. What'd you learn about the Chiefs in this short stint before the season gets going?


We do have a very similar team to last year. So it's, it's been a fun training camp to kind of just build on That. It's the First time. That. We've really came into the season with the core group of guys. That. We had this the year before. And, don't get me wrong, We lost, We lost a few guys here. And there. Obviously MVS, And, sne, And, Willie Gay. Like there, there were, there were a bunch of guys. That or there were a few guys. That. That ended up getting paid everywhere else. And, I'm happy ERs hell for 'em. And. But we do have the Nucleus I think still together here in KC And. It's been fun because it's a lot of guys, That have practiced together for a really long time.


For sure. And. When you have That you have like a, a even better understanding of what they're doing on the other side of the ball. So now you have to get really creative. And, you have to be on top of your fundamentals. And, like be on on the same page ERs the person next to you or on sa on the same page ERs ERs the quarterback even more than you typically would because you're just, you're nonstop having to, having to go against a guy. That kind of knows or understands what you're trying to do. right. You know, so it's like it, when you talk about iron sharpens iron, it's like it's ERs to the max. So I really feel like all the new guys That are coming in had to kind of like raise their level of focus. And maturity, And And, a lot of the young guys did.


It's been fun. Well, you guys didn't play That much in the preseason games of starters, but you did play all Right And. You did play enough for Pat to pull off something he's never Don before. It included you And. It was a behind the back pass. Yeah. Man, Larry Bird, the big 33. It's a smooth operator right there. Magic Johnson style. Yeah. No I motioned over And. I'm actually, I'm looking at Pat while I'm wor I'm motioning over. Like, what did you say? Did you I? Because there's, here's the thing. When you're in preseason, you don't get a week to prepare for the game plan. Yeah. Going into a preseason game, it's just like you have the entire 300, 400 plays.


That you put in And install in training camp. right. And. Then you just, they take a few of 'em. And put 'em in the game plan. So you gotta really like go over your, your game plan And. You don't spend ERs much time game planning specifically for your opponents. S right, exactly. I wasn't in tune with the game plan And. Pat Mahomes had a, he had like something in the back of his head when I walked, when I walked across the line of scrimmages. Like, what'd you say? That. I didn't know what I was doing, so he was gonna have to make something shake. Sure. And. That's why we love playing with Pat Mahomes, Ladies and gentlemen. Because even when you fuck up, he makes you. right. This ERs just a boot play Naked Well or ERs it. Oh, this was a true read.


This ERs a true, he's got the option to hand this off. Yeah. The old RPO. It's a, it's A good I know. So you were supposed to go to the flat right away. And run this little rubber route Potentially. Yeah. I could have gone That way. I could have just did what I did. And then got the First down this way. But you know, there's, there's, there's options. There's options in Andy Reed's offense. And. It's because of a guy like Pat Mahomes That. You can, you can, you know, run these different options. That Right. right? You see just a little point to him right there. Like, ha ha glad we're on the same page. You Know, I saw the Show. I had idea. I had no idea. I felt Pat pull the Football And. So good And start to roll out. And I was literally just gonna start to run That way.


And like, oh, he like, he might need my help in blocking. He might need my help to like be available. So when I turned around, he was in mid, like behind the back pass, like a sports card. It was just like slow motion And. The ball was just floating to me. Sure enough, I knew it was third And short. So I just made sure That I, I got the I, got the sticks there. When you guys ran this full speed, I thought you were like the side view, like little block down And come back out. Like Lech, no. Now That, I'm watching this. It ERs a completely broken play. What This ERs I. I. Like I said I I screwed this one up. I did not look at Coach Reed after this play.


I knew he would've probably just come here son. Well I don't think he, he's That. I gotta talk you. Matter fact, I gotta talk. There's a clip of him having zero reaction. And just, eh, that's business ERs usual between these guys. Now Pat has pulled off the behind the back pass multiple times. Yeah. He, he's I'm telling you, he's Don it. He ERs Don it more times than once in practices. Yeah. And And people have only seen it in terms of like training camp practices or like him just screwing around in the, during practice on like his side of the field with the other quarterbacks to instinctually be able to do this ERs insane. It's, yeah, it's insane to have the, to cahones to be able to just like throw something behind your back in traffic.


Like That ERs insane And Pat. He made a great point. He's not gonna do it just to do it. He's only gonna do it when he needs to do it. right. There was, it was a, it was gonna be a weird angle if he would've threw it overhand for sure. Or if he would've threw it regular. Yeah. 'cause there was the defender was right in the space was in between, right. The the defensive end was Yeah. Yeah. The defensive end was making it difficult to, you know, have a growing Leg. You would had go over top of him. Exactly. And. Yeah. With people around me. That might not have been the best path. So for him to instinctually know That, he has the ability to do That. He has the skillset to do That And. Then to be able to do it in time. Man. It's, it's fun to play with. Yeah. That was, That was insanely cool to watch live.


What ERs? That. Typically the way it happens on like a pass That, it makes sense for, or ERs he usually doing it. Like where he ERs like, oh, I'm gonna goof around And. make sure I do this. You know what I Mean? No, that's what I'm saying. And, he, he, when he's been asked about this in, in like press conferences, And stuff. He's told everybody like, I'm not gonna do it just to like have the highlight of it. Like I'm only gonna do That when I need to do it. You know, And, And, sure enough, it was a perfect situation for him. You know, I sometimes it just takes somebody to fuck it up. Well, Good job. Because you brought That to life. Trav. Yeah. Well. And. Good job to Pat. Yeah. He has said That ERs a matter of fact he said it again. He said I didn't do it to look cool.


I literally did it. ERs I was like pissed. I was like, why didn't you run the route? That I wanted you to run a trap. It just work out. Got it. Got get in your playbook kid. Yeah. I think Andy had your back. He said Yeah. I saw the Pat threw him under the bus. But. yeah. I think it's That was the most exciting thing That happened. All preseason ERs. Well ERs being able to watch the new kickoff rule. What do you think of the new kickoff rule? I'm so excited for it. I. Think I. Think it's fun. It's coming bad. I was so against it. I was so against it. You remember we were talking about it. They were changing And. We were like, I don't like it. It ERs the ceremonial Football. You know, it ERs the First thing. It's what happens in Football. It's what? It's just, it's like two.


It's like war, like both sides. Old school war. Just like running outta charge. Yeah. But That wasn't an option. They weren't gonna let That happen anymore. Yeah. So And honestly, it's, it's still electric. It ERs guys are still like the guy with the ball ERs still hitting it. ERs hard ERs. He can Well. My question ERs, how long do you think it Lasts? I saw. I saw a guy. And. I. I'm Not gonna, there was to God, I'm not gonna name a guy, but I saw a guy almost get his head ripped off. And. I was And. It was a flag on us. And. I got so excited. That I forgot whose team I was on. And was just like, Woohoo. That's Football.


And And. Yeah. It's exciting. Alright. So that's all the Football we're gonna get into now. Chiefs And Eagle fans.

And rolling, but First, let's get a little out of the house. Kelsey's in Paris. Jason And Kai took over the Paris Olympics. That's s Right Jason. It was your First Olympics. How was Paris? Yeah. First Olympics. I was able to go to, obviously when you're in training camp, you miss Summer Olympics. Yeah. No matter when And, when you don't have, when you're playing Football season, you miss the Winter Olympics. Yep. So, you know, it's something That you, you wa We've always watched our entire lives growing up. Our Entire lives. Olympics are so electric.


They're, it's an incredible moment where people get to represent their countries across the world. Yeah. And, we really wanted to be able to take, take That in And. We like Paris. We, Kylie And I honeymoon in Paris. All Right. Now it was our second time being back And. It was fantastic. The city's really set up Well for it. It's very, the public transportation, the trains, all That stuff. We had an absolute blast. I Mean it was so cool. It was so cool. I went And saw Tay out in Paris. And. They were just start to like, kind of finish all of the little like stadiums, And, courts, And. It was so cool. That. They were just in the middle of the city. Like they were just making these arenas. And these like playing fields throughout the city.


And the parks. And obviously there was the, the sand volleyball. That was right in front of the Eiffel Tower. I mean it was so cool. Was there like a certain venue That was your favorite to, to be in the Rugby Sevens in the stadium of Paris or Stadium of France. I. Can't remember what the name of That major stadium ERs there That was awesome. Do you know That? Those games have like each half ERs only seven minutes. Yes. I I did. I noticed That just watching it. But I I did not know the rules of the game or really the timing or I didn't know any of That stuff. I've watched rugby fifteens before, but I did not know Rugby Sevens was That fast paced. So when you, like, you get a ticket into That Stadium, you get to watch every country play twice in a day.


Like you're watching a lot of games. That's crazy. Which ERs like, you know, you buy, not whatever else it ERs That one ticket you only watch in That. One event in most of That stuff. But the That was what was awesome by the Rugby Sevens. It was like you're seeing a bunch of action And. It helps when the, the USA women's team was pretty darn good. ERs Well. All right. Man. The field hockey games were actually being played at the old the last time the Olympics was hosted in Paris. So there's some Hi cool history there to That Stadium. The men's volleyball ERs. Dope And. Those guys are jumping up there. It's so impressive to watch volleyball. Man I Mean athletic ERs. Hell. The other one, That we saw was the women team gymnastics final, which you wanna talk about jumping.


We watched like every Girl Go And do the floor routine. Cool. And. Simone Biles ERs the last person And. I'm like, you know, she's getting older. You know, she's a little bit, we'll see how, how she looks I mean. There's no way you really thought this. I Did think That because gymnast don't, dude. Because gymnasts, when, if you go look at like the age of gymnast, they're usually not in their mid twenties to late twenties. They're usually young. Like they don't, they usually don't age. And sustain Well later. But I don't know why. I just I automatically assumed she was the anomaly. You would be Right. She ERs the anomaly because she jumped higher than everybody And. It wasn't even close. You could tell just on That, like First jump On like a Splunk. Like you watch all these people do the forward routine.


Then it's Simone ERs at the end. And the very like within the First three seconds. You're like, oh, that's different. She just jumped five feet higher than everybody else. That has Don this. Wow. So good. Man. Yeah. So That Was And. It's such a feel good story. Yeah. Knowing the, the past And everything. That. She's had to go through And just to feel confident. And getting back up there. Mentally it's the best. Man so happy for her. And. America's so proud of her. Man watching the, watching all those girls stand up there. And represent the USA And. Get a gold medal. That was probably the highlight for the Olympics. Being able to be there. And witness That. So cool. But it was all great. I mean the me I met a lot of the women's rugby team players.


L And. Nicole I mean the whole team. At one point, I met all the, there was nine I. Think nine. Hopefully I'm right on That. Nine girls on the field hockey team were from the PA area. Like, Oh wow. Yeah. It's a hotbed. I didn't know That. Exactly. Exactly. I mean makes sense. That Kai played So. we were hanging out with their families, watching the games, grabbing drinks afterwards. It was really, really cool. And, the only other world event I've been to was the World Cup. I went to the World Cup in Brazil. But what's so awesome about world events ERs, you just have people from all over coming to this one area, And, they're all there to just appreciate the sports. Yeah. And, it's, yeah, it's just awesome. It's fun. I love it in Paris. ERs a great city. So it helped out. I, I, concur.


Well Coach Kai spotted in Paris working with a new field hockey prospect. She was coaching you up a little bit, showing you how to, how to swing the hockey stick. Oh yeah. ERs It ERs it much different from the ice. Did you need some, some different pointers or what? Listen, field hockey's kind of stupid. Shut up. You can't, yeah, it's not, I'm not believing any of this. I, there are certain things. That just don't make sense. Like in field hockey, you can only use the one side of the stick. You can't use the back side of the stick. It's a, it's like illegal. It's like, why ERs this illegal to use the other side of the stick? Because that's the game. What do you mean And? They're like, oh, because it's rounded so you shouldn't use it. It's like, just 'cause you shouldn't doesn't mean it should be like against the rules to just use the backside Of the stick.


It's illegal. Don't touch the ball with your hand. In soccer. You Can't kick it. If the ball's at your feet, you what do mean? You can't kick it. If it hits a foot, it's a penalty. It's a Foul. Dude. Just being honest, I telling. You can't kick a, you can't kick a goal in, in hockey either. I'm not saying to kick it in, but you can kick it back up to your stick. Like all I'm saying. Just because you're not skilled enough with the stick does not mean it's stupid Jason. I'm just saying it would, it would decrease the stoppages. It would, it would make the game more exciting because you'd be able to utilize more. Append Guy, a business guy, Man. He just wants to make the game more exciting. It's like the opposite of soccer. You can't use your feet. You can only use, you can't use your hands. You Well, I. Guess you can kind of block stuff with your hands.


You can, but you can only use the one side of your stick. And. I. Just think it's inhibiting creativity. And excitingness of field hockey. I. Think it's you're, it's making you more what ERs it. It's making you more disciplined on your creativity. And being creative within the rules of the game. Jason. All right. So Jason sucks the field hockey. Kylie shaking your head up here right Now. And. Then you saw the US win the First Ever Medal in Rugby Sevens. We just talked about That. That's pretty cool. Did you get to see some of those things up close those medals? No. I. I saw some old ones. 'cause there was, there were people in the stands. That had 'em.


That I met former Olympians. Oh Shit. Nice Ally. Rman I. Don't think I saw her medal. I saw at the rugby game. There were two former gold medalists. That were rocking there. One was from Rio. Dude, I gotta say this story. I'm sit, we're sitting there watching the women's gymnastics final, Subtle flex. We hadn't seen the kids in a while. And, Kylie's, I. Think feeling a little bit of like, like baby, like I need to, I'm missing my kids, right? And. We're sitting there And. Kylie turns around And, she turns back And. He says, oh my gosh, there's a baby up there. And. It ERs so adorable. And, I, turn And.


It's fucking Michael Phelps holding his child Phelps. Like Kylie Phelps. If you see Michael Phelps, you don't say someone ERs holding the baby. Like, what are we talking about Right Now it's the most decorated Olympian in the history of the Olympics. Holdings a baby. It's created the number one athlete of architect. You We with Michael Phelps. The guy ERs funny ERs Fuck for That. You turn around, you don't even see the baby. You see I. Are. you kidding me? I didn't even realize he had a Baby. That. The baby ERs not a highlight of what's happening over there. Oh yes, it ERs. Oh yes, it's, That's s Right. The baby's always the Highlight. phe offspring ERs. Exciting for America. And. That's fair.


Okay. That's Exciting for, that's a Fair point. America. Shout out to Michael Felch. Man such a good dude. I played some golf with him over there. And at the win out in Vegas during Justin Timberlakes golf outing. Oh, Nice 8:00 AM 8:00 AM golf. Awesome. But let's not get away from what happened out in Paris. Jason Okay. What? What Happened? You arm wrestled. I Was asked to arm wrestle. I just wanna put That out there. I was not You arm. Yeah. Took I. Did Not in the arm Wrestling. Yes. But at the same time you agreed to do this. Yeah, I did. Hopefully I'm saying this Right. But you arm wrestled Nicole Everland. Yes. I did. Yeah. Which had some saying maybe you were cheating. And. We all know Jason Kelsey's mentality.


Why ERs That. What? What am I cheating? How am I cheating? What Do you mean? Everyone knows you're offhand has to be free. That's Not true. Watch any arm wrestling like sanctioned event. Their arm, their offhand ERs grabbing sanctioned event. Yeah. Any legitimate sanctioned event? No. It's just Any legitimate arm wrestling event. Your offhand ERs grabbing something. They're not free. You're just making this Up, dude. No, I'm talking about a Legitimate arm wrestling event. And And. Show me what they're offhand doing. No, it's like, it's like, it's just the respect of like a bar arm wrestle, That. You just don't grab anything else on the table. It's just strictly in That power. I have never once That. Because now you're torquing, you're using core And, you're using more muscles.


Everyone knows I. Just grounding myself. I'm just getting a better base. Not twerking anything. Leave It to Jason to move the ball forward a little bit on those, those tush pushes. Leave it to Jason to Listen. I'm going to, if you let me round my, my wrist. If you let me round my wrist over, I'm gonna do it. I I hate arm wrestling. I really do I. It's a lose lose. Especially when you're challenged by somebody who's smaller than you. Because it's like, if you win, it's like, oh cool. The big guy just won arm wrestling event. If you lose, it's like Hey. You just got your ass kicked by someone much smaller who should not be beating you in arm. Wrestling. Lose lose. But I get challenged by an Olympian. What do I do? I can't say no. Yeah. You say I'm gonna play to climb. Yeah, because I have, I have elbow I have I, have bones like I.


I went for That. Sprinkled I. Legitimately went for That. I said, actually, my elbow's kind of screwed up. And. I could tell That Nicole was not going for it. And I was like, Okay, You gotta sell it. You Gotta sell it. We're gonna do this. Aren't We all Right? Let's do it. You gotta sell it. And. Now I have legitimate arm wrestlers challenging me. Of Course you do. Just like I. Forget what his name ERs. You've seen him all over Instagram. He does like freaking weights with his wrist And. I'm like, dude, I'm not arm wrestling you motherfucker. There's no way you want, there's no chance we're doing this. You would you think there's something wrong with your elbow until you go My Elbow That. My elbow ERs. Elbow ERs. No. There ERs something wrong with my elbow. I tore my growth plate when I was younger. And, it has never healed. Yes, my elbow would snap if I went up. Devon Lt, Shout out to Devon.


T Jason ERs out. He's terrified of you. Yeah. I'm not doing it. Well. Let's just drop a poll. And. See Jason. Whether you guys the 92 Percenters will, we will leave it to you guys. Did Jason cheat or not? It's ERs simple ERs. That though. Don don't need cheat. Don don't need a poll on this. It's not cheating. I. Go I. Do I. Do I need one? I. Don. So we're gonna do it. Don don't listen. You can't. The the, the general public has no purview in this, in this, this category. They have no, they have no right of of of what the rules are. You can't retroactively, if We take a general poll, everybody will lets you use the backside of the stick. And field hockey. But they don't let you use the backside of the stick. Those are the rules. The rules of arm wrestling are your off hand gets to grab something.


Never heard of That rule. Just watch any, there's a freaking entire handle. That. They're grabbing in all these events. Dude. Alright. right? So we'll get off the topic. We'll let the polls decide. There's, I'm not letting Polls decide. Kylie. No. All right. Poll decides nothing. Alright. Right. You win. Kylie posted on Instagram a video of the aftermath. She said, when you Finally sit down after all the excitement, a win for men's volleyball, a bronze for women's rugby, And, then a gold for women's USA. That's s right Gym. Jason I can't help. But notice you have like Impeccable tits. Yeah. 100%. Your tits are impeccable.


I'm so jealous. I. Wish my tits sat up like That. No. You have what looks to be like a handball from ERs. That. A ERs That. A legit handball. No, It's either a volleyball. I can, lemme see his picture. ERs That. A mini volleyball. Yeah. So they gave us like a little mini volleyball when We were at the men's volleyball Game. Oh, Man. I thought you got one of the handballs. I was like, dude, let's do I. Got a rugby ball. I got a rugby ball. And a mini handball or a mini volleyball from men's volleyball. I mean it was still pretty cool. It was dope. Well. I'll take it back. I. I. Legit. I legit wanted like looking back on it. Like we asked the question, what event do you think we'd be good at? I. Think I.


Think handball. My Elbows fucked up. Yeah, but I think I could be a goalie. Man. 'cause sometimes they just do the flying. You got the reach flying squirrel. Yeah, they just do the flying. Some of the goalies just do flying squirrel And like throw their arms, And legs. They're Just trying to get ERs. Big ERs possible. Get big. Yeah. They're Doing The goalies in handball are doing what they tell you to see. If you do, if you see a bear, just get ERs. Big ERs possible. It's like Man. These goalies would scare the fuck outta some bears. But they aren't stopping a handball to Save their life. Those, it's like a squirrel. Like every time I like the I, like the cutoff. Some of the angles get out there. But at the same time, at some points, I was just like, dude, you guys aren't even going for the ball. You guys are just trying to get big. Yeah. And. It's like I. Think I Could I think I could bring some something to the table.


Yeah. Playing goalie for the USA handball team. I do not saying I do. Not saying That. The goalie for USA was bad. I'm saying all the goalies in general. I'm like the techniques That, they're being taught I. Feel like could, could use a little revamp, but also never played the game. Never had somebody throw a handball Like That. Yeah. We've Never Don it before in our life. It's very, yeah, it's a little arrogant to think That. You could go in there right away. And be better than the best in the world. Probably. But it's A little backyard Football. Backyard dodge ball. It's like there's a few other sports. Gotta we? We've Don stuff like it. Maybe not exactly Remember. Yeah. But I was super pumped. I thought That was a handball. When I saw it, I was like, yes. He's breaking back the, it's like, what's the game? And. Quiddage. It's like the fucking, what's the little Well You're looking for the snitch. There's also the snitch ERs.


Like the snitch. There's Bulgars or something like That. And. They I. Forget what the ones are. That you're trying to throw into the rings. All right. Fucking don't. We didn't have to go into it. They got it after the snitch. I Think Brandon helped me out. Quale. Quale ERs. What you're trying to get through the rings. s right. No I. Anyways. I was going for the snitch. You were Right. I. Wanna start like an initiative? And Now That, I'm retired. I kind of have time. I wanna take guys? That weren't quite good enough to go. 'cause let's say, let's face it, the best athletes in America, for the most part, when they're young, a lot of our athletes choose to play Football, And, basketball, And. How many of these athletes do we lose on these other sports? Because we're so focused on the NFL And.


NBA I. Hear you I mean the main sports. You could throw baseball in there too. You can throw baseball in there too. Yeah. Yeah. I. Okay. But baseball's like a specialized sport. It's not like, just because somebody's good at baseball doesn't mean they're gonna be great at another sport. Maybe there Are a fuck ton of kids out here playing baseball. Only That are really good athletes. And, it's so much harder to get through baseball. Okay. Fine. We'll throw baseball in there. Either way. My premise ERs ERs there. I feel like we should be like ERs. A nation taking some of these athletes That like either retire early or weren't quite good enough to make it to the N-F-L-N-B. A major league baseball. And. Like pushing them into like other Olympic sports.


Yeah. I. Hear you I. Hear you. I mean we're We. Were kids. Where we wanted to play everything And. This ERs probably why we think we'd be good at anything you throw us into in the Olympics. But I, I. I'm a firm believer. That, you need to have kids try everything out. Like for wild. Especially if you, you're I, but I'm not talking about kids. I'm talking like a 22-year-old Man. He's bounced around on practice squad for a ERs, Well. That's where it's start for all these other countries. It's start at the adolescent level. ERs, That. These kids are like being, They have a leg up. They have a leg up. So it's like I Hear you on That. But it also starts with like being a kid. And. If you've fall in love with this sport. Yeah. Like run with it dude. Like have fun. Like go crazy enjoying this thing.


And really become like the, you know, an Olympic athlete in That regard. Yeah. I just want to take all the guys. That aren't quite good enough in the NFL And. Have 'em play rugby And. See what our US men's rugby team looks like. I. Hear you Not trying to And. I'm not trying to talk trash on USA men's rugby. That ERs doing it. Like I'm not saying That bobsled. Get some big old d lineman. That got freaking fast. Starts pushing That sled. What you think D lineman. I. Don't I mean I. Think tight ends are probably better. Here's the thing with bobsled though. The bobsled I like the linebacker tight end Bree, because you That a little bit of weight to get That thing rolling faster. Well this ERs. This ERs why I think it might behoove you to be a little bit heavier if you can still maintain That acceleration.


'cause the bobsled ERs all about to start Unless you can accumulate speed in other ways. But here are my strategy. Did you know That like the full Weight I? Don't even know if that's true. I just assumed physics was involved. Like That Well. I'm to drop some physics on. Did you know the full weight of the sled has to be like with the riders in it has to be of similar weight to like across the board. So in other Words, so there's weight classes. No. Let's say the sled has to weigh a thousand pounds, right? Arbitrarily the sled Plus, all the riders has to weigh a thousand. So if your riders weigh 500 pounds, the sled weighs 500. If your riders weigh 800 pounds, the sled only weighs 200.


God dammit. You. Yeah, you do a little bit of math row. Sorry. Yeah, sorry. So I got excited I. Guess my my point ERs. If you have a bunch of D Lyman pushing a bobsled, the sleds gonna weigh less And. They're stronger. So they're gonna be pushing something that's way lighter to 'em. So are they gonna be pushing it faster? Maybe. Especially if they're like Miles Garrett, type D lineman. That got freaking fast. Get offs. Dude. You think Miles Garrett's the next I mean he could be on it Bobsled. He could be on it. He's got the narrow hips too. He's gonna fit in the bobsled. That's my one question about like, you kidding Not get in those shoulders. Get Some of That deep tackles their asses might not fit in. That. Motherfuckers getting those shoulder That dude's shoulders are enormous. You can't even get through a doorway. He's so fucking kidding me. He's got some White shoulders.


I think it's worth testing out. That's all I'm saying. I think it's worth testing out. 'cause in a bobsled, the majority of it ERs how fast you get That thing moving. Yeah, And then it's all in the driver. It's all on more re after That Right. Now You're John Candy And. Fucking cool runnings s right now you're John Candy. You're just like, give me some of these track athletes. That can That are explosive. And getting can get moving pretty fast. And see what they can do. Handball I mean, dude. Can you imagine? You get like some dude That like six 10 wasn't quite good enough to get in the NBA playing Handball. I mean you gotta be able to throw the ball. I'm talking About goalie That long, those long gangly arms. He's doing like pretzels, And shit. Maybe. What's another sport? Well high jump. Just get some big six 10 basketball player.


Have him lose a shit ton of weight. So his ankles look like they're toothpicks. And. He's just hopping up over That thing. There's no way. Do you know No I don't know why. No. Like What would, what would Vince Carter have Don in the high jump if he would've dedicated his life to the high jump? He was a two foot jumper. He could do what he could. He was a two foot jumper. Could. He could jump anyway. He Definitely wasn't a fosbury flop Flopper. Could you imagine if he changed the high jump forever by being just a two jump, right? It's like watching those old school videos of the fucking Olympics where they're not even jumping on a mat. They're just like they're diving over it.


Alright, Right, Well That doesn it for getting out of the house. Like Kelsey's in Paris. We loved watching you guys. I'm not gonna lie. Being in training camp watching the Olympics, it's always like a, like a something That takes you away from the, the prison That you feel like you're in when you're in training camp. And. I absolutely loved when I got to just turn on the TV And. They made a quick shot over to two of the most proud Americans. That I know. Or two of the most, two of the people. That America loves the most. And, it was awesome to see you And Kai out there. And. Join it all. And soaking in a few gold medals or just medals across the board for USA. Let's get to some no dumb questions because there's no dumb questions, Ladies and gentlemen.


Just dumb people like myself. This might surprise you, but no dumb questions just brought you by. That's s right. Our friends at NF NFL. SUNDAY TICKET on YouTube tv. How about, How about it. Good job. YouTube tv. It's a beautiful thing. Alright Right Well from Cam webbing 17 on. It looks like Twitter. Welcome back y'all. What's your favorite thing? That. You guys have Don during this break. Hmm? Jason. You want I mean you went to the Olympics. That's gotta be pretty cool. Right. Yeah. Olympics ERs I mean. Dude, we went to the top of the Eiffel Tower, which we didn't do last time, which dude, I was. It's fucking scary. Going up in That elevator. You're looking out And. It's not a lot.


I mean. It's just like a frame. So you're seeing everything. And it. It was built so long ago. I It And. It's creaking ERs. You're going up like, it's like Don't love That. It was Don't I. Don Wanna do That. I was trying to play it cool. And I did not play it cool. And Callie was making fun of me. Which I deserved. But it was scary. Yeah, Not gonna lie. Well heavy Man in an elevator. That creaks. Fuck That. Great View worth it. But What did I do? That I can talk about That. I did during the break. I don't even remember when We stopped. So. we stopped. The First thing we did was went to Tahoe. That was the First thing.


We did. Oh Yeah. Nice Tahoe was a blast. Crazy I always have so much fun in Tahoe. They gift wrapped a a karaoke victory for me. You got right off the plane. And went straight to karaoke. And Bow. A little biased. Didn't fucked up the First verse, but it ended strong. So what happens when there's karaoke And? No words I. Guess. Oh, you know what it was? It was getting Jason on the roulette wheel, baby. Oh yeah. He's in Ladies and gentlemen. I got him addicted to the wheel. He can't get off. He ERs rolling. I'm not a big roulette guy still, but if I'm with Travis Kelsey, I'm playing roulette. 'cause Trav ERs He's a fun time at the roulette table.


Both Kai And, Jason. Were killing it on the roulette table. I'm Not a big, like, I'll, I'll go to the casino, but the casino ERs always about who you're with, who you're with, whether you're having fun. 100%. Which also, which leads me to the next point. Do not be the shitty one at the table, guys. Well, do not be a table ruiner Losing or just like a downer. D ERs a downer. Yeah. ERs a downer. You could be bad at the game, but you gotta bring good vibes. All right? It's All about the vibes in the casino. Everyone's control of their own success to an extent, to blackjack. A little different. But the roulette wheel, you're in control of your own success. So it's like the person next to you. Don't do this. Don't be the guy. That That. If it's a table, when you know, everyone's like, ah, yeah, all right.


right. Guess I'll give you a fist pump. You know, it's, it, it could, it can really ruin an experience for somebody who's, who's hitting on every single number. Like Jason was. I was, I was hitting our anniversary. Yep. Ooh. 14. 14, baby. Yeah, baby That was a hot number. I had, I had intern Brandon throwing me numbers from left Field. And nine was, it was a good one.

Yes. Yes. It comes out on Tuesday. I did, I was doing a tour running around for like a couple, a couple ERs, you know, in And out I, kind of do it like I, I, go away for a couple weeks, then I go back home for a month or two. Then I, go do another couple week That kind of thing. Yeah. And, when I was out on the tour, I was like, oh, Man probably should make a special, just so I, 'cause I know, one day I'm gonna throw this material out, And, move on to some new stuff. So, we might ERs Well document it. And. So, I said, let me do a special. Netflix said, That sounds good. And. Then I called Josh Ty, who's this great director?


And And. He did Uncut Gems. Him And. His brother Benny did Uncut gems. And I said to Josh, you would you wanna maybe direct a comedy special And? He said, yeah, yeah. And I thought we were just gonna shoot a normal special. But he just kind of took over. And made it a different style. And different feel. And threw weird stuff at me. And, we, it's just, it's a special, but it's kind of like a movie special. It's different. It's a little Different. Yeah. Yeah. I cannot wait for everybody to see this Man. They Let us preview it. And. That was alone the coolest thing ever. Oh yeah. It was awesome, brother I. Cool. So, Thank you, bud. What? You're right. It ERs different. And. It's like kind of segmented. There's a whole like thing going back And forth with the projection. And all That.


What, how do you, how do you even get to like creating something like That? Like I know That, like stand up. You're bringing on jokes. And, you're trying to figure out your routine. But That thing was so unique. How did That whole process come about? Well. I was kind of ready to just do a normal standup special. I was excited 'cause I was kinda locked in. You know, when you do standup And, you're on the road. It evolves. You get better And better at your act. And, figure out better things to talk about, figure out better ways to tell your, your thoughts or your jokes, or whatever the hell it ERs And. So I was kind of locked into a certain way. That That. I was ready to, ready to, you know, throw down And.


And. Then he, he, Josh was just kind of like, you know, we've seen, seen you do a standup special already. I did one like six, six ERs ago. So he said, let's try to come up with a new way to present it. So that's kind of what happened. What made you wanna get back into the standup realm? Like you took a long hiatus from it. Not too long, I saw a hundred percent Fresh Live. Actually, I was at the, the Hayworth out there in LA. Dude, that's S right buddy. I. I. Remember seeing it? I was So, I was so, fuck.

No, but I've seen you swing It ERs Nice. It's fun. I gotta say, when I'm doing the Happy Gilmore swing, I'm maybe one for four with That, one for four.

It seems like they have fun on the course. I, get a little snappy out there. Snappy. Little, little I get frustrated.


Have you gotten back into playing at all just to kind of get ready for the movie? Or did you ever, did you take a time off from playing golf or, Yeah, sort of similar to my comedy career. I kinda dipped out for a while. And. Then I was like, what am I doing? Man. Let me get back into golf. And I. I. I. Absolutely. I played when I was a kid. I played when I was like 12. And. My dad was awesome. My dad was a really good golfer. He should, he's shoot in a low seventies I. Still can't do it. I can't get it there. Holy cow. I can't get down low. I've had a good nine. I had a good nine, maybe two weeks ago at, at Riviera I. Oh, Nice. I. I. Think I. Think I. I could say.


That's Why they play the Genesis Open. That's a legit course. Yeah, exactly. That's a tough one. I mean, I played from the whites, but I shot still. I shot Okay. But I can't. I can't put 18 together. I can't do it. I can't concentrate. That long. Are you guys good with 18? Dude, I suck. I, I, I. I have a very, it's like Third to last in the Tahoe golf out here. Oh, yeah. It was not good. Didn't break 91 time. I. Hear you. That's kind of my, my spot too. Around 88 or something. Yeah, I'm good. I'm good. Probably playing 18 when it gets to like 18, three days in a row. I am just cooked. Man, I am cooked. And, I. My swing ERs all over the place. I'm not made for three days of golf in a rope. That's a lot of thinking. That's a lot of thinking. Hey. I can't stay still for That long.


Like Right right around hole six. I start going, what the hell am I doing here? What happened in my life? Did they Have, did they have burgers on the turn? What are we? How? Yeah. Yeah. Once I, eat, eat at The clubhouse. That's so funny. When I grew up, my dad, there was a, we used to play at this one place, And, I. Think it was whole 13. They used to put out Polish sausages, And hot dogs, And stuff like That, And. Every time I ate there, my father would go, oh, there it goes. Game over. He's gonna stink now. I'd be like, no, no, no. And. I would just eat too much. And just getting a little coma. And be staring. My father be going, why did you eat That? You Mor, Right? Yeah. I was about, say you inspired an entire like generation to get on the golf course.


Man, I. Promise you, you did. I was one of the kids. We used to go up to the public course all the time. And just wanted to absolutely hammer him. And. And hit him with That, the Happy Gilmore swing, And, everything. That's So great. And. We were hockey players growing up. So That. That, right? That the movie. It hit extra hard. Yeah. It Boy hit so hard. Man And I. Know you, both of you guys. Remind me of my friends so much growing up. Like, oh, I, if you met my friends, what you did, you actually saw a few at the U2 show, right? That Was awesome. Man, oh, how cool was That concert? That Was incredible. What a night it. But it was more fun seeing you there, buddy. We love seeing you. No, dude. That was like I. I was telling Trav. I've told him before. I told him, reminded him again today. I have not been starstruck like much of my life.


And, seeing all of you guys next to me, like the entire ensemble, especially you. It was like Man. What the f? Where the fuck am I at Right now? That was cool. Man. It's insane. Man, I. I was like, I came here to watch YouTube. And, I saw every person That, like I ever looked up to like And. Like all of the best shows, all the best movies. Like, it was so cool. It was awesome. Thank you Man. Well. We love seeing you too, bud. We talked about you flying home That night a Anyways, That was a fun, fun time. But you both, you boys, remind me of exact dudes. I hung out, out with growing up. And, you, you two guys, the guys, they would protect me.


I was a little bit of a wise guy. And, And, And, I. Had a couple boys like you always around, making sure I didn't get beat up too much. Yeah, Man. I was That Jason. Speaking of kind of like being in a room where you're like, how the fuck did I get here? Was there ever a moment like That early on for you, where you're just like, how did, how did it happened so fast? How did I get here? Yes. What ERs this? Yes. Yes. I'm sure I, like I don't remember anything. Saturday Night Live, That, That kind of did it to you. Every, every week you'd meet superstars. That, you grew up with Dan Roy, like all the, this, the original SNL cast, We got to meet so many of those cast members. And. Then just comedians, We all loved growing up.


Then rock, rock stars, We, you know, We got to meet the, you know, Paul McCartney, And, Bruce Springsteen, And. Everybody We talked about. All of a sudden, We were in the room shooting the shit with incredible. That's awesome. Man. Before, before we get off, happy Gilmore though. I was, I'm actually curious. I'm not familiar with how the original like thought process of the movie came, came about. Oh, Okay. Yeah. And, I, And. I'm a little, I'm pretty curious. Like, how, like, was it just you just messing around on a, on a golf course, And it, kind of connecting the dots, or what it It was, it was my dad. Like I said he liked golf. We used to go to the driving range a lot. And I had a, a great friend, Kyle McDonough, who played, ended up playing pro hockey.


He great hockey player in New Hampshire. It's a big hockey town. Oh Yeah. Hell yeah. Yeah. So, so Kyle came out with me, And, my dad, And. He didn't play much golf, but he was banging them. We were young, maybe ninth grade or something. I, something like That And. He was banging them. My father kept saying, Man, you hockey players, there's something about That your wrist or the way you turn or something. Like, That, And, And, And. I just was like, I. Think I was in college or, or finishing up college, or just maybe 23. And, I, I thought Man, Man. That'd be pretty funny to see a guy with a hockey mentality have such a big hit. That. He gets up, gets on the tour, And, I, I.


Remember calling my dad, And telling my dad about it. And going, what do you think, And? He was like, eh, it could be pretty good. We'll see. You know? We'll See. We'll see. But we, me And, my buddy Hur, he who I write all the movies with We would write That And. We'd call my dad. And say, does this make sense? And And Golf do when you put, what do you think? Like, And, it's all in the hips. And stuff like That. That was my dad. I would say, oh my gosh, what ERs it? He said, it's all in the hips. Baby That so good. It's all in the hips. And. That's why we wrote That shit. You know, Chubs loves Dairy. Man, What's in store with the sequel? What do you like, Don Don't, without giving away too much, obviously, but like, what are We, what are we looking for here? Well F First of all Travis. We're gonna have fun because the scene you're doing ERs with so many great golfers.


It's gonna be a amazing, you're gonna be funny ERs. Hell, oh Yeah. The movie itself, it's just picks up from a, a older guy who's, you know, played golf a long time. Some stuff goes on in his life. He's a little, he's different. Things are, he's, he's a, a bit of a mess. When you meet Happy And And. Then we kinda try to get his, his life cooking again. Wonderful. I. Love It. Man. That's I. Think it's cool. It's gonna be gonna be I. I mean. We're trying to make you laugh the whole time. But it's, it's gotta gotta to it. If You're doing, if you're doing it, it's gonna be fucking great. I seen, right? Yeah. You on, You are on Fallon letting everybody know That, you've been waiting for the Right storyline.


You've been waiting to like, feel the moment of it. And And to do it, right? Yes, yes, yes, yes. We We, We got We got all the trust in the world. You're gonna, you're gonna bring happy back. And. Make 'em lovable again. Man. Thank you, bro. Thank you. I. I love. Yeah, I. Don't wanna I don't want anyone to get let down. So you got That in the back of your head.

I've got to meet so many greats over there. And e You guys, you grew up I. Think there's some sort of connection to how fucking confident you are. And comedy when you're being funny. It's, it's usually, if you're confident in what you're saying, And committing to something. So if you ask a an athlete, it's probably gonna be a little bit better if you say it like this.
