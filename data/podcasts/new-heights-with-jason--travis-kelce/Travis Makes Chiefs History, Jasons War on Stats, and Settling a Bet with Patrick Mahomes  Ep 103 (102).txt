We need Sister Act in there. Sister Act two though. I Want Sister. Act two though. Sister Act Two ERs. That was more my jam. They brought in I Believe Kids And.

Go rewatch It. You love watching old 1960s movies though. You're fucking, you love That shit. course. Course I do listen I to get like some guilty pleasure watching it, but it's one of those old ones. That. It puts up the disclaimer at the front end. Like, oh, we're about to see some culturally inappropriate material for 2024. Yeah, it's not funny. We can't laugh at That. It's just full on animal like, dude, I'm out.


It's Animal mistreatment. It's, there's a full on Tiger And. A Dog fighting in one of the scenes. And. It's a little bit too real. You know what I mean? Like it ain't I. Don't care how good you are at acting. They're riding an ostrich or an emu at one of the points that's, hold on, just riding it. I mean I. Don't think you can get away with That these days. No, you can't. So it looks like it's either space balls. We gotta pick from These Kazam, this ERs. These are the ones I'm, I'm thinking right now. Space Balls. Kazam. Gimme your top two.

I've already watched I watch Heavyweights probably once a month. It's the best movie of all time. I Can't rewatch Heavyweights. It's so good. It's the best. It's by far the best movie on here. Next ERs Baseballs. I'll put this. Baseball's, I'll put baseballs up there. It's not really a kid movie, which ERs kind of what the reason We did this. But Baseballs I feel like we're gonna get way more references being older. And watching it. And. I haven't watched it in its entirety in a long time. So I'll go Baseballs. All right. And. Oh yeah, we said two. Yeah. There's just a lot of chick flicks. We got a lot of Swifties trying to make us watch bad movies. I'll go Baseballs And. Can we do Sister Act?


Do Sister Act too? I'm only doing Sister Act Two. How about Naked Guns. Baseball's, And, naked I Can't. I'll go Baseball's. And The Goonies. I've seen the Goonies And heavyweights because they're two like movies That people watch frequently, Right? right. I'm gonna say I mean it's I. Guess it's Space Balls. I was gonna say necessary roughness just to, I've Never seen That movie, which would actually bet pretty dope. That what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. Right? Let's throw necessary roughness in there. For sure. 'cause right. I. I've never even seen it. Yeah, I. Think I have like after I looked at the thing, I was like, maybe I have seen this, but I certainly don't remember it. Or any details. It's Like some type of college team. Necessary. Roughness, And, I.


Guess SCO Baseball's. Fuck it. You Know, bridged Jones. Diary. I mean I'll watch it. I don't have a problem with any of these. Jason. I'll watch whatever one. I don't have a problem with them either, but if We put one of these chick flicks on there, it's gonna fucking win. Sure. Fuck Alright. Which chick flick? We gotta do one Chick flick. And one. That We. All right, so necessary I. Just what ERs? Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants about like, it's just talking about Hand Me Down pants. That's the, that's the premise of the movie.

Alright Right. Now let's get to some Football How about That. Alright Right. Let's talk some Football. Let's kick things off with Travis's Game Chief. 17 Chargers 10. Oh yeah, How about That two high powered offenses. s Right. There We gotta talk about the game. You got any initial thoughts for us? I'll tell you what man. That Stadium ERs a It's SoFi's dope. Unique. Yeah. SoFi ERs so dope. And I. Think it's even cooler during the day because you get get the, the day games, you get the sun beaming through kind of like That, That plexiglass or whatever. That ERs over the top And. It just, it really light, like brings light into That Stadium like no other stadium I've been in, or at least no other dome I've ever been in.


That Place ERs. That Place was fun. And, it was rocking man. They had That. That was the first like Chargers game I had been to in a long time where their like fan base ERs starting to really get behind the key. Get the fuck outta here. I. Swear. You know, swear, there are more Chiefs fans there. Swear. Swear. Really Swear. We I mean Chiefs travel. But at the same time, like Chargers games are never That packed. Like Yeah, It's usually dominant whenever we play 'em. It's usually a Sea of Eagles fans. I'm not Gonna lie. Yeah, And. Then on top of That, it's not like packed to the T It's like That game was I the Eagles fans packed, Actually packed. Yeah. That thing was I mean. It was rocking I en I. Enjoyed the atmosphere. Cool. Obviously still a lot of things we gotta clean up on the offensive side defensively, man, we are, we are pretty damn stout right now out outside of That.


First drive for a, for a touchdown. And. The, the turnover That led to their their field goal. I. Think That. Our defense ERs the best in the league right now. And I just love Spags. And And. Everybody on That defensive side that's playing their tail off both in the run. And the pass game. Huge, huge fourth down stops. Week in, week out. Teams are just trying to dial up those That, extra That trying to dial up plays on And. And kind of steal an extra fourth down conversion on us. Late in the game. And keep control of the of the game. And trying to take the lead. And our defense just keeps coming up big. It happened in the Falcons game. It happened in the the Bengals game.


It happened in this game. And. It's just I. Mean I. Can't say how much, how much I appreciate these guys And, how hard they're working throughout the week to bet prepared for these kind of things. And. Yeah, but on the offensive side of the ball, man. We gotta we gotta get rolling And. It's not gonna bet any easier with seeing Rashi go down during the game. I just love the way That guy was playing the game of Football. How he was attacking every single day in practice. You know, sometimes you just root so hard for the guys. That, do it the right way. And Rashe had been doing That Man And. There was a huge dagger to me when, when I saw him go down, man. Yeah, outside of That found a way to, to get the ball in the end zone late. Running the hell of the running the hell out of the ball.


Our offensive line ERs our biggest weapon right now. Those guys up front are fucking paving the way tight ends included with Noah Gray And, my guy Jay Wiley coming in. And we're And And wide receivers doing their job in the run game. You know, ke going in there digging out safeties or just making blocks down field. You gotta find a way to to, to win ball games. And, sometimes it takes those little things. That, That don't to get the That don't to get like kind of the the highlight all the time. You know, for sure. Wide receivers going in, digging out safeties for an extra four or five yard to just doing enough to get the running back downhill. So, we can get the first down And then just running backs, running their tail offs, getting those extra two, three yards on on every single run.


And I couldn't bet happier for Kareem Hunt to come back. And have, you know, such a good game on his first game back in Kansas City, knowing everything That happened to him back in I. Think it was 2018. And. I. Just love That guy man. Another northeast Ohio ball player. That just loves to play the game. And does does it right man? Yeah, absolutely. It was awesome seeing Kareem back out on the field for you guys. Yeah, it was a great game for you. You got another one in the win column. I know you guys are still trying to click things offensively at a more efficient level, but Hey four. And Oh's four And. Oh And. We did get something going this past week. And That ERs the Big Yeti. The Big Yeti obviously had notably been struggling a little bit through the first three weeks.


Well, he finally gets going. He Was struggling in terms of stats. I was still playing winning. Football, And, That, That. That's all That fucking matters. Well. He still led all receivers with several receptions for Eighty. Nine yards. First drive of the game was the big 30 Eighty Yard reception. Let's check this out. First drive of the game, 30 Eighty yard reception. The big Yeti catches it over the shoulder. Beautiful ball by Pat Mahomes just Throwing dimes. There We go. Anyways, a lot of noise throughout the week. Jim Nance had, you're back on the broadcast all week. Hot takes. You gotta find something else to someone else to troll this week. I thought Andy said it best when he said I. Don't give a damn what anybody says essentially.


What did And say? Did you See That? I? He definitely said something in the press conference afterwards where it was like, yeah, all everything else ERs Noise. And I said it on here on the podcast last week. Everything outside of the building ERs. ERs just noise. Big game. What ERs it? Eighty just says what? ERs Eighty Nine yards a big game. It ERs a solid game. Yeah, like a big game ERs like I score a touchdown or something. If you don't go over the a hundred yard mark, it's not a big game for the bet. get just being honest, I'm not. Yeah, I. I mean I. I was accountable this game. I didn't have any drops, which was, you know what happened in Atlanta to make me feel like I had a bad game. But I, I I still didn't have an outstanding game.


There's a, there's a lot. That goes into having a great game, but I did have Seven catches, which ERs a lot of times you get the Rock And I got north with 'em. So yeah, it ERs what it ERs. Help my team find a way to win And. That ERs all That will ever matter For those of you That don't know Pat Mahomes ERs 13, And 12 in games. He's trailed by 10 what or more points. That's s Right. What the only quarterback with a winning record in such situations. What? Since at least 1950. Who The fuck was doing it back in 1950? It was the old gun slinger final way to make these comebacks After back when they were running the Wishbone, I didn't even know they had quarterbacks in 1950. He's also 12 And. Oh, the last 12 times ERs His app.


Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You can't say That. Okay. Yeah, sorry. Yep. Pat Helix a baseball player. Everybody knows baseball players a superstitious you Can't tell about Yeah, couldn't talk about Okay. Sorry. My fault. My fault. Keep moving. Keep moving, keep moving, keep moving. Early in the game. Rashish Rice. Oh man. Unfortunately injured on an interception return. A little friendly fire. I hate when That happens. The rest of the receivers did step up in Rashid's absence for the game. The most electric play of the game came in the second quarter. Pat connects with Xavier worthy, the rookie on a 54 yard touchdown. It was now 10 Seven going into the half per next gen stats. Pat's 54 yard pass to Xavier Worthy That. We're gonna show you. Right here traveled 62.2 yards in the air.


That's s right Mahomes iss longest completion by air distance of his career. I didn't know That I would've thought he would've thrown one That far to Tyreek Nice. Little throwback. For those of you That don't know what That ERs. It's when you act like you're naked. And out. You pull up And, throw back the direction of which you came. 'cause a lot of times on the Nakeds or boot action, everybody kind of you flows in the direction the quarterback's rolling out to. So these have been kind of hot this year. It feels like the throwbacks have been on everybody's radar. Yeah, I. Think We. We had been running the ball. So Well these first couple weeks. I think the the safety started getting a little bit more eyes in the backfield. And. Sure. Tell you what man, you take your eyes off of Xavier worthy man.


That guy ERs gonna bet past you in a blink of an eye. You Ain't lying. And. Yeah, And. He was absolutely flying on this one. Running at a top speed of 21.46 miles per hour, which ERs That. That'll get you a ticket in school zone kids. I was about to say the same thing. You too. That'll get you a speeding ticket that'll get you pulled over. Third fastest play by a ball carrier this season I. Think we saw one last night on Monday Night Countdown where Derrick Henry was fucking rolling going I. Think closer to 22 miles per hour. Which ERs fucking mind blowing That. A man That big can get moving That fucking fast. But Oh my goodness, X was flying on That.


One came up big And the later on in the game to seal the game off on the, on the final drive. Knowing That, we were trying to run the clock out there. Just can't say enough about what he's been for this offense so far. And. Just to see him keep growing in it. You know, becoming more And, more accountable every single week. It seems like the rookies finding more And, more of his place within the offense. Obviously Rice going down. He's being thrust into more plays. That, he was probably getting ready to perform in the game, but he sure answered the bell. Happy for him, man. And, if You guys stepped up in Pachecos absence ERs Well Kareem Hunt back in the KC uniform. And had 69 yards on.


14 carries Nice day for Kareem And running back. Er p Ryan came up big with the game winning touchdown. That's s right in the fourth quarter. It was also his first touchdown ERs. A Kansas City Chief Hey game winner. And your first touchdown. Shout out to some Maje man. If you watch this clip, man, you'll see my guy Trey Smith just absolutely bulldoze everybody because it comes, it, it becomes a bit of like a, a cloud of dust there for a second down there at the goal line. And. Then you just see six five just come in And, just bulldoze, just Zamboni Drive JE into the end zone there And. Give him That extra push All Right. Chris Jones And the defense. Another weak, another dominating performance by the Chief's defense who held the charges to 10 points.


And didn't allow a single point in the last 40 Eighty minutes. 53 seconds of the game. Yeah, I'm telling you ERs, the defense finished with five tackles for loss. 10 quarterback hits And. Two sacks both coming from none other than Stone Cold Jones. He didn't need to steal it this week. CEO O Got Em on his own baby. That's s right. Stone Cold Jones. Biggest play of the game came with four minutes left in the game. Third down, sax Justin Herbert forcing the Chargers to punt 3 26 left to play I. Think I. Remember seeing this? He got, was he at end on That one? I. Think so, man, he, that's the thing about this defense man. You got so many guys. That can rush the quarterback in so many different ways. They can get a guy. That plays typically plays the end And.


He can get inside. And make moves on a on a guard. And, a guy like Chris Jones who he can literally hurt you anywhere on the field when, when he ERs rushing the quarterback. And sometimes getting, getting the big man outside And giving him just the the edge to rush ERs. ERs a tackle's worst nightmare. Man, You guys did this a bunch. And, you brought both of 'em. This ERs what? I like. So you guys brought We So, we call it Flash in the game. I saw it brought multiple times, which ERs what we used to call the Will And. The free safety would blitz And, you'd bet a fire zone typically And you would rush five. That's like the conventional way of running like a wham blitz with the free safety in the will.


Yeah. Away from the Passeng And for everybody. For everybody. That doesn't un a fire zone Blitz ERs when you blitz five guys And, you play defense or play zone coverage in the back end with six. Yeah, Usually it's 3D three under con Well. Actually that's probably conventionally now everybody's doing it. And running palms behind it with like quarters quarter. Which ERs? Which ERs you're, you're protecting the deeper throw And forcing the quarterback to have to think quick on his feet on where he needs to go with the ball underneath. Meaning instead of the deeper routes, you throw it to the shorter routes And, the reason That That one ERs getting tricky ERs like because of what they do. Right here, they actually only brought four. So they make it look like it's gonna bet That same five guys rushing.


But really they're only gonna rush four And play like a conventional coverage behind it. So Herbert gets caught. You can tell like he thinks it's there. It's Tough. Also the running back does a terrible job. That's who got Chris the sack the running back missing. That. Blitzer got That. Guys are hitting it though, man. This ERs what Happens? They mug the guys up. And. They come. So then the run back's like I gotta bet firm in That Gap. Then all of a sudden they drop And. The safety's blitzing on the other side. And. They are And. You're To That one Our guys when they hit it now. Yeah. There's Xavier worthy in it. 21 miles an hour. Their speed. You ain't lying. Guys are flying in there. Either Way, Chris Jones gets a big sack towards the end of the game.


It doesn't seem like anybody can block him. I'm not just saying this. 'cause Chris has been good for a while. That, I. Dare I say he might bet the most impressive I've ever seen him right now do the first four weeks. He just feels like he's, anytime he's one on one, he's winning. I. Don't know. It's been impressive. Yeah. Especially if you're not getting the ball out on time. That's for damn sure. Chris ERs. Yeah, Chris ERs just, he's he's on the hunt man. He's, yeah, he's he I. The CEO was SAG Nation baby. Come on now. This don't, cold Jones. Don't do That voice. Sorry. Well. The, our guys, guys over at Waves got us some LeBron stats of the game. Sunday's game was the first time a reigning college, national championship winning coach faced off against the reigning Super Bowl winning Coach How about That.


Jim Ba Harbaugh was the national champion at Michigan last year. And ERs the Chargers sixth head coach since, since I've been in the league. Which ERs crazy. And to bet honest. He brought some of his staff from Michigan, which ERs a smart move. I mean you're comfortable with your guys. And, their defensive coordinator ERs a coach of mine. And. Jason's actually, That's s right. Actually his father. I I. Actually, Jesse's dad was a coach with me in Philadelphia. Rick, Rick Minner. And And. Rick was the, he was the head coach of Cincinnati before we got there. With Mark Antonio. Yeah. Back in.


Sorry. No. So, Jesse, Minter, And. I. Got to say what's up to him on the field. So when we were at Cincinnati, this ERs how this ERs how, you know, we're getting fucking on I say word, but Seriously what the guys That were Yeah, entrepreneurs. Go ahead. Go Ahead. So GA's are typically, the graduate assistants at colleges are typically the guys That. They do a lot of the, the, the I don't wanna say dirty work. 'cause That makes it seem like it's not a great I mean, that's what it ERs It's they's doing all the work. It, you're doing a lot of work. You're putting Excel sheets together. You're putting all the, all the film together. You're, you're basically doing all the tedious stuff. So That, the, the offensive And defensive coordinators can bet a little bit more focused on the bigger things. right. Well, they Wanna focus on the tape.


And, they wanna focus on the game planning. So the, the GA's end up doing, like, basically making all of the, the Scout team cards, they end up inputting a lot of the data into the computers. Like all of the back logging of everything the GA's are kind of in charge of. Yeah. All the organizational stuff. Yeah. And, it's a, it's really, it's a big piece in the, in the grand scheme of things when it comes down to it. And And Jesse was one of my favorite. I used to call him Coach Minner. Now That, he's a defensive coordinator in the, in the NFL. But no, He's, Jesse does I. He's not our coach. He's Jesse. He was literally holding up the, the scout team cards ERs I was a scout team quarterback my freshman year. That's Funny.


Which ERs hilarious. 'cause now he's game planning against me in the National Football League. 15 ERs later. And. Yeah. It's, it's, it was awesome to see though, man. And to bet. Honest That dude. I mean he has got shit figured out. Yeah. He's killing It. I mean I was talking to Pat And. There was one time in the game where it was a big third down I. Think And And. He, he put together a blitz That we had not seen before on, on tape. And. And got us, And got us pretty good there. But yeah, shout out to Jesse. He ERs he ERs absolutely killing it. Coach Minter couldn't bet. More proud to say That I was once your scout team quarterback And.


Yeah. Shout out to Mike Elson. I was about To say Mike. Coach Elon's on the staff too First. So, That was actually halfway through my, my redshirt freshman year. I started working with the tight ends to, to bet more in tuned with the offense And. They wanted to get me on the field, And some of the uptempo stuff. Coach Kelly wanted to get me on the field, And some of the uptempo stuff, blah, blah, blah. Coach Elson was te technically my first ever tight end coach come That, That I ever had And. I'll tell you what, he had a fun room. He was also the special teams coach And. We had a blast talking about a lot of the special teams guys. Yeah. Like Christian, McCafferty, And. Oh, oh, Colin McCafferty. Colin mcc McCafferty. Yeah, sorry. Like Colin McCafferty.


Yeah. And. Yeah. It was just, it was cool to see him. And. I. Couldn't bet happier for those guys. Not only getting the national championship this year, but doing a great job in, in LA with the Chargers this year, man. So it was pretty cool playing against That coaching staff. And, I got all the respect in the world for Coach Harbaugh ERs. Well. Did You talk to Jesse after the game? Did you see Him on the field? Yeah. I went up to him. And said, what's up to him, man? I said, How about us, huh? 15 ERs later. Look at us. Who would've thought? Who Would've thought, yeah. Who would've thought me Fucking up your cards. And. Fucking 2000. Hey Travis. Do this. Oh, I got you. I got you. Oh yeah. I Got you. I got you. About to make plays son. Yeah. Go over to the wide receiver And. Tell 'em to do something completely different. And.


Completely fuck the entire, like, I'm not, I'm not here to make the defense bet. I'm trying to shine baby Hey. These dbs think this route's coming. That's what they're game playing against ERs. Give 'em this. That's 100%. Oh my gosh. I. Remember being a Scouts team, the only thing ever when you're a start, your, it's the most annoying thing. Oh my God. It's the best shit ever. I was literally I, remember they didn't, they didn't like tell the d-line, don't sack the quarterback. They didn't tell the d-line to like, especially the scout team. The scout team qb. It was like, no, like, that's your job ERs to like, just eat shit for a year. Like, you're there to like bet bullied And. Man. Adam Hoppel used to fucking Had Hoppel great name Drop, used to like clothesline me.


So I told, so one day, I just had enough of it. And I was just like, I told the, the guard And Center That were That. He was lining up in front of I, was like, bro, just let him through And. They're like, what? I was just like, just do it just one time. Just do it. That. I got the snap outta shotgun. And I immediately just fucked. Like dodge ball. Just threw it right at him. Nah, dude. Like, not dodge ball, dude. He fucking Speared my shit, Dude. Yeah, it just came through. It just beat just like And after That just gave me a few, like, elbows to the fucking head. And. I was just like, I mean I deserved it, but fuck you. Yeah. Just, just I had to get at least one licking. Shout out to Hop man. Great dude. Same thing happened when I was a scout team defense back when I still played.


Middle linebacker. Yeah. We're doing a practice in, they used to let the offensive line cut the scout team guys. Like they never let anybody cut, but they would let those guys would bet. Cutting us at practice. And And. This ERs why Dantonio was great. This ERs this ERs why Dan Antonio was great. So they were cutting guys. And we're getting freaking mad. And Dantonio walked into the huddle. He's like, you're just gonna let 'em cut you guys. You're just gonna let these guys like do That to you. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. And. I'm like, fuck no, I'm not letting That. So next play I freaking Bobby Bouch shade it full on tackle Bradley glass hard tackle off drill And. He's like, Of course doesn't see it coming. This like, Yeah, I mean, because that's, yeah.

Got got me the scout team player of the year, boy, defensive player Of the year. Boy, And a boy. We went to Hawaii That year. And I was a part of the scout team. That That got invited to Hawaii. There you Go. Got me on the plane. Maybe ERs This a LeBron stat. Travis officially passes legendary tight end Tony Gonzalez to become chief's all time leader in receptions when he caught his 900 And 17th career reception. I have a news to say this ERs not a LeBron stat. That ERs an all time stat. It's, yeah, it's a pretty, pretty legit stat.


Especially Considering who held the stat previously. Yeah. And, what he's meant to the game of Football in the tight end position. This ERs a milestone stat And. Congratulations Trav I know you're a humble guy, but That ERs incredible to see, to bet. Honest with you, when we were watching Tony do it, I, don't think anybody felt And. I still feel like most of his records aren't gonna bet broken, Like Untouched. It's so freaking crazy when you look at his career stats. But to even touch something That he did with the chiefs ERs, mind blowing in itself. It's crazy how it, how it all comes full circle, man. Yeah. Not only being in conversations with Tony, but being at the top of the leaderboard with the Kansas.


City Chiefs who have been around since the sixties, have been such a un unbelievable organization in the National Football League. One of the, one of the beginning organizations. That made it all the way through. That are still, you know, at their peak. And. I, just I, I, I, I love Kansas City, And, the Chiefs And, the opportunity That. I've had here in KC And, a lot of That ERs ERs due to the rich history. That. They have And And. A guy like Tony Gonzalez, who has been a mentor to me. ERs. He ERs been right there, a lifeline. If I ever needed it. I fucking love the guy. He's, he's motivated me in ways. That, he doesn't even know. And, I, I I. Just, I've tried my entire career to match what he was to this organization.


What he was to this, to this game of Football And to bet in conversations. Not to say That, I, I Am ERs good ERs, Tony. Not to say That. I've surpassed Tony to bet in a conversation. ERs. ERs cool ERs. This having ERs many receptions in the, in the organization. That. He spent the majority of his career. And. It's just an honor man. And. And. Tony I. Love your brother. And. It's I. Just I. Can't thank you enough for who you are. ERs a person. And, who you've been in my, in my career, And, I've, I've taken everything you've learned. You've, you've taught me And. I've ran with it, man. And. I've, I've tried to, I've tried to become bet because of it. And. Yeah. Just love That guy, man.

I didn't even know I was gonna bet. Showing on television. I don't know you're dressed ERs. Jason, Kelsey, I. Guess you had to kick your feet up onto the desk to show the world the Timms.


My Dog wore some butters on Monday Night Countdown. Don't to get it twisted, man. Everybody knew if you lace those things up at Heights, you were getting fucking smoked. You were getting clowned ERs soon. ERs you walked through the door. I have since learned That. You can't lace up your butters. You just gotta bet. Willing to get fucking smoked.

Those are Good old wranglers. We also got this shot of you And I. Need you to explain exactly what was going on your first ever word spoken on e S. PN Monday. Night Countdown was, had tits in it.


And. Now you are showing your tits essentially on this future. True. It's true. Yeah. I. So, hold on, let Me, you're very tan tense. Yeah. Somebody asked me what complexion this was. I was like, Don. Don't know guys. I'm just, He used a bronzer. We, We were doing a segment on Hutch Island talking about how Oh yeah, Yeah. Hutch. Yeah. They find out how to get Hutch One-on-ones. And build them into overload fronts. And different. Put 'em wide. So That, you can't really chip 'em. And. And. The guard has trouble getting out to help. So, yep. We were doing the island vibe. So Marcus Spears had my ties made. He had hats. And Sunglasses.


And. Then this shirt, I. Don't know whose idea this shirt was, but it was handed to me. And. I was just showing off my new shirt. Nice. It makes sense. I honestly didn't even know what it was when I was holding it up until it was like already at That Point. And. Then I looked down. I was like, oh, Okay. Alright. right. Nice perfect Well. The head And glasses really made it a full get up. So you Were Yeah. And. The floaty jumping get You're dressed ERs. Hutch Island. Yeah. Yeah. So fits right in I. Love the jacket. I thought this was one of the most entertaining, you know, pre-game. Countdowns. That. You guys had Don to date. You guys spoke upon, spoke about even Tua And, the concussion stuff. That. He had been going through And. How? How was he gonna have to weigh That?


It was such an educated conversation between the three of you guys. And, S, VP I. Just really love everybody's input. Everybody has a very different view of things. And. You guys are just I. Just love the the Don. Don't know the camaraderie. You guys got up there, man. It's cool. It's fun to watch I. Appreciate That. We're getting bet. And bet. You know, I think it's, you know, we're on our fourth time doing it together. Which ERs crazy. That. You know, we're doing this every single week. Live And. You're still figuring out how it all works together. But it's been helpful to me to bet on there with guys. That have been doing it at a high level for so long. You know what I mean? Like And know what they're doing. Like I can lean on. Ryan I can lead on swag. I can lean on Scott.


You know, they're the veterans right now. I'm the freaking scout team player of the year. Ooh, Nice Nice. Go ahead. And fucking steer your starting left tackle. Yeah, dude, I gotta get Ryan's I. Gotta get rcs fucking suit connect. Man. Those suits are looking fucking Sharp, dude. It's ridiculous. I don't even know what it ERs. They're looking. Sharp. Sharp. Only a special guy could make That exact suit. So I gotta get his connect. But what ERs That style called That. He's Wearing. You're gonna have to ask RC Man. I. Honestly, I don't know. But it looks smooth. It looks smooth. The lapel ERs very different. It ERs, bro. It was clean. Very clean. Alright. Right. Let's talk about the rest of the storylines coming outta the NFL from week four. We're gonna start with Eagles. Go down in Tampa.


Do we have to talk about this? We gotta talk about this. Oh yeah. We're definitely talking about this. We're half Eagles. Half chiefs, man. So box 33 Eagles, 16 Jason. Go ahead. And, tell us your initial thoughts. I. Never go into a game. Not expecting the birds to win. I always, for some reason. And still going into a game. Think the birds are going to perform. Well. And win the game. That being said, I was nervous going into this game. And. I was nervous 'cause We were missing. AJ Brown, And, Devonte Smith. And. We. Were going up against a coordinator. And, Todd Bowles, who when you are missing key players, can take away certain parts of the game if you're one dimensional.


That being said, I was not anticipating us playing so bad on both sides of the Football. That early. Like we had two, three And outs. And before we blinked. It was 21. Nothing in the first half. You know, I think they, they both sides just really struggled to start the game offensively. There were some drops. The runs. That we called didn't really work. And, you know, We got sacked on one of 'em. And. It just like we got off to a really slow start. And. Then defensively, I just, you know, partially credit to Tampa Bay for really seeing stuff on film. And taking advantage of some of the soft coverages.


That, I think we had been playing And right off the get go. You just saw Baker ripping the ball into the flat. We had a Miss tackle early from my guy Yte And. It just felt like we were giving them a lot of yardage, And. Then after That, it just was like a cascading event. Like We couldn't stop the run. It felt like we were nervous to go And attack guys. And then it felt like they were just hitting the ball in behind. Like, it just felt like they could do whatever they want. It was And, I think they set it up right from the get go. They, they knew That. That was there. And, they hit That. And. They're like, no, you're gonna have to defend this area. And. It felt like We just struggled from there. And part of it's like, listen, BAK played out of his mind. He ERs playing great fucking Football.


Like, Dude, he, he's playing lights out this year. I know he struggled against Denver last week, but it turns out it looks like Denver's pretty damn good. Not defense, but it I mean Bakker. It just felt like, especially to start the game he could've missed. He was throwing the ball perfectly. My manlays s right on the receiver on like a post route And. He just puts it in the perfect spot for a touchdown. He wasn't the dealer. Baker was the freaking pit boss. Like he was controlling the entire thing. It was impressive to watch, to bet. Honest with you. Yeah. But. yeah. We gotta play Bet defensively. I mean there's no mistake. Like we gotta play Bet on both sides. I don't want to like single out the defensive side. Yeah. Offensively there were obviously guys missing.


So it's kind of easier to understand why they struggled defensively. We gotta get That figured out offensively. We. At least gotta do bet than We did. I, we had zero yard at I. Forget what the stat line was at one point. It was like zero yards to like 200 And 50. Like it was something outrageous. At one point in the first half, the bucks had 200 And, 55 total yards of offense. While the Eagles had zero I mean bro, I don't think I've ever even heard of That. But It happened so fast like We did. We had this ERs what it was. We had three, three And outs And before We knew it. Like it was like That. It was an insane start to the game. I mean the most one-sided start to a game I've seen in a long time. I mean you wanna talk about an insane stat. I'm like, it's like becoming more like in my head.


The more I. Think about it. Like, what the fuck you guys, you guys went down 24, nothing in the middle of the second quarter. And we're never able to really get back. But You know how it ERs. Like here's, here's the reality. We on first, And second, like, dude, if you're missing AJ Brown, Devonte Smith. You bet, bet. Good on first. And. Second down. And on first. And second down, we had drops. We had a, we. The runs didn't really hit because Todd was bringing corner cat. 'cause he didn't like, they were like, you bringing a corner cat into the run. And, the safety's coming down. Like it's gonna bet hard to run the ball into That. Look. Yeah. Like the runs weren't working. We had the, the passes we did call, like we had a couple drops. We ran a screen. That didn't That I think got dropped or didn't work. We got sacked.


You can't bet in third And long. You can't bet in third And long against a team like That without your best two players. It's just gonna bet dang near impossible, tough Sledding. They were playing cover one. They're doing pick stunts with the running backs guy. Like, good luck passing off That. Stunt I know everybody in Philadelphia's frustrated. I was frustrated watching it I. Damn sure know the guys out there were frustrated. Yeah. And pissed. Yep. And one of their biggest leaders. Brandon Graham actually called a team meeting on the sideline. And And I mean we don't gotta talk about it. Everybody knows BG ERs the heart of That team. He ERs the hard And soul. He ERs a guy that's been there for fucking ERs. BG ERs still playing at a very high level.


Hell yeah. He ERs he shouldn't even bet playing the amount of snaps he's playing with where he's at in his career. Probably. He's doing anything he fucking can to get this team to win. Yeah. He has to And. He knows That And. He's, It's a, it ERs early. It's, it's four weeks into the year. I still think they have talent to improve things. Yeah. They have fucking talent. Hell yeah. They fucking have talent. I still think they have a talent to improve things. Vick's been in this league for a long time. He's gonna bet on these guys to get these things fixed, figured out. I know Nick ERs gonna bet on both sides of the ball. And, you know, I know everybody's on Jalen. Obviously Jalen didn't play Well, but It's, it not, it doesn't sound like anybody really played That great. But That's what I'm saying.


I don't want to single out him The offense struggled. And the offense struggled a lot because of the guys That were out And because they weren't like, when they were good on first, second down, they had a couple good drives. But like, once they got into those long situations, like it's, that's just gonna bet hard if you don't have the horses. Yes. It ERs about AJ And. Devonte being like physical freaks of nature. And great receivers. It's also just about like chemistry, And timing, And having reps with guys. Like That's what it's more about. We just got Johann Dotson, like he has only been here for like a few weeks. Couple weeks. Yeah. So like, it's just frustrating to watch And. It's, it's, it's hard to execute in those situations.


There's no magic formula to to fix it other than you just gotta go to fucking work. And bet. Willing to to bet your own worst critic. Yeah. To not make it a single fucking excuse And. You know, just go out there And. Find a way. And have a mentality together. Find a way to have everybody on the same fucking page. That. You guys are gonna get this thing Don I. Think this ERs gonna bet a motivating tool for, for the guys in That building. 'cause everybody gives a fuck. You know what I mean? Yeah. There's not, there's not too many non-com competitors in That building. So I expect everybody to, to figure it out, man. So shout out to the birds, but the LeBron stat of the, the game. Jalen Hertz has 43 career, regular season rushing touchdowns tied with Steve Young for the third most rushing touchdowns by a quarterback in the NFL history.


Only Cam Newton 75. Holy shit. And Josh Allen have more. Josh Allen already has more. My God. I. Think I actually remember hearing That. He fucking surpassed him last week or two weeks ago. Week five next week, the Eagles are on a buy. Then they come back week six at home versus the Browns How About That. You hate to go into a buy after a game like That, but who knows? Maybe it'll bet a Nice little fresh start for everybody to come back. Motivated And ready to fucking rock the Eagle's. Next four games are against teams with a combined three And 13 record. Yeah. Don Sleep on That, which absolutely means nothing. Do nothing, do not sleep on That The Bengals Absolutely means nothing.


The bangles are The fucking man. Thes have in every game. That, they've been in, they've been damn near winning them. The Jags, The Jags have some guys. They had The rough game against Buffalo. That. I saw on Monday night. I expected 'em to put up a bet. Performance And. They put a goose egg up on me. But they still got some, they, they've been close. They should have won I mean, CJ got it Don at the end of the game, but they're right there against Houston last week. The Giants like, they're not great, but they're in all these games. Don don't know if we have the, if we even have the Giants Cowboys. Thursday Night That was the weirdest freaking division game I've ever seen watching. It was like, neither team really was like fighting to win. Did you feel That way? Did you watch it? I Watched it, but I was more interested in the pre-game. And And halftime talk.


Really? Just because I love those guys. Do you Love Big Witt, And, And, Fitzy, And, all those guys. Big Wit Tony. Fit m you know it. Yeah. Yeah. Carissa, they're, they're, they're one outside of you guys. They're my favorite. Yeah, they're, they're fantastic. But I I, like, it just felt like nobody was like taking the game. It felt like both teams were like kind of playing conservative And. Just hoping the other team messed up. Yeah. And then like nobody messed up. So it was just like this weird game where like, nobody played good or bad. I. Don't know. It was very, it was very strange. Yeah, it was eerie. The Browns game. Yeah, the Browns are playing bad right now, but they got Jim Schwartz. Honestly, there were a call here, And there away from winning last week against the Raiders Alright. right. Week four, round up. Let's talk about all the big headlines from the rest of the league.


Three undefeated teams lost this week. There's only two undefeated teams left I. Think you know one of 'em. The other one. That ERs still undefeated are the Minnesota Vikings. The three undefeated teams That Lost this week are the Steelers, Seahawks, And Bills. I. Didn't I mean we gotta talk about the Bills. Ravens game. I did not see the bills struggling this much. I mean the Ravens are a tough matchup for 'em. Heck, they're a tough matchup for anybody. If freaking Derrick Henry's rushing like That. Oh My God. The Big man, the king himself had a hundred And 99 yards rushing And. One rushing touchdown, a receiving touchdown. Don't see That every day from the big man. One of those touchdowns came off of an Eighty Seven yard run in which he reached over 21 miles an hour.


That's s right. He was speeding in the school zone. The Ravens won this game. 35 to 10 against a Buffalo Bills team. That looked pretty much unbeatable the week before against the Jacksonville Jaguars. It was an amazing show of feet by the Ravens who seemed to bet finally figuring out this new piece they got at running back with Derrick Henry. Combined with Lamar Jackson And the rest of the other fast guys. They got on on the perimeter. It, it feels like they do so much misdirection, but still manage to play with insane Speed. Tough Football. Yeah. The last undefeated team That took their l was the Steelers. Yep. The mighty, mighty Steelers. That defense has been so good, but they struggled early against the Indianapolis Colts getting out to a, a slow start.


The Colts, they start out 14 or 17, nothing I. Can't remember whether it was I. Think it was a 17 nothing lead or was a 14. Nothing I couldn't tell you all I know ERs. That. Joe Flaco came in there at 39 ERs. Old And played his tail off. Again. He Did. Anthony Richards was playing pretty Well too. He got 'em the first touchdown. And then worked them down in the red zone. Flaco finished That one off to make it 14. And. Then Joe did the rest. I will say Fields And the Steelers And company, once they figured it out, were humming, but it was a little bit too little too late. Yeah. Still, still a good Football team though. Steelers A good Football team. So are the Colts. Colt's got a really good defense. And. It's been That way. I don't know what Anthony Richardson's injury status ERs, but Joe Flacco has proven That.


He ERs still an unbelievable quarterback, especially after last season's. Browns end of the season. That, he finished off with That playoff run after the game. Flaco was told by a reporter. That. Anthony Richardson thought he was cooler than he expected him to bet. And Flacco's response was Anthony Richardson's mom ERs Eighty days older than I am. So there's no chance in the world he thinks I'm cool. And, I'm here to say Flaco comments like That are exactly why Anthony Richardson thinks you're cool. Three rookie quarterbacks led their teams to wins in week four. Don. Don't know That. You would call Bo Nicks' week an outstanding week from him. 10 to nine ERs a wild ass fucking NFL game Jets.


Jake, we gotta bring jets. Jake in on this. I'm Pretty sure he had negative 60 yards of offense or something like That. No, think about this. Before That at halftime, I think he had negative Seven yards. Dude on Seven on six receptions or some shit like That. I. Don't think I've ever seen That. Many receptions. And. Somebody have negative yards. And throw a a lot of, I'm not calling Bo Nicks bad or anything like That. I'm just saying That ERs a wild stat to fucking look at at halftime. We could go into another wild stat here. And Ed ERs the rookie phenom. That's s right. Phenom Jayden Daniels. This dude ERs unbelievable man. He ERs fun to watch. The stat in particular, That, everyone seems to bet bringing up ERs, the Eighty 2.1% completion.


That's Do four games. Ladies and gentlemen. It's the number one all time through four games. It might bet a LeBron Snap, but That ERs a damn good LeBron Snap. That's fucking, there's one you can hang your hat on. That's the one right there. And it. It's what's been unique ERs the first game for sure. It was all Dinkin, And, dunking And. The ball was out quick. And, he ERs still getting That ball out quick. He's got a quick trigger. Yeah, But now you're seeing And. Part of it might bet defenses have seen That. And. They're, it's forced them to defend, Reacting to it. Yeah. You're seeing him take the shots down the field. You're seeing him make the big throws to McClure And End Doubt. Yeah. I was gonna say And to his receiver's credit. They're making these fucking plays, man.


Yeah, they are making big time plays. Zach, Zach Ertz baby Zach ERT out there making fucking plays. Baby I was just talking to my boy. They listen. They are having fun right now. These last two weeks have been a coming out party for this offense. Cliff Kingsbury has 'em rolling Jayden Daniels man I don't know if he's gonna bet the next CJ Stroud, the next Pat Mahomes I like About it. Daniels man. There's Something I like about watching it. Like it. There's a poise. There's a, there's a personality. Personality Man. There's excitement. Yep. Like he's confident. Ah, man. I love watching him play. You use one of my favorite words on Monday Night. Countdown. His moxie.


Yeah. Fucking moxie. What Andy call it. What does Andy call it? Don Don't Know. Doesn't he call it like vibrato or what ERs he Oh My gosh. Vibrato. Helix call. He says it instead of swagger, he uses another term. And. It's like a old school term or he did in Philly. I. Have no idea. I've never heard him say any of those words either way though. Man. The guy. He's got the Moxie Man. And. He, he's got the bull by the horns over there. Cliff Kingsbury dialing the shit up against His former team. Are. you kidding me? Yeah. You could tell they were, they were taking some good shots. You got the game ball. I'm happy ERs hell for my, my two guys. Man. I missed the hell out of these two guys. Nick, Allegretti, And, Andrew Wiley, two of my favorite teammates of all time. And. You heard Andrew say ERs he's having one of the most fun ERs of his life playing for That team And.


Sometimes the, the, the excitement. And, that's not the take away from anything That we did here in kc. The excitement of everybody not necessarily counting you in, maybe not counting you out, but not counting you in And to bet able to date week in, week out. You know, Don. Don't know. Answer. That test. And, And, And. Do it in a way. That. They're doing it, man. It looks like they're having fucking fun over there in Washington right now. Hitting on all cylinders, man. And I just could I. Couldn't bet happier for those two guys for sure. And on top of That Cliff Kingsbury. Who I, who I know through old Pat Mahomes man. Yeah. Jayden Daniels ERs taking the NFL by storm right now. And. Hopefully we get to keep watching That because it's exciting to watch, especially when a young guy And a team are dominating like That.


Oh yeah. And. The last rookie quarterback to get a win column this week was Caleb Williams, where Da Bears That got their second win of the season. He clearly played his best game so far. Hopefully he can keep on getting That thing moving over there in Chicago. I think everybody's ready for a Chicago Bears Football team to bet. Damn good. No fun league. This week we saw another flag for a celebration. That really put the no Fun league in perspective. This ERs ridiculous. This ERs Jet's wide receiver Al Lazar celebrated a 12 yard reception for first down with finger guns. P-P-P-P-P. I know We don't want this to bet like, oh NFL players shooting guns And to get That.


But unless this ERs so subtle, unless you're like doing it at a defender, it shouldn't bet a flag. If you wanna find the guy after the game for doing it all, I, whatever, that's up to the NFL for wanting to protect their league. But I I think it ERs absolutely ridiculous. That, a guy ERs on the ground shooting, pointing fingers for getting a first down saying, we're going That way. Or you know what I mean? Whatever he might bet doing. I. Just think it's too much man. It's too much And. It's affecting the, it's affecting the game in the wrong way to get the guy's gotta play by the rules. And stuff like That, but I just I I I. Don't want to get the NFL on my ass for saying something, but I just think this ERs too far.


No, You're Right. It's my second amendment. I have the right to bear arms. You don't have the Right to shoot it people though. Which ERs why they should make it taunting if you direct it at a player one. Yeah, an official a fan. Like if it directed at somebody, like if it ERs Don to like do anything to a person taunting I agree. It should bet taunting. But if you're just doing it like, ha blah blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm shooting guns up in the sky. What the hell are We doing? How's That ting? If, if, If the league doesn't want it, just find 'em afterwards. Don't make it a part of the game where it like affects the team. I. Think it's a little too much for That. But. Yeah. They've Don this to like overcompensate, like people pointing it at people And like, or like to bet like Don Don't know.


It's stupid. It's dumb. It's dumb. That. This cost them 15 yards. There was nothing about this. That was remotely Violent. It was playful. Look at him. Okay. He's probably making pew pew. Pew sounds ERs he does it. Pew, pew, pew. Pew. Pew. Pew, pew. Who ERs That. Who ERs That. Kevin Hart ERs That. Yeah. Earlier this season. Bengals wide receiver. Andre Yoshis was also fine for a bow. And arrow. Yeah. We talked about this one already. Listen, Trav, you've been the king of bow And arrows. I thing. I. Don't do it during the game though. It's though thing I think it's the same thing. Well, you, you have Don it before. You don't do it anymore during the game. No, you're Right. You've, I've seen you do it.


ERs a, a celebration before when it wasn't a penalty. Yeah, right. Yeah. I think it was like 2016 or something. Like That. Yeah. That made it a flag. I I always thought That was bogus. But I haven't Don it in the field of play during the game. I've Don it like ERs I come out of the the tunnel And stuff. But does It feel like the league ERs cracking down on celebrations? No. They've kind of already had these rules. I mean the, the gun, the like weaponry rule has been in place since what? Like 2016 or something like That or 2019 whenever it went into place. It's not a new rule, it's just That. People are seeing 'em And seeing how absurd it ERs. Especially when it's not like there was a guy That did like a full on AK 40 Seven at a guy like That one to get, let's not let a guy AK 40 Seven another player.


But like little pew pews or like a bow And arrow up in the sky. That aren't directed at people. I think We can let That slide. Like what happens if you do a slingshot? There's a slingshot allowed I. Don't know. I might try it. Oh, I might try That one. See if to get fucking 15 yard penalty. What About you can, you can still do a sword. You can come out And. Do like a little And sheet. It Zora allowed. That's allowed, right? A Zorro. What kind of weapons aren't allowed? NFL I Know I Anything can bet a weapon. I had to appeal a fine for giving a a teammate of mine. ato Cold stunner. Did the teammate submit a complaint to hr? No. It was just after a touchdown. And. The, the NFL saw it. And said I was a violent act. And when, but the teammate was in on it.


Yeah. I tell you what. I Stone coach Stunner a friend in a bar. And. He was not in on it. And. He was upset about it. I thought it was like electric. You, You are fucking ridiculous though. You will break somebody's fucking back stuttering somebody. You, there's no like InBetween. I'm not half You. Full throttle. Listen, I'm going straight. Kick to the nuts. get him hunched over exposed for breaking this guy's neck. Wasn't an electric move. Shout out this just Don. Hold stunner himself. Steve Austin, the rattlesnake. What's another weapon? That we could tow the line with here? What's a we what's a mm I Think slingshot. Slingshot. And sword. S Slingshot sword are pretty good. Could you set up like a catapult catapult system?


And catapult the Football into the crowd. No. I. Don't think that'll hit I mean. If it goes into the crowd, it's probably gonna bet. What's another Numchuck? Numchuck would bet. Pretty funny. Could you act like you put your head in a guillotine? And Just like get into Cap potato. Oh my gosh, that's crazy. Throwing star I. Don't think people would get the gist. Throw Nunchucks. Could you do little Michelangelo, Michelangelo? You didn't go Bruce Lee. You went Michelangelo. I'm all teenage mu Ninja Turtles. Baby I. Don't go. Who's this Bruce Lee cat? You wore him on your shirt One day. I love Bruce Lee. I'm just fucking But I don't Bruce Lee I. Don't think of Nunchuck. I. Think of Michelangelo. When I think of Nunchuck. When I think of Nunchucks I. Think of Bruce Lee playing Ping Bong with nunchucks.


He played Bruce I. Don't remember That clip. That's awesome. That's Pretty cool. I think it's CG I, but I Believe it probably ERs. Who cares? They had CGI I back then. No, that's why it makes it gave him more like, kinda like really Alright. Right. Let's get out of it. What if You, what if you did a poisoned chalice? You took a drink from the poisoned chalice I. Think we're just I. Think we're I. Think we're Don with this. Ooh, Blow dart Ace Ventura spear. Ja That was javelin. Wasn't it? Spear. It was javelin, right? And. Now for a new addition to round up the week we got coach quote of the week. I've been waiting to do this ever since I sat down with Nick Saban at an e S PN event.


Sometimes coaches just say it best. Trav hit Me during the post post game press conference. Falcon's head coach Raheem Morris was asked about tight end. Kyle Pitts not getting any catches in the game this week. And Morris responded. It was just about going out there. And winning the game. Stats are for losers, man. I don't to get involved in That stuff. Our stats officially for losers. I, I. Don't think they're for losers. I. Think when you're getting good stats, you're you're helping your team win And when you do it at a, at a consistent level. And, you're scoring touchdowns, And, you're winning Football games. They do matter. But I hear what he's saying though. Yeah.


And. It's And. It's a part of my philosophy. And not being upset. That, I'm not getting buku stats this year. ERs That. It's, it's about winning the Football game. And, he's, he's focused on wins. And, losses. And. Speaking of stats, we got a pretty crazy one from the, from That game. Falcons beat the Saints 26, 24 on Sunday. And. The Saints became the first team to score at least 24 points. Allow no offensive touchdowns. And lose in 40 ERs. Allow no defensive touchdowns. Allow no offensive touchdowns. Oh, like no, like pick sixes or anything. No. No offense. What does That mean? They didn't allow the other team to score a touchdown.


How'd they get all their points? A defensive touchdown. Maybe. Special teams. Field goals. Field goals. Yeah. That's a That ERs. Fucking outrageous. Isn't That crazy? Listen, This ERs my viewpoint on stats. Talk to me. Stats are numbers. What I care about? Okay ERs. The Football. Where does it go? Does it go in the end zone? Do we get points? Points are also numbers, but points determine games. And wins. And losses. Sure. Stats are numbers. Numbers are nerds. Nerds are losers. Therefore, stats are losers. If you care enough about stats for it to change your day, I think that's when you have a, you don't have a winning mentality.


Yeah. So to get what coach Morris ERs saying. But at the same time, if you're putting the ball in the end zone, you're gonna get stats. It ERs what? It's Yeah, but you're not counting the stats. You're just counting the points. You're not counting the stats. You're just Counting the points. All We care about ERs. Visually. Does That Ball go into That territory? Right there. Yep. We get points. Does That ball go through Right? And? What's That mentality when we're on defense? Does the ball go That way or does it stay where it's at? That's all I care about. That's you're Right. I Don't care about the numbers. You're right. But at The same time, numbers are for the analytics people. When you get the ball in the end zone, And The pencil butchers. When you're getting the ball in the end zone. And the Zi, the zit faces. When you're getting the ball in the end zone, you're getting the stats. And, The four eyes. It ERs what it ERs. I will say this, Cal pits ERs a fucking unbelievable athlete.


Great Football player. I think trying to get the ball in his hands ERs a pretty good, pretty good plan for the, for the Falcons. Yeah. All serious. Seriously. They should probably get his stats up. 'cause he ERs a really good weapon to utilize it. That's, that's, that's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. And, he's one of their bet. You know, he's just, he's just, he's an unbelievable like athlete out there on the field. Hey, I think he has a lot of Mises. Hey. Maybe if Kyle Pitts has some catches, they actually do score an offensive touchdown. That's another way to look at it. See? There we go. Before we get outta here, let's wrap up the show with no dumb questions because there's no such thing ERs dumb questions. 92 Percenters. Just dumb ass people answering 'em. Hey.

What ERs a favorite piece of Football sports memorabilia. That. You guys own hits. I. Can't tell you exactly what I own, because then I, somebody would rob my house for it. But I got some good shit. I got some good shit. And. I'm very proud of it. One of the coolest items. That. I have That. I've actually, I've had right here on my desk since Jason Got it for me. Don't say That one. Don't say That one ERs a Babe Ruth. Baby Ruth. Grade nine, which ERs outta 10. It's a pretty goddamn good grade. Yeah, it's got a babe, baby Ruth signature Baseball right here from back in the day.

It's just like ingrained in my head. Did you, did you ever get anybody to sign a baseball when you were younger?


Like the satisfaction of it? I went. And waited in the Cleveland Indians parking lot. I mean We did That after every fucking game. That, And, I. But one time I, believe I did get a Kenny Lofton autograph on the third base line. I was sitting there with I I think I'm remembering this right? 'cause the sailors had third base season tickets. And. I got to go with him one time. And, they would come right by his section. Every warmup And, he would like sign some autographs. Shout out to Kenny Lofton. Man, I've been fortunate enough to say what's up to him. And And. And bet. Cool with him. And. He's just been the absolute best knowing. That. We were nineties Cleveland kids. And just thought the fucking world.


And still do man. But Kenny I still gotta I. Still gotta come out. And play some golf with you. Jason will probably join now. That, he's a golfer. So. We'll, we'll have to put a round together. I I did the exact same thing. I got Kenny Lofton, And Davis, David Justice at a 1990. Seven, MLB Allstar game Took me. You got them at That game. Yeah. Dad took me down there. And. I. Remember when you got to go down with dad? We had two tickets. You guys had fun. That was great. Yeah. You went the year before. So That something. Not the Allstar game. We never, there wasn't like an Allstar game every year in Cleveland, Travis. Yeah. You didn't even like baseball though. Dead knew. I would've fucking appreciate it more. And I would remember it more. And.


I did. And. One of the coolest things I got was a picture of Kenny Loftin in a Atlanta Braves jersey. And hat. Because 1990 Seven, we traded him right before the deadline to get I. Believe. David Justice, if I'm, if I'm not mistaken, I Don't remember who we got, but That sounds right. I guess. Yeah. I. Forget exactly who we traded for. Oh no. Marquis Grissom was a part of That one. Mm. Fun times. And. Shout out to Kenny. My Favorite piece of sports memorabilia ERs actually very timely because this person just passed away Monday night while I was doing Monday Night Countdown, which made it hit extra hard.


Well. At least that's when the news broke. Yeah. Pete Rose I have assigned baseball by Pete Rose. Charlie Hussle himself, man, And, I, Don. Don't know. I've just always been a huge Pete fan. Obviously he had his demons, but the way he played the game, And carried himself And I. Think also like Dad just loved him. So That made me love him a little bit more. So I love That piece of memorabilia. That will probably mean more now. That there won't bet, bet any more of a made I. I've, I've had a, I've had a lot of people run into, to Pete before he passed And. They just had the world. They, they said, they just said great things about him. Either way, R I P to the big guy. And That. That ERs a very, very cool piece of memorabilia. That, you got, what else do you got?
