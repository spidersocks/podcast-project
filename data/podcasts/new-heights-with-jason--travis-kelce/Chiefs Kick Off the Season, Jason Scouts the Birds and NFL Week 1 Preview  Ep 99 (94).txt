Listen, Listen. I'm all for the democratic process. All for the democratic process. But when you have a bunch of people voting And, they don't understand what the rules are, then I'm not for it.

Cameras. You gotta watch out, man. You can't stare those things in the eyes. They'll spit on you. I. Think llamas do the same thing they do.


They're known for That. Yep. Llamas are fun to like watch prance around. Do Llamas serve a purpose? Yeah. I. Think all animals in the animal kingdom serve some Well. No Well. I mean like a hippo. It doesn't really do shit. What ERs? A A llama. A hippo makes sure That. Everybody stays in line. Yeah. They're hungry. And. Then they make for a great board game. What ERs the So llamas. What do llamas do? Fucking Love hungry Animal. They provide meat. And milk. So people eat llamas. I'm not eating llamas. And. I'm not drinking their milk. I knew. I figured you could make, you could use it's wool. Yeah. That's which it looks like people. That's where I'm, yeah. I leather People make llama leather I.


Think that's a little fucked up. What's the, what's the one That. Louis Vuitton ERs. Louis Vuitton making some llama pus lama Leather. Peter would be on their ass if they were doing That. Dude. Candles. Llama fat ERs used for making candles. Ah, Yeah. right, right. Well, It's kind of disgusting. Shout out to the Minnesota State Fair. Didn't know We had Chiefs Kingdom up there. Man. Travis. Kel Llama did not win it. It lost the costume contest to the champion. Emerson Croft And. Her llama macchiato scene here. It was a watermelon. I came in second place. You came in second place behind the watermelon llama. Which if, I'm gonna be honest, I think the watermelon s more creative I mean. Look at That costume.


That's a pretty, that's A I. Mean I. Think that's better. That's a person that's not a llama. Well the The llama ERs to the left of the person. Well. That doesn't look like a watermelon at all. That's a sliced up. That's like the sliced watermelon. I mean I agree though. It doesn't really look like a watermelon. Yeah. She's got the better watermelon outfit. Shout out to all the llama contests out there. Maybe that's a bad view of the llama though. Maybe at a different angle. It kind of looks more like a watermelon. Everyone who would've thought That there would be a costume contest for llamas. What Other animals I mean? There's gotta be like a Dog costume competition. Nope. Never heard of it. No, just llamas. Only llamas. Yeah. Llamas are pretty Probably. That's their relevance. They're the best ones.


That's their relevance. You're asking like, what are llamas for? Yeah, they're here. They're For making costumes. So for costumes. Yeah. And. Staying with Animals. I I bought a horse. Man, you bought a Horse. That I did see this. How about That. Old Swift delivery. Swift delivery. So did the name prompt interest or did the horse Horse? I'll say, you know, when the stars align, you know, it's just, it feels good to jump on. So how did the start on board, how Does one go about buying a race horse or even finding out how to buy a racehorse? Take us through this process. Yeah, so you have, you have really good friends. That are good people. That are into horse racing. That. So the Zins. Yes. The Zins.


Bruce And. Alex Zin. I've known Alex for about 10 ERs. Plus now since I've been in the league. And Fellow Ohio in, shout out to your Youngstown family. That. We all got And. Yeah. The olds are just, they're an awesome family. They, they own Phantom fireworks. One of my favorite fireworks stores up in Ohio. And And. Throughout the Midwest or really throughout the country. And. I've just, I've had so much fun going to events with them. And just building our relationship. And. Sure enough, they were at the Super Bowl. Yeah. They came. They invited me to the Derby. This Year, And. I had one of the best times ever at the Derby. Love it. ERs. They were my host. And. Sure enough, I was like, man, that'd be fun to like Get involved And. Like see one of your horses, like in a race like That, That, That seems like it would be a fun, fun thing to be a part of.


Knowing That. They've actually had a horse win in I. Think it was the early two thousands. It was, it was a horse called Magic Kingdom. Magic Kingdom. Yeah. It was a fun name. Like the Disney name. Yeah. They won the Derby. That ERs. And. Wow. Yeah. Sure enough. They, they asked me if I wanted to jump in on a three Year old That. They had And. The name was it. It made sense to, to team up with this one. It being swift delivery. What's cool ERs That. The, the, the different style of horses. Some, some horses Get out to a fast start. And try And like lead the pack. And just take off. And like, yeah, They're sprinters. Yes. And. Then the others are like the finishers. right. The ones That kind of come around the, the the last turn or the last two turns.


Make the ones. That got the enlarge hearts make straightaway stretch. You have, That's let some less. So that's my question. Does Swift delivery have an enlarged heart? No. Do you know how big its heart ERs? No. See That'd be the first thing I'd be doing. ERs I'd be getting a ultrasound. And seeing how thing big this thing's heart ERs. Yeah. Well. That's you. I just got on board. 'cause it was fun. And I could team up with a good friend of mine. I don't, I'm not in it to look at the size of the hearts. And I, like the way That Swift delivery ran. I've seen like three or four races. That Swift Delivery's been in And. Sure enough, I heard nothing but great reviews. And, it's more of a finishing horse. It comes around That turn. And just hits. Hits. The just like top speed And kind of saves the last, the last like straightaway for with all the juice That, it's got.


So ERs you did say it ERs a three-year-old horse. So it's not eligible to participate in any of the Triple Crown races. Correct. At this point, how much longer will this thing race for And? What's the end goal? To like, hopefully it win some And. They Get studded out. You're asking questions. That I have no an no answer for you're asking me. No. Absolutely no questions. I know it's Next race ERs gonna be somewhere within the Next. Like two months. You Said it finished second place last time. Yeah. Up in Woodbine. Yeah, up in Toronto. This past weekend was second place finish. It was we weird weather. The ground wasn't the And. It's like in its best like, suited racetrack for Swift delivery.


So. we still got a lot of faith in it. So Swift delivery ERs a, a dry track racer. It's not a good on the wet track. I'm Not sure how it switched I. Just know That the it, it didn't make it easier for Swift delivery. Have You thought about giving it more steroids to improve its second place? Finish the first place. It does not. I'm not answering That question because it does not take steroids. What do you think? This ERs the 1970s. Everything's regulated now. Jason. Oh man. We actually care about the horses. Are you sure? Jason Just leave it at That. Alright. Right. And. Lastly, Travis got a shout out from the king himself. LeBron James.


LeBron James. He was asked to name his tight end Mount Rushmore. And. He named Travis first. The number one tight end Northeast Ohio baby. Which I Don't know I. I mean. He did name me first. It was a, it was very clear in the video too. He went right to Travis, then he went Kellen, Winslow s Shannon Sharp actually. Then he went Tony Gonzalez, Kellen Winslow, Sr. And, Shannon Sharp And. Then retroactively I. Think somebody was like, Hey. You might wanna put Gronk up there. And. He ERs like, oh crap. I forgot about Gronk. That's the way the video seems. And. He took Tony off. And put Gronk on. So his final Mount Rushmore ERs. Travis, Gronk, Shannon, And, Kellen Winslow Sr. He checks the list.


All five of those guys you could take me off of there. And put those four up there. And. It'd still be the same list. Yeah. I feel like the guys That have played before me. Helped make the league so That I could have the success I've had in the league. And. That includes Gronk. That includes Tony. That includes even Kellen Winslow Senior who played back in I. Think like the seventies And eighties. So yeah, And, Mount Rushmore ERs more of like a, that's more of like a historic presidents. Like you don't have like new presidents like on Mount Rushmore. So maybe Gronk, Travis And, maybe even Tony. Tony's pretty new I mean he's pretty modern. Tight end. What? Who would be the classic tight ends? That should be Mount Rushmore man. Mean Kellen Winslow Sr. Yeah.


Mike Dicker. Mike Dicker. Maybe Ozzy Newsom on there. Ozzy Newso. Ozzy. Ozzy. Mike. Yeah. I. Think Ozzy might have it's fourth Nineties. That's a Cleveland Brown guy. You gotta put him up There. Yeah. 100%. Who else? Who's the fourth tight end I. Don't even know if I can name a fourth tight end from back then. Who's the guy? That caught the pass from Joe Montana in the end zone. What's That Guy's name? That was Clark. Clark That was a wide receiver. He was a wide receiver. Are. you kidding me? He looks like a tight end Okay. RP The legend. Yeah. You would've to put Shannon up there if you, if you're Shannon. Shannon's a modern guy too. I'm talking about like pre I mean what's technically Tony And Shannon played in the nineties. If you, if He played Football before the Steroid era. Right. Didn't Ozzie play in the nineties or was he before That?


I. Think he's before the nineties. Ozzy Newsome. Ozzy Newsome was, he might, for Whatever reason, I, he might was like 89 guy nineties I. Think Ozzy was like similar to Kellen Winslow. right. Makes sense. Ozzy Newsome, he finished playing with the Browns in the Year 1990. So he was, he was really the eighties. I knew it. Kellen Winslow Senior. Yeah. So they played in the same timeframe. Yeah. DKA ERs also probably somewhere in That. Same window, right? Yeah. He's probably more Eighties. He's seventies. Yeah. He was 85 Bears. He was the head coach. Yeah. John Mackey Don't just reach for John. Mackey are, are these the only, are all the other ones gonna be New age Tight ends?


Shannon? Travis. Gronk, Tony, Antonio Gates. Yeah. So I. Guess it's Mackey. 'cause I can't even Name it. That mean Mackey. Mackie's. The, the original, like the Mackey award ERs the college ncaa like tight end of the Year award. It ERs, let's see what his stats are. I mean It's A different game. It's a different game. So let's not compare the stats. Okay three time. First team all pro five time pro bowler And. He was like the, the like you said, he was like kinda like the founding father of the tight end position ERs. Dicka was Ozzy kind of transformed it into the nineties. And. Then our guys, Tony And, And Shannon took it over. Yeah. 'cause like Mount Rushmore, those guys are all like I mean three of 'em are real old And.


Then you got Roosevelt up there who's like, when was Teddy Roosevelt a president? God Damnit Early 19 hundreds. Teddy Roosevelt, This entire episode ERs just gonna be us searching shit. God damn. I didn't know Teddy Roosevelt looked like Andy Reed. Dude. I just know he ERs big on the parks. Presidential term 1901. All right, I'll take That. 1901. 1901 to 1909. Dude, how ERs That possible. Aren't the presidents usually the even ERs? 'cause it's every four ERs. You know what I mean? You got me out At one. At what point We're asking the wrong questions. I'm just so confused. I thought it was every four.


All right. Whatever. There's a leap Year in there somewhere. That fucked up the Alright. Right, whatever. Alright. Right. Where do we go from here? All Right. Good list. LeBron, thanks for giving my brother a shout out. Sure. Ridiculous. Shout out to LeBron baby I. Appreciate you brother Finally. Somebody agrees. That I belong on the mountain. Rushmore

Wow. Wild. What would your Wild West name be? You gotta have like a cool, like, gun slinger name. Like your porn. Your porn name ERs, like the street you grew up on. And. Then like your, your dog's name or some shit. right? So what's, no, it's the, how do you figure out your Western it? It's your first pet's name. And the street you grew up on. Okay. You know this a little bit too, too low Flash. Coal Ridge, Fat Flash Coal Ridge, Man. It's gonna be in everybody's search. How do you figure out your western name? We might have to go to the 90 Percenters. How do we figure out our western name? How's A western name decided? What's a good Western name? Big Yeti. Maybe you can, what's, what's another form of big tumble weeds? Think Tumbleweed Cactus.


John Cactus. What? The the bearded bandit. Who was who? What would be The revolver? Ooh. Nice. What's kind a good, that's the band Name. What's Travis's Western nickname? 92 Percenters. Yeah. I I. Don't even know how you figure That out either. Can you tell us how to figure it out? Or if you guys just got a couple Western nicknames. There's Gotta be some people in this comment section. That are big time Western movie And culture fans. They just had great nicknames. Even NFL back in the day. There's something about nicknames. Wow. Wow, wow. Like that's Big Red. Why ERs he red? Because he's got red hair. Yep. What's like a great nickname of an old Football player?


Shoeless. Joe Jackson. That's a baseball player. But that's a great Mean. Joe Green. We gotta come up with a good one. Chiefs Aholic. Well. The Fi, the 53 Man roster ERs officially out for the Kansas. City. Chiefs And. Here are a few players. That Chiefs fans are excited to see this. Year Travis. Let's Get your thoughts. Alright Right. Let's do it. Baby. Rookie, wide receiver. Xavier worthy. That's s Right. The man with the fastest 40 time ever. Does That speed translate to the field? Here's some Highlights. Quick. Yes it does. You can watch his Travis answers this question. I'll Say this. Some guys have the speed And. Some guys are just Football players. Man. His He's intelligent. He's intelligent. He's picking up on the offense. Very smooth. He can see things. And reacting. So his reaction And, his awareness ERs up there.


And. Then on top of That, he has absolute speed. That ERs. Unworldly. Yeah. It's just on a whole nother, a whole nother like stratosphere in terms of his stride. Like once he gets going, man. So He's a strider. That was gonna be my question. ERs. ERs. He ERs he a Don't Get me wrong. Tyreek kill, quick burst, agility driven player. Yeah. Or ERs. This a linear, like take the top off a defense or both I. Think he I. Think he's a little bit of both. I. Think he's his Stride ERs more, you know, a relevant, how tall ERs he than how quick he ERs. He I. Think he's s right around six foot. He's somewhere in there. I might be lying. He might be smaller than That ERs. He taller than me. I don't know you're asking questions. That nobody knows. Jason. 5, 5, 11, 6 Foot. Pretty much you're right on it.


Yeah. When he runs, does he run like a robot or does he have That fluidity? No, he ERs fluid. He's a fluid runner. He ERs very smooth. That kind of comes with the stride. And. He ERs I. I'll say this, I'll say this. He's very, he's like, I said he's a smart guy. So he ERs understanding the offense. And. He ERs understanding when Pat ERs going to want to come to him on the route. Yeah. And. That's the biggest thing in this offense. And, that's the biggest thing kind of getting used to ERs a rookie ERs being able to see And. Trust what you're seeing. So That, you're on the same page. ERs your quarterback. And And. He's doing a great job with it so far. And. It's, I'm excited for him, man. He's, he seems like one of those guys. That rises up to the occasion when the lights are on. And.


I'm, I'm pumped for him, man. For the life of me. I don't know why other teams keep allowing Andy Reed to draft the fastest human beings. He did it with Deshaun Jackson. Yep. Did it with Tyreek Hill. Yep. And. Now he's Don it with Xavier worthy And. It's always fun to see a fast receiver And an Andy Reed offense. God dang. He's gonna right, he's gonna dial some fun ones up. Not right now. All right. There's also a new fan favorite undrafted rookie. Carson Steele. Man, that's a good Football name. He ERs bringing the fullback back to kc. He ERs I. Think he ERs a little bit more than a fullback too. He ERs he's athletic And. He can, he can do some things with the ball in his hand on top of That. He ERs. He's a big special teams guy or whatever you need me to do. Coach kind of guy.


So you're gonna be seeing some, some of Carson Steele, whereas I like to call him Dundee. Dundee short for short for Crocodile Dundee ERs That because of the alligator That he had In, in a picture. He's got a gator he's had for, for a while now. ERs one of his birthday presents from his father. I believe his Dad got him. That That tells you a lot about him. Yep. Okay, And, I. Guess you need like a hundred permits to have a, have a gator up in Indiana. Dad, Your dad's getting you an alligator. So don't Get don't, don't think That. He's doing this illegal. A tough son of a gun. You know it man. This, This ERs the real life. Bobby Boucher basically. Yeah. Very good. He sounds like a guy. That I would call a tweener where he can do a lot of different things. Almost like a Kyle use check.


I don't wanna put him in That category until he starts playing games. But there's this world in the NFL, That, Kyle Shanahan, a lot of these offenses have Don where they've, you take like a guy, That can play fullback tight end. You can even split out wide And. You can all of a sudden Get to all these formations. You can Get to I. You can Get to tight end wing. You can Get to three by one. Like there's a lot of different ways you can utilize a guy like this, which improves the I. Don't know just the amount of plays. And informationally, what you can do. Yeah. I'll be curious to see how Andy starts utilizing them. And, it's another formation. Another piece to the puzzle. That. The defense has to be ready for And I.


Think Andy Reed's offenses have typically had That fullback type player. We didn't necessarily have him last Year, but this, this Year. We really have a guy like, like Carson That can just, he can do more than just what a typical fullback can do. Which makes it harder on the defense to have to, you know, account for That. It's Hard to find the guy. That can do fullback. And do That. Like usually the fullback guy ERs like a meathead. I, I. Think Anthony Sherman right away from your guys. Sure baby. Like Sherman, one of my favorite teammates of all time. Well. He's Guy That. Everybody loves 'cause he does all the work That nobody else wants to do. Which ERs basically just run full speed. And blast your head into this other person ERs hard ERs. You can, yeah. And. It's rare to find a guy that's willing to do That And.


Then also athletic enough to do all the other stuff. Yep. It's hard to find. That guy. That guy has a ton of value if you do find one of them. Exactly. And Shem was a huge special teams guy. ERs Well Well. We actually, I'm pretty sure he filled in playing safety for us. One, one day, one Year stop. He also, he also was our start running back against the Denver Broncos. A few ERs back. You Get it Don now. Oh yeah. Ator. He's, he was one of the, he's one of the best fallbacks. He's one of my favorite guys to play with. Man. Run a lot of downhill plays. Don't Get him going east, west, just Get the big fella moving north. And south. So he ERs a he's gonna be a fun piece to, to see how Andy Reed uses And. And. Sure enough, I think he's gonna, he's gonna help out the team a lot. This Year man. Well, one of the great things about Carson Steele ERs, he ERs just got a Football name.


Carson Steele I mean it's asking for a great nickname. I'm just gonna go with old Dundee or I'll just call him Carson. 'cause his name ERs Carson And. Here's the picture. Why you call him Dundee? Here's his alligator. Very juicy I mean. That's a big alligator, bro. At real deal at his neck. That's how you know That. This guy's willing to run into things when your neck ERs my neck ERs wider than your skull. Yep. My neck. You're Gonna be good at running Into stuff. My neck ERs like right here. It's, it's aligned with like the outsides of my eyes. Typically, you'll notice most people's neck ERs not wider than their jawline. Yep. That means That means they hit the fuck out of things. Yeah. That means when you hit somebody with a, with a neck that's not wider than your jawline. It exposes your spine a little bit.


But when your neck ERs wider than your ears, you're not your, your head's not gonna move anywhere. You're basically a torpedo at That point. That That means you are safe. And. You, you have your seatbelt on. That's exactly what That means. So this Guy's earrings a neck wider. Look at his quads. This guy just been doing leg extensions all day. I didn't even Get quads like That. Dude. He put on a, like a le like a leg sleeve for like recovery And like to, to reduce like swelling And stuff. Yeah. On his legs. And, he was wearing it. And. He expanded the sleeve so much. That. It looks like he, it looked like he had pantyhose on the only Way I could be more like my stock higher on this guy. if he had a bunch of tattoos.


Like if he had a bunch of like, just like Jeremy Shockey tattoos. I'd be like, I'm all in on Carson Steel. He's got an alligator earrings a neck wider than the fricking Nile River And. He's got quads more cut up than s something super cut up I. Don't Know. It looks like his quad ERs overflowing over his knee Right Here. Doesn't it make sense? You can't even see his kneecap because of how big his quad muscles are. I don't even know That. You do this S Dog cars. He's getting torched Right now. Fucking hat. Look at how skinny That hat looks with his neck. This guy's fucking doing four-way neck. I'm telling you. All right man. He Could probably run into a brick wall.


And fuck That Wall up pretty Much That Wallet. I I. Feel bad for That Wall. Yeah. right, right. Let's Get to the Next guy. Hollywood Brown. Hollywood Brown Baby. Probably the Biggest off season movie you guys made outside of the draft or anything else with signing Hollywood. Brown or I mean we'll Get into some of the extensions And stuff here in a little bit. But. yeah. Hollywood Brown. Veteran wide receiver. But unfortunately he ERs hurt right now. ERs That Safe to say. Has there been any injury information that's been released On Hollywood? He's getting better. Yeah, he's getting better. I'm pretty sure it's public knowledge. That. He ERs he's out with one. He Declared out for this week. Yeah. He's excited to be able to play with Pat Mahomes in this offense. He's, he's seen success. He's seen how it's ran.


And sees the accountability. That ERs put on the wide receivers. And. He ERs excited about That, man. He's very smart. Another guy, That came into the building immediately wanting to learn, wanting to understand the nuances. And, And, the little And, the little things. That That make this offense go And. He, he's, he's very detailed in his work. And And. And a smart, smart player. That can play fast, man. He, when he was out there, he's out there rolling And. He'll be an asset for him. ERs soon. ERs he gets back to full strength. Man. That's awesome. What, what? He hurt Something. Something in the shoulder. I believe Okay one of those shoulder things. Yeah. And, other chief's roster News. Creed Humphrey got paid.


He set the bar brand new for centers. Man, it must be Nice to play center. Signed a four Year, $72 million contract extension. Yeah. Damn. Including 50 million guaranteed. He ERs now the highest paid center in NFL history. Damn. And. He deserves every second, every penny of That contract Creed has been really since he got in the league, which has been unique for him. For the center position, typically there's like a, there's a onboarding process where you learn the trade. And, you gotta not Creed. He's been great from day one. He's been one of the best in the league. And. He doesn't I mean I Don't anticipate That slowing down anytime soon. And, this ERs four Year extension for 72 million.


Yes sir. So yeah, that's a big deal worth Every freaking penny. Like you said. Do we Know what it, the a PY ERs? He now in like I. Think he's like 16, 17 Year. 16. Yeah. Yeah. Well, Don, Bubba. Yeah. No, he ERs he ERs. Like we said, he ERs worth every single penny. Man. He's so, he's just so good at in between the tackles in space, getting to second level. He, he's one of those guys. That can just do it all. Man on the offensive line. And. And. On top of That, a guy That takes command. A guy That That ERs in terms of a leader ERs showing everybody nothing but the best. And. I'm just happy ERs hell for the guy. One of my favorite teammates on this team, And. Sure enough, I didn't know it was this much money, but I I knew That.


He, he got the extension during our preseason game. The news during the game, the news leaked during the game. That, he was signing an extension. He Went in there And, he signed his contract. And then got a hot Dog in the locker room. And went back out of the Isn't That. What a day. What a day. Hell at the ballpark. That's a way To sign That. Right. That's a day at the ballpark. Baby. Okay. $50 million. And. That's good. Okay. Where's the hot dogs? I can smell 'em. Yeah. So shout out to Creed for getting That extension. The core of the, of the Chief's offensive line ERs now signed for an extended period of time here. So Chief's Kingdom, you can Get pumped on That. Well Don Creed. Well. The other thing we've been hearing about all off season ERs, the three-peat.


Yep. That's the storyline everybody ERs talking about with the Chiefs I. Don't know if you know this, but it's never been Don before. I'm sure nobody has mentioned this to you guys. I did my research. The one thing I've been noticing, you guys have talked, you guys have been pretty open about discussing the Threepeat ERs That Fair to say I haven't told who have I talked to about it. I feel like the first time I heard about the Threepeat was from you guys, right? After that you won the, the second one. That's Probably the only time we've really talked about it. So Now you guys are more focused on to We this getting re week one. Right. You don't Get to the Super Bowl by thinking about winning the Super Bowl. You Get to the Super Bowl by slowly creating this routine of success. Week in, week out. We, We have to be a better team in December.


And January. And in February than We are Right now And, we know That. It's a process. That, you have to go through. You know, you can't peak too soon. You can't, you can't look That far in advance. And, just assume That, you're going to be there. You gotta make sure That you, you're present every single day. Yeah. And, you're, you're putting in the work in practice. You're putting in the, in the time to, to Get. right? Mentally before the game And. Then on top of That being real with yourself when you do play And, if it's a good game, it's a bad game. Always finding a way to, to Get better And I. Think That mentality. And That, That formula of success That Coach Reed has implemented here. I think That itself. ERs That's the, that's what you gotta focus on.


You can't focus on anything down the line like That. Before we wrap up, chief's talk, let's talk a little bit about the season opener against the Ravens. This ERs a rematch from the A FC championship game. Last Year Trav, you missed week one last Year against the Lions. It was a first game you missed in. Thanks for the reminder. What Was That? Nine seasons. 10 seasons. I I was I sucked Jason. All right. right. Was we Don That. I was, I felt older last Year than I feel Right now. That's how I lost That game. This game will have the banner raising. Which ERs? Which ERs the last celebration of last year's Super Bowl. Are you ready to Finally? Stop talking about last Year. I'm d I. Haven't I. I'm so Don. I have, I'm not even bringing up last Year.


Yeah, You just bring it up every time you talk to me. What? No I. Only I bring up two ERs ago. You'd never stopped talking about it. You're like, oh, I. Don't know if you know this, but we won the Super Bowl last Year. No I always say we won the last two ERs. You make sure they're hard. I. Think I. Think That. I'm so Don with this. I was kind of Don with talking about last Year After that After that ring ceremony. I'm so thinking forward, And thinking about this, this, this game. Yeah. We're focused on, on Thursday. I'm so focused on this Year And, just like I said, trying to, trying to Get better every single week. Man, Well Trey Smith ERs with you. He weighed in on this question winning the Super Bowl last. Year, no one cares about That.


It's nobody care about That shit. New We care a lot. Nobody cares. s Right now we're focused on, it's a completely new season. We have to prove ourselves week in, week out. Love That quote from Trey. He's also one of my favorite guards of watching the league, watching That lot. I love That guy. Man, fuck. It's The most exciting for no reason at all. Do you wanna watch Trey Smith wreck somebody? Shit. Yes. It's like you read my mind Brandon. How'd you know I wanted to see this? ERs this the DB one. This ERs like, yeah, this ERs like you just watching. Yes, This good evasion. Slaps em by him gets flat. That's the most important thing. Nobody knows this. Right After. You Get That release. You gotta Get flat. If you go upfield, if you go up field, you're gonna miss That block. He goes flat. And then just cocks this dude in the side of the Head.


It's all about angles. It's all about angles in this league. God I love this block. That's Football son. Ah, that's Football son. That's how Football ERs supposed to be played. That ERs not an anomaly. Re Smith does these kind of blocks all the time. That's why we love him, man. Do you Have any thoughts on the Ravens leading up to this first game? You just played him in the a FC title game. Two very similar teams from last Year. Not a lot of changes, obviously they lost Patrick McQueen. They've added Derrick Henry player. They lost Javian. Clowny. He's, he's a great player. Gino Stone, they have a new defensive coordinator was promoted within, so you probably can assume it'll be a similar system. ERs to they ran last Year since it's somebody That was in the organization. Yeah. And, That, And. They, they have similar pieces.


Don't Get me wrong I mean Clowny might not be there, but they still got Edge, edge rushers. They still got a yeah, have a great defensive line. They have a, a core good linebackers. Yes, And. Then on top of That, they got one of the best secondaries. Definitely one of the best safeties in Kyle Hamilton who I think they'll give even more responsibility to now That. He's, you know, even more comfortable in the league having the, the, the unbelievable season he had last Year. Do You think Kyle's gonna want revenge I? Think the entire team ERs definitely gonna be fired up for this one. Yes. I've been in a situation where I've lost an a FC championship game. And a Super Bowl at That. Yeah. And. The Next season. You come out pretty fired up. And And ready to to w wreck havoc, man.


Love it. So, we we'll lot to match That intensity. And, And, And make some plays, man. That's the end of the, at the end of the day when That ball's in the air, We gotta make the catch. And We gotta Get the run game going. We have to Get the run game going. You heard Roan Smith earlier this week. Talk about how you stop him. And. You gotta make him one dimensional ERs what he ERs saying, And. Hopefully we have the, the full arsenal on firing on all cylinders. Well, Best luck. Should I go? Should I go to the game? Am I invited? I've never been in That for you situation. I don't have anything to do with this. I got a ticket for you, but that's about it. All the other tickets are fucking sold. So I can't invite Dad. You know how Blake gets Dad's already coming.


I figured. Yeah. All Right I. Guess That wraps up week one. Chiefs verse Ravens,

We're not gonna take That away from the, the Philly 92 Percenters. That. We got Don't take Philly. Don't take It away. Once a bird, always a bird baby. Mm. He might have retired, but Jason will not leave the building. That's s right. Jason, do you still have a, you still have a locker in the locker room? I have a locker in the staff portion of the building. Your Staff. Staff. I'm, I'm with. You know anybody from accounting or Oh, Nice. Whoever wants to go. Get a workout in. I'm in That, part of the locker room. I love That for you. Yep. Sexy. Batman was back in the Eagles training camp though.


He made a, he made a a ride back over to what ERs it. Nova Care center. Nova Care center. That ERs. Correct. Nice Helping out holding bags. And stuff. Did you just become like a, a, what ERs it? A dummy Bag Holder punching bag. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I. Don't even remember holding this bag. So this ERs interesting, but I would love to, I actually would wanna put, start putting cleats on And, giving the guys looks. And stuff like pre-practice. I. Think there's some things That help out there, but I just haven't had the time. And, you know, I'm so in my busy schedule. It's just tough. Gosh. Selfishly, I wanna stay involved in the game. You know, I, Get to do, go And. Talk to Stout Cam.


Jergen's New start center, obviously. Yeah. But a veteran in his own Right, right? He's In his third Year. He ERs his second Year ERs a start. your first Year ERs at center. But he ERs played the position a lot. So And, he ERs been in action. He's seen Live Bullets, man. No doubt He's, he's gonna be great. I. Feel like the more connected you say to the game, the better I'm gonna be for Monday Night. Football. Selfishly And. Then also the more you just stay sharp in terms of like overall Football Has ESPN or the NFL told you That, it's Okay for you to be in the building. And still do commentary or I? Guess it isn't commentary. It's like pre half game And Post. Because Tom Brady just got told he couldn't be a part of an organization.


And We Can't be an owner. Correct. But you can be like a scout And still do it. I Don know. Or wouldn't That still be I? Dunno what the I think. It's the, the rule ERs affiliation with a club. Dunno. Rules. Yeah. I. I. Don't know what the rule ERs for me. I'm not accepting any money from the Eagles. s right? Like Don don't have an official position. I'm really just going there out of pure interest on my own to keep my knowledge base of the game up. And, obviously I built up a lot of relationships with the people around That building. That, you know, I, I'm gonna help out in any way I can. But the reality ERs, that's not my job, Tom. He was, he's just, he's now not allowed to have like production meetings with other teams.


And, Get, the access in the building, That all the other broadcasters technically had, like this week we got the NBC cast. And. We got Mike Tico, And, Chris Collinsworth, I. Love those guys, by the way. Yeah. They're so fun to talk to today. Just the absolute best in terms of calling a game. They're just class acts with it. I. Think That Tom isn't allowed to do That. He like, he's not allowed, like my meeting with with Tom would've never happened. I don't think he's even allowed to like do production calls. I think he still ERs. ERs he an owner Of the Raiders. Yeah. I. Think that's of the Raiders. I thought That That fell through because of what we're talking About. I'm pretty sure they just made it to where he can do it, but he's not allowed to be on production.


And kind of Get That insight from other teams inside school stuff. Yeah. Alright, Right, Howie Roseman told Kay Adams, he tried to recruit you ERs a scout. I. Think Jason would be great at anything in Football. I. Think he'd be a heck of a evaluator. I tried to recruit him to come work with me too, because he can even, he can evaluate players very Well. When we were in the draft, I gave him a few centers. That, we really liked And. He came out And said I love Cam. Jergens. And. Luckily I I only gave him the players. That. I. Like, so I can't come up with somebody else, so he Can't. Yeah, this ERs the real key. They gimme guys That. They already like And.


They just all they want ERs for me to affirm what they already think. They don't want me to come up to 'em. And be like, Hey I actually like this guy over here. But. yeah. Cam Jergens ERs the guy. That I liked a lot. Landon Dickerson. I liked him more. ERs a guard coming out. A lot of teams are looking at him. The center. He would do center just fine. But his skillset, in my opinion, translates more to be more impactful with the guard position. But I also like other guy. I mean. Listen, I think I have fun watching Football. And looking at the eyes. And, it's so interesting watching players And like almost Right away. You kind of like, oh, I like what That guy's doing. Right there. I. Like the way he moves his hips. I like the way he sinks I, like the way he ERs out in space. And, he mirrors people. You're, you're taking all That into consideration.


But I'm partly not accepting a position because I wanna be able to be honest in my assessment ERs an individual media member. Although I think everybody knows, I'll always be biased towards personal relationships. That, I have with the Eagles. Maybe that's in the future, but not in the cards right now. Well, Nick Sirianni also said That the door ERs open for you to join the Eagles coaching staff. We'll see maybe, maybe one day. I I know selfishly I would love coaching, but that's a big time commitment. That at this point in time. I'm not willing to make, maybe down the road. Yeah, we'll see. Well ERs an unofficial Eagle Scout And coach. What do you think of the 2024 Eagles brother I?


Think they're immensely talented. I think they had a lot of talent. Last Year, especially on offense. And. I. Think That. Some things stalled out. I. Think That. This Year, they're gonna be really good. They've improved on defense. They've added new pieces in the secondary. They've drafted some guys. And have some, have a more Well rounded goop. Defense line wise I think they're, they're very good linebacker ERs. The question mark I think it's waiting to see how Dean comes back. And, some of these new guys fit in I, like the linebacker's coach. I've talked to him. And, I. Think That I. Just think they're gonna be really good I. Think they have a lot of talent. I. Think That Jalen Herdz ERs gonna have a bounce back. Year I think they have two coordinators who have proven success in the league.


And, Kellen Moore, now And, Vic, Fangio, And I. Think That last. Year. There was a lot in place. After losing those two guys. And, the the previous coordinators. And Shane, Steichen And, Jonathan Gannon, And. For whatever reason it didn't work. There's a lot of reasons for That, but I think That with these two guys here. They've, they've won a lot of Football games. They've, they've Don a great job at calling plays on both sides of the ball. I think when you, when you take into account good play, calling with really highly talented individuals, it would be shocking to me if they don't perform at a very high level this Year. Yeah, they got a whole lot of talent.


That's what, damn, I'm sure Well, the media has been asking Jalen Hertz on his thoughts on the, on the first season, not on the receiving end of Jason Snaps. He's probably thankful for That. His take was, we had a great player in Jason Kelsey who took on a a lot of responsibility. And ERs a result of That. I was told not to worry about a lot of things, And. So my, my eagerness to learn over the ERs was kind of halted And. But now times are different. Which sounds like Jalen took his game to another level. Man, you God love That. There's A lot of media in Philadelphia. That are blowing this into like a negative assessment. Like he's making an excuse or something. Like That And. No, I've shared this exact sentiment with Jalen I.


Think he's at the stage now in his career, That. He can take That Next step forward in making a lot of these protection calls. And things That I did for him early in his career when he ERs a young player. He's, he's seen a lot. And I. Think That. A lot of the things we struggle with late in the Year with the blitzes. When teams do a great job of disguising things, And, you really don't know if you can where to direct it. The quarterback has to feel comfortable with where hot at And I think That. Jalen now controlling a lot of this And, taking this ownership on ERs gonna help, especially for situations like That. 100%. But I think him taking on this ERs a responsibility. ERs gonna accelerate his game across the board.


And, I think he's ready for it. One, from a knowledge base. Two, I think he's ready for it. Just by being a more experienced player. And, he's gonna be more of a leader. He needs to be more of a leader. And have more of this responsibility on him. So I'm excited to see how this this goes for 'em. This Year I think mixing in That portion of it ERs Well ERs. You listen, the coaches have had a full off season. They know That. They are gonna Get blitzed a lot early this Year, based on how last Year ended. They've been focused on different ways to defeat the blitz. Either from, you know, getting rid of the Football to checks, to putting the protection in ways That are conducive for the play.


Cold, And, I, think That, all of these things, That, they've been working on all off season. ERs gonna, you know, I think it's just gonna lead to a much more productive offense, especially in regards to That. So I'm excited to watch all of this take place. You can't take anything negative out of That. All you can take ERs That. He's taken the Next step. He's getting better Ladies and gentlemen. So don't take That ERs a negative thing just because it, it, it's something That he didn't have to worry about in the ERs past. Understand That. He wants to know And now he's putting in the work to figure those things out. So That, he can play better, he can play faster, he can play more confident for sure. Pat Mahomes talks about how he couldn't even read a defense the first Year he was in the league.


And. It all just, it it, you have to find That, That, That groove of wanting to Get better And And. Really, you have to have to be surrounded by coaches. And, And players, And people that'll tell you exactly how to do That, And And. How to like, figure things out. And I. Think That Sirianni ERs a great, great offensive mind or a great coach. And. Obviously Kellen Moore ERs gonna do a great job of making 'em feel comfortable. And couldn't agree more I. Just think That I. Think That. It's blowing wet out of way out of proportion. If you're looking at That ERs a negative thing. All I see ERs. That, he's getting better. And That. He's looking for ways to improve in 2024. Man. Yeah, absolutely. And I. Think Nick backed him up with this comment.


He said Jalen hurt's comments he made on the radio this week about how he will have more control this season. ERs Jason. Kelsey was previously in charge of a lot of things at line of scrimmage. He said it was Jalen being able to do some things at line of scrimmage. And, Kelsey handling a big portion of That. So yeah, what he said ERs a hundred percent true. I. Think That. You know, I've made this exact statement to Jalen I. Think he's ready to take this Next step. And I. Think in some ways it's gonna help him become a better player. I. Don't think reading into this negatively I. Think Trav. You hit on it. Really. Well ERs Well. I'm excited to watch how Jalen, you know, grows. ERs a player. And, I. Think Well. He's coaches. He's ERs Well. He's, he's proven a lot of people wrong when they, when they, when they doubt him. That's the doubt.


Damn sure man. And I. Think the coaches. And, And, And, Nick, Siri, And, everybody involved. There's been a lot of attention put on a lot of this stuff all off season in an effort to fix it. So it's always interesting playing new coordinators. Week one, especially guys. That weren't promotions from within. The Eagles are playing a coordinator, Jeff, it's like Halfly or Heley. I. Forget his last name, but he's been like a Year in San Fran And. Then the, like the last five or six ERs he's been in college. And. It's like, you know what ERs this guy gonna do. Yeah, it'll be interesting. I don't really know what to expect. You know, the Packers for the most part have been a three, four system ERs of late And. This guy's kind of got a lot of stuff in his, in his veins.


So it'll be interesting to see what it looks like. Well the best thing, the best thing ERs, he's got a lot talent around him, baby, No doubt. And. He's got a big offensive line That that's gonna be able to run the ball. And. So it's, it's one thing if it was all on him, but I think he's got a lot of guys That. He can, he can help him along the way. And half the battle ERs just getting That ball in their hands, man. And letting him be special themselves. I mean. That's what you already said. Big offensive line. Then we signed Seon Barkley like, dude, I mean it's And. Then you look at the weapons outside, there's a ton of talent in Philadelphia. I just think That. They're gonna I, think they're gonna answer the bill. So Well this Year I went up to Syria. And, he was like, yeah, How about we dial some more shit up for my God. Dallas Godard man, dude, He's a, he's a slept on guy.


Not a lot of the general public realized Dallas ERs a stud, people in Philadelphia know. But he's got all the tools. He's a sneaky, sneaky, savvy route runner. He's, he's got That wiggle. When you turn on That film, you see it, man. Yeah, Exactly. It might not be in the stat book ERs much, but when you turn on That film, you see it, man. For sure. All right. Well Eagles down in Brazil. Friday night How about That the Packers How about it. Man. Eagles play the Packers down in Brazil on Friday night. Can't wait to see That one. Sao Paulo And. Shout out to the birds. That's all I got You about to say something. No, all Right let's Get to the multi-view week one.


Preview How about That.


Last order of the business before the NFL season rolls out. We gotta decide which games we're putting on our NF. NFL. SUNDAY TICKET, Multi-View. Okay. Now that's S Right because thankfully we've partnered with our friends at NF NFL. SUNDAY. TICKET And YouTube tv. And with multiview. We can now watch up to four games at once. Ooh, All Right. Which games are we watching? Let's go through 'em. What do you think Trav? Week one games. Let's see, I'll pick my first one.


So. we got Panthers, saints at one o'clock. We got Steelers, Falcons, Texans, COLS Cardinals, bills Titans, bears, Jags, dolphins. All right, Panthers. And Saints. One o'clock probably not watching this one. That's fucked up. I'm just being honest. I don't really, I'm interested to see Bryce Young man. I'm interested to see Bryce Young take another. Take another leap, right? And then on top of That. I got Sir Bank over in Nolins. We'll see. Probably not what on my multiview though. Steelers Falcons. I'm interested to see what the new Falcons look like. Russell Wilson. Yeah, his debut ERs a Steeler for some reason. He does look fitting in a Steeler's uniform.


The Broncos uniform was a little I didn't I didn't see it. This one. I. I can I like him in the steel, his uniform I kind of feel. That I kind of pick up what you're putting down And. Then Kirk Cousins baby, he's back with reckless abandon out there in Atlanta with the Falcons. Man. They got a lot of young weapons. Hopefully they can Get my guy Kyle Pitts going again man. Get That. Tight end going man. Fourth overall, overall pit for him two ERs ago or three ERs ago. Still waiting to see him. Have just absolute amazing Year knowing That. He had a thousand yards this rookie Year. Yeah, I'll Be interested to watch this one. That one might be on it. I. Think That one might be on it. Texans at Cols. You know what I think. I think this ERs gonna be a fun one.


Man I think Anthony Richardson ERs definitely on I back with the Cols. Yeah, Texans young quarterbacks going at it. CJ Stroud ERs second Year. Obviously Stefan Diggs a huge addition to That. I. Think this one's on it for sure. I think without question the Texans are gonna be on my Multiview every week. ERs long ERs. CJ Stroud's playing because I think he's one of the best young quarterbacks in the League. He's a Stud man. And, I. Wanna watch out, watch what he's doing. And. Then obviously you just talked about Anthony Richardson, the culture sneaky. They were good last Year Shany did a great job with them in Year one. Yep. They could take a big step forward this Year. But it's gonna depend on how Anthony Richard comes back from injury And plays. So I'll be watching That one to see how That unfolds. Yeah, for sure. Then We, Go And. Our guy Alec Pierce fellow.


B fellow Bear there. We go. The Bear catalog Alum, fellow Bearcat Cardinals at Bill Cardinals add bills. I. Think this one's on mine because one I Get to watch my former defensive coordinator, Jonathan Ganon in his second Year with the Cardinals I know they got Marvin Harrison Jr. Philly native love watching Marvin Harrison Senior. So that'll be fun to watch. But I'm more excited to see what the Bills offense looks like with Joe Brady now running more of That, new Orleans style system. Very different than what they have. Don. Yeah, I. Don't think I. Don't think That one's on there for me, I'm like in this Titans at Bears a little bit more than That One I. Think bears wanna see Caleb Williams I Wanna see I?


Wanna see what the rooks got? Man And his first right in his first game On That. Wanna seen with the Titans? The Titans made a lot of off season moves, man. They got, they got a new head coach. They got a new secondary And sne. They got new weapons in Calvin Ridley. I'll Tell you what I'm like looking forward to watching the Titans. They got Bill Callahan offensive line legend. They al, he I. Don't know That I've ever seen a team That. Bill Callahan has coached That ERs not a dominant running game. He's been in Cleveland. The last few ERs, our native team, the Browns, they've been outstanding since he was there. Yeah, especially up front. So I'm excited to see what the Titans look like with not And his, the reason he ERs with the Titans ERs. 'cause his son ERs the head coach. Brian Gallaghan.


So That duo could be exciting to watch with the Titans, but Very cool. What else have they? Don other I mean They made some moves. Another tight end another another fellow. Bearcat But. yeah, I'm definitely excited to see dude, the Bears offense. The pieces they've added I mean I really. I'm excited to see what Caleb will I think they've Don That, right? They have surrounded him with a ton of talent. I got Keenan Allen And. They've, they've beefed up the offensive line. Like there's a lot of, it's a very conducive volume position for Caleb Williams to go into his first Year in Chicago. So There's a lot of juice baby. There's a lot of juice over there in Shy Town. So I'm thinking Jags, And Dolphins are definitely in it for me.


I, oh, Doug Ep And versus Mike McDaniel. I. Think the Battle of Florida ERs. ERs a legit game. This Year I think the Dolphins come out Hot And end up getting them because of the speed And everybody being healthy. But Trevor Lawrence, nobody. Yeah, And, And, Tua going at it. I. Think That ERs just a, that'll be a good Year. I mean a good game to watch, man. It'll Be interesting. I'm, I'm kind of, I'm gonna watch it 'cause I'm kind of looking forward to seeing what the dolphins look like. They've lost a lot of people up front. And I feel like That system ERs so predicated on being able to run the Football effectively. Now it's a very offensive line friendly system. The Kyle Shanahan, you know, run play action deal.


They're still so fast out on the perimeter, but I, if you can't establish the run, it's tough to Get stuff going. So I'll be looking to see what they look like. But you got Tyre Hill. So you do out of the one o'clock games, I'm going Texans, Colts in Titans. Bears in Jags. Dolphins in And. I'm going Steelers, Falcons, I'm going Texas. Colts Titans, bears I. Guess I'm probably going Jags Dolphins. I gotta turn on Dougie P if he's on there. So it comes down to Cardinal's bills versus Steels. And Falcons. Yeah. I'll go Cardinal's bills. Yeah. See what my man Jonathan Guiana looks like in his second Year And. Then I don't watching Josh Allen ERs never a bad idea.


And. Then at four o'clock you could just have all the games That are on you because there's only four. You Can, Yeah. But do you Bargo Seahawks, Raiders set? Do you Have to have four? Can you do two? You two probably. You could just do three to be honest. You could probably do three or two. Yeah, but it's Two ERs. The picture bigger I think it's I thinks the same picture no Matter what kind That awkward box that's kind of sitting blank. No, they would, they, they, it goes in like a, like a tier. It's Like one big game. And then two little ones. Yeah. It's the, what did they call it when it's like middle spacing? You're not all the way far left. You're like middle spacing you's middle spaced. Brandon Borders with the, the hot take. One of those boxes can be Red Zone I. Think That's a good idea When you're doing the multiview.


You gotta pick which broadcast you're listening to. And I know for sure. I'm gonna be listening to the Fox broadcast. So yeah, for the four o'clock games, you can have all of them on the multiview. But I will be highlighting the Cowboys Browns, because That ERs gonna be the debut of Tom Brady in the booth. And I cannot be more excited to listen to what he has to say. I'm with you on That. Shout out. Where's Olson at? He's the BBO game now. Yeah. Do you want to fucking go down That Hole again? Well. I'm just saying what game ERs he gonna be doing? So he's doing Washington. I'm kind of curious what this Jade And Daniels guy Cat does. All right, that's it for our breakdown of what We got going in week one.


Remember with NFL SUNDAY TICKET And you YouTube tv. You don't have to listen to us. You can choose which live NFL games you want to put on your multiview. It's Whatever you want. It's, It's whatever you want. Like maybe you, maybe a game ERs getting blown out. Maybe we're really excited for one of these games. And, all of a sudden the Dolphins are beating the crap out of the Jags. I I. Don't wanna say That for dope Pee. Maybe the Jags are beating the crap out of the dolphins. And, you're turning off at halftime And. You throw the Steelers Falcons game on. No, It's Tyreek Hill. Or maybe it's a really tight game with the Panthers. And Saints. Good. And all, all of a sudden you do wanna watch it. You can make all That. It's a good game. I'm watch. I'll watch a good game. Yeah. I want the closest games on my mal view. That's what I want. Unless it's the Chiefs That. I Wanna see a I?


Unless it's like a, unless it's like a fucking three to three game going into the fourth quarter, then I do not Watch. Yeah, it's, it isn't an exciting game. That's Not exciting. We gotta watch some. A quarterback That can complete some passes.


All Right. All right. Now let's, let's wrap this thing up with some no dumb questions brought to you by Mint Mobile. The smart answer to saving money on premium wireless. That's s right Ladies and gentlemen. Premium wireless network while saving money. You God love it man. Two things I would love to do. Jason tweeted asking for some no dumb questions to start the season. And, we got almost 2000 replies. So shout out to the 92 Percenters. No dumb questions ERs back And better than ever. It's gonna be tough to Get through all of Them.


The first no dumb question comes from BARB. Ep A R on X. Where are y'all's grandparents never bring up you? You never bring up Mama, Mama, Mama. Where ERs she And. Jason replied with a very kind And. Straight to it. Yes, they're all dead. Unfortunately, our grandparents have passed. Yeah, but if you were on X And, you saw That come by your timeline. You got a good chuckle out of it. I guess maybe they also just made fun of me. 'cause I used the wrong version of there. Which they're I mean. Yeah, you did. Yeah. I Mean they are.


They are. Yeah. You gotta do the apostrophe Jason. make sure you just, you proofread it. You gotta reread your tweets before you press send. You are an asshole. YOUR All in the Right Nice. Or you just do That. And not care. You Know we don't talk about mama because mama ERs not what We call her grandma We call her grandmother. Grandma And the kitties. That was what her name was. Grandma And. The kitties. Yep. Everybody's got their own nicknames. Everybody uses their own specific We. We call, let's see, why didn't the girls call Kylie's mom? Nana. Nana Nice. They call Donna Dede. Yeah, they call Ed.


Which Kylie's dad. Skeeter. Yeah. And. They call Ed our dad. Pop Nice. So yeah, I think Dad kind of got the short end of the stick on all those nicknames. s right there. But It's definitely the least creative. Yeah. Grandma And, the kitties was, That was a good name. It was. It was. She Loved her. Some kitties. She had a bunch of them running around the house. You know what my latest plan to divert our family from getting a cat ERs I. Just keep telling our girls That cats are poisonous. What? Tell And now they're in this world where they, you tell them That I. Swear to God. I do. Why So That? They don't want cats. And. I don't have to deal with having a cat.


And. Make them terrified of 'em. That's sick. It's whatever they'll find out. I, I. Think lying to your kids ERs important. That's Not in this. Not in this regard. I think It's great. I think it's genius. It's a genius. Boy. Every time they're gonna go over a friend's house, And fucking scream. Bloody murder. 'cause they see a cat. That's Fine. What a That sounds like That. That person's house problem. You're a psycho man. This guy ERs ridiculous. I Gotta Get these kids on my side. Otherwise I'm in a sinking ship. They're like, Jason, cats are not poisonous. You grew up with a cat. Travis. I know they're not poisonous. I'm saying my girls don't. No, I'm saying I've got them In this world saying, why do you just Like, they Don know what to Believe like cat so much.


Kylie ERs like, they're not poisonous. Your dad ERs lying to you. And. I'm like, listen, if you have a cat, the government will come. And, take it from you because it's, they're so lethal. That. I mean they can kill you if they, they don't even have to bite you. Just them licking you. You fear their tongue. It has little needles on it. And. Then I. Pull up pictures of a zoomed in picture on a cat's tongue. And. It looks like needles. And it terrifies the fuck out of them. It's fucking great. You're fucking ridiculous. Why do you have it out for cats so much? You grew up with a cat I. Don't Know I. Just don't Want one. You know why? You just don't wanna say it. What's, why, why? I don't know. That's why I'm trying to Get.


I'm trying to Get to the bottom I. Just Don't want one I. Just don't want a cat. I. Don't want another animal in the house. My Dog already ruin the furniture. There's something about cats. That, I don't like I. Don't Know. You can't name it. They're Fine if they stay outside. I'll do an outdoor cat. I'm Okay with an outdoor cat. I. Just I. Dunno. You're fucking ridiculous. All Right Right here. We. Go I. Think I. Think they're poisonous. All right, Next, no dumb question. What color does Travis say his eyes are? What the fuck? Travis. You know That, this has been a hot topic. Everybody wants to know because everybody What? How ERs this a hot topic. Everybody Online says your eyes are green, but mom claims you have blue eyes. And. I'm not gonna lie right now I'm zooming in. They kind of look blue.


I'm telling you, dude, they switch up on you. They're not. It depends on what kind of damn I I'm having. Travis. If you look up The picture, I'm telling you what kind of, it depends on what kind of day I'm having. Do you have, what's That called? Roia or Whatever. It switches from like a bluish turquoise to like a a, a light greens for the most part. I think They're, they're grayish, which makes them sometimes look Blue. They got some gray. Yeah. If you really, if you really Get up close, it's like, it's like to green a blue, a blue, yellow, gray. Travis. I've been looking at you your I've been been looking at you my whole life. You have green eyes. That's what it says on my driver's license. Yeah, exactly. So why does our mother, a woman who gave birth to you, not know what color your eyes are?


What has shifted in her mind? That makes her think. That. You have blue eyes because I was a fucking blonde-haired kid when I was, when I was a baby. This ERs the thing. I think you were ERs a baby. Sometimes her eye colors will be different. And. Then it'll change ERs. You Get older. Yeah. That's the only way it makes sense. That mom still thinks you have blue eyes. And. Yeah. I. And s right now. I have blue eyes. Look at 'em. They're Kind I. They're kind of green though. Look at the green back there. And. Then look at my eyes. You're gonna see Blue I will say they do look bluer right now than they usually do. Totally. But they still look green to me. Yeah. My eyes are green. Mom. Mom I. Don't know. They might have been blue when I was a kid. I was a blonde-haired kid growing up. Like I'm talking about like straight blonde I was a blonde haired blue-eyed kid. How about That And. Now I'm like a brown And, gray hair And.


Then a green And gray eye. You Got a little red in That hair. Don't be going. I got red in That beard. There ain't no red in my hair. Last, no dumb question. Would you rather chug a pitcher And then run wind sprints? No. Or eat 50 wings. And hit the sled for 10 minutes. I'm assuming the pitcher ERs beer And hitting a sled for 10 minutes. I might Take. What's the difference? What do you mean In terms of wind Rin wind sprints, And, sled. What? What's the difference? I. Think a sled ERs more like you're like, it's like a weighted thing. And wind sprints ERs just like you're running. Running mean this ERs I. God damnit. Just when you think there are no dumb questions.


Yeah. right. Just questions. That make you feel dumb. That, you even have to answer 'em. I mean Chugging a pitcher. And then running. Sounds awful. It sounds stupid. ERs fuck I. I found like it sounds like I'd be very bloated. Chugging a pitcher. Sounds exhausting. Yeah. I mean I've, we've Don it, but it's, I've Don. It's a lot before, but it's, it's always like I. Regretted it Soon. Soon Finish. Yeah. About to throw up And Well. Now I don't need a drink for the rest of the night, But I might choose wind sprints just 'cause I feel like it's like both of these sound pretty miserable. Hitting A sled for 10 minutes doesn't sound That miserable. Sounds terrible. I don't like hitting a sled for one minute. I think it's sleds are some of the most like overused pieces of equipment on a Football field.


I think they're give me a guy with a bag any day of the week. Yeah. I fucking hate hitting sleds. I just do. I'll hit a crowder sled. That's about the only one. I like hitting. There's something about hitting something ERs hard ERs. You can That I. Just have a love for. So you like hitting the sled. I like hitting the sled. I like hitting a golf ball. I like hitting a baseball. I like s taking a huge slap shot on the ice. I just like hitting shit ERs. Hard ERs. I can we're We're talking about drastically different things. It's all the same. You're the impact. I like to hit things at a very high impact. You can hit somebody with a holding a bag at That. Same impact level. Okay. I. Like That too. Yeah, But I'm I Don. I don't like sled. This really comes down to I.


Think sleds for the most part are a gigantic waste of time. I'd rather hit somebody with a bag. There's like one sled I think ERs actually That functional And. That's a Crowder sled. That teaches your hips how to function And fire off into something. Really? Well I don't really like most Football sleds. I'd rather hit a guy with a bag. That moves And. It feels like I'm actually striking an individual, not like a piece of metal. That doesn't move or operate on the same planes That like a Football player does. That's fair. So I guess I'd chug a pitcher. And run wind sprints. 'cause I feel like at at least I'd Get something out of the wind sprints. That, I'd appreciate which ERs conditioning. Yeah, You'd Get out the pitcher of beer. That. You just chugged.


It'll come right outta you. I mean I chug it. After that first wind, sprint, And, then I. Get back to run a wind sprint. That would be my first time I've thrown up And. Run more wind sprints. I've spoken like a true warrior. Shout out to those college wind sprints. Fuck. That's the only time I anything would ever make me want to throw up While I ran.
